"1","South Park is probably the most misunderstood show in TV history.Sure, it does have fart jokes but what it has really involved into is a show that depicts a wide range of current events, pop cultures references, social problems through the lenses of a group of 10 year olds and all the wacky characters that surround them.The fact that the drawings are fairly simple also makes a lot of people shy away from it, but actually this show has a completely unique approach to several divisive or thought-provoking subjects. To name a few:'The Hobbit"" looks at how photoshopped photos makes society expectations of a woman's body hard to reach and the amount of pressure it may put on little girls (whilst taking hilarious jabs at Kanye West and Kim Kardashian)""You're getting old"" takes you over the nightmare that is feeling like you might be mentally older than you friends and that may make left outConsole Wars episodes dive into the consumerism involving Black Friday, video games and the world's obsession with Game of ThronesThese are all great episodes and I think the show if anything has aged well with time.The other brilliant thing about South Park is that because each episode gets produced in the span of week, it can be more up to date than any scripted show - just this season it referenced Kavanaugh nomination controversy in an episode even before he was eventually confirmed.Second 10/10 I have given on IMDb and South Park is well deserving of it.","10","7 November 2018"
"2","Initially was not sure as to whether 'South Park' would be my cup of tea at all, despite being a huge fan of animation for all my life (and still very much am). But there have been many instances of films and shows that gave me conflicted feelings before watching, but turned out far better than expected and actually being very good or more.Such is the case with 'South Park'. As of now, it is one of the highest rated shows on IMDb and was a huge ratings success when first aired, and no wonder. At its best, it's absolutely brilliant and one of the best and funniest shows there is to me. Thought that would never be said about a show known for dividing people with its controversial and ""offensive"" content, was not sure whether I would like it let alone love it and it ended up a favourite. Is it as good as it was? No, it's not as witty, daring or inventive now, but is still very funny and intelligent. That is only being said though because the earlier seasons are so good.To me, 'South Park' is much better than other popular shows like 'The Simpsons' (originally fantastic, now has declined rapidly) and 'Family Guy' and Seth Macfarlane's other shows, which never did anything for me.Can actually see though why some dislike it. A lot of the content is very controversial and not for the easily offended. The show is crude, extremely rude (possibly the rudest animated show ever), naughty, at times juvenile and less than subtle in its treatment of taboo subjects. At the same time, 'South Park' is hilarious, smart, witty and daring but also clever, sharp, irreverent and intelligent. The satirical humour is subversive and there are not many animated shows this daring, completely contradicting the tired and incredibly annoying cliché spouted constantly that animation is only for children (often by parents defending a panned family film).Often one is shocked at how much 'South Park' gets away with, everything. Every subject and every everyday issues is covered and satirised it seems, nothing escapes the writers. While subtlety completely goes out the window, so much of what 'South Park' says has a huge amount of truth and relevance (both when it first aired and still very much so now). Like good satire should it does it in a daring and perhaps divisive fashion, not holding back and taking no prisoners. This should sound like a recipe for disaster, but actually to me it was why the show is so loved and admired.There's more to 'South Park' than just the humour. The stories are very inventive, smartly constructed, cohesive, honest and relevant. The characters are some of the most memorable and iconic in recent animation, especially Cartman. Trey Parker and Matt Stone's voice work is a practical tour-De-force for both, both bringing so much individuality and personality to these characters and their writing.Not everybody seems to like the animation, personally liked the quirkiness of it myself and there are not many shows with visuals like 'South Park's'. The music is energetic and catchy.Overall, brilliant show that surprisingly became right up my street, even with the controversial content. 9/10 Bethany Cox","9","23 August 2017"
"3","Network: Comedy Central; Genre: Animated Comedy, Satire, Parody; Content Rating: TV-MA (for dark comic content and graphic language, sexual content, violence & animated gore); Available: DVD; Classification: Modern Classic (Star range expanded: 1 - 5);Season Reviewed: 10+ seasonsStan Marsh, Kyle Broflowfski, Eric Cartman and (sometimes) the ill-fated Kenny McCormick are 8-year-old boys growing up amid an adult world in the backward, frozen-over mountain town of South Park, Colorado. Their adventures, that make up creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's animated comedy ""South Park"", include fending off everything from supernatural demons to the biggest names in the Hollywood intelligentsia. ""South Park"" is several things. It's rude, crude, shocking, smart, decidedly adult, completely original, and it is indulgent in the whims and imaginations of it's creators. It's also the very best political, pop culture and current event satire on television. The show started as something of a fad - the new vulgar, don't-let-the-kids-watch show on the block. But as real world events changed, ""Park"" evolved along with them. Standing as the kings on top of a soap box they constructed out of swearing kids, talking poo, homosexual hand puppets and hermaphroditic parents; Parker and Stone where blessed with the freedom of a hit series, hip status and a network that gave them the freedom to do whatever they want. As the show aged, they matured in their storytelling abilities and the show went from shock value fad to a barbed satire of American culture. ""Park"" is brought to life with oddly beautiful, vibrantly colored 2-dimensional cut-and-paste animation. The episodes are masterfully constructed. The writing a witty showcase of Parker and Stone's love for pop culture parody, graphic violence, pornography and a bold willingness to take on the hot button issues of the week. It is a free-for-all virtuoso where nothing and nobody is safe, every establishment media position gets flipped on it's head and every politically correct sacred cow gets eviscerated. Now that's comedy - if you can stomach a barrage of extreme scatological humor with your social satire. The vomit jokes and fat jokes on ""Park"" aren't there for the sake of it, but have substance behind them. And nobody does them better. Eric Cartman, Mr. Garrison and more recently Randy Marsh (stepping up as a reliably hilarious scene-stealer) are classic characters, but Parker and Stone have gone further and developed an entire town of colorful caricatures. They aren't made to be as endearing as those in ""The Simpsons"", but aren't supposed to be. The characters aren't just vacuous idiots, and the laughs of the show come from a very socially conscious place. Straight men Stan and Kyle are the show's most underdeveloped. They serve mostly as a mouthpiece for Parker and Stone's conservative libertarian philosophy, often literally giving a speech to a crowd in the show's finale. There is not a single other place on TV where you can see environmentalists, the anti-smoking lobby, illegal immigrants, trial lawyers, news media hysteria, elitist Hollywood liberals, abortion, sex ed in schools and every celebrity from Mel Gibson to Paris Hilton all get ripped to shreds. The show pulls it off because it has a unique ability to deconstruct and reconstruct current events better than anyone else (notably Comedy Central's overrated ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart""), giving them a hilarious or supernatural explanation without moralizing getting in the way of the laughs. They take their own messages to such loony extremes it's impossible to take seriously.The cherry on top is the seemingly endless quality of the original songs provided by the creator's cover band, DVDA. With a skeleton crew that writes, directs, animates, voices and scores the show, this is independent television in it's purest form. This means it often labors on Parker and Stone's geeky indulgences - episodes center around a full-length ""Star Wars"" parody, the class gerbil making it's way up a human bowel or Timmy, a handicapped student who can only say his name. Occasionally, their shock value execution creates a gagging reaction that obscures an otherwise brilliant point (""Fat Camp""). But I'd rather have a show that challenges me than one shackled to clichés and network mandates. When ""South Park"" goes for the shocking ending, you better believe it actually will shock. Still, ""South Park"" is almost impossible to recommend in a casual sense. The show is truly an acquired taste, but one I have to come to support whole-heartedly through the years despite (and because) I have absolutely no idea what to expect when sitting down for a new episode. How rare is that? Where so many other shows cower in the corner, begging for our approval ""South Park"" is constantly taking risks and re-inventing itself. We've got terrific stunt episodes, episodes built around one joke or building to a single knock-out punch line. They use the smash-cut ending better than anyone (""There Goes the Neighborhood""). Sometimes the experiments are to it's own detriment and the episode is a 22 minute bore, but even then it's almost unheard of to find a show in it's 10th season that is still water cooler television. ""South Park"" grabs us by the collar, shakes us around and dares even it's biggest fans to come back next week for more. The show is a monument of creative freedom with a wicked imagination, a true (and hilariously funny) sense of comic timing, and an insightful, socially conscious ear that smartly reflects a point of view starving for attention in mainstream television. It is a hugely entertaining, fiercely visceral, fire-breathing, red-blooded American satire made by, for (and most appreciated by) the most jaded and discriminating TV viewers. We just don't have shows like this on TV today. Anywhere. * * * * * / 5",NA,"9 January 2005"
"4","I don't know why this show is getting such negative reviews. A lot of people (adults mainly) keep assuming South Park is nothing more than wall to wall curse words and gross out jokes. Far from it. Sure, they swear and there is an occasional gross out jokes, but the show is also filled with quality and classic humor. The plots are genius. So what if it's offensive. Big deal! For some reason, people assume that cartoons are just for little babies, and some people appear to have difficulty accepting the fact that times have changed and animation is not just for kids anymore. Face it, we are living in an age of shows like South Park. Can't deal with it? Then that's just too bad.",NA,"14 August 2000"
"5","South Park is one of the most misunderstood, and also the most intelligent shows on television.South Park is a satirical look on most anything from Western society - politics, the media, today's youth, celebrities, violence in our society, and much much more. However, instead of presenting these issues as they are, they alternately project them through the exploits of four young boys in South Park, Colorado. Unfortunately, many people take the show solely at face value, refusing to see the intelligence in it - South Park is admittedly filled with racist and sexist jokes, along with other offensive material. The problem lies within the fact that most people don't seem to understand the concept of satire and self parody. I admit that I, myself, was one of these people - for years I refused to watch that ""garbage,"" until finally a friend forced me to actually watch a whole episode, and I realized that the show was actually making a point.So, if you haven't done so, go - watch an episode. You'll feel smarter when you're done.",NA,"10 December 2004"
"6","Both cartoons and sci-fi have long been the only place where thought-provoking social commentary can take place, unmolested by censorship, and both are all too frequently dismissed because of their least important characteristics. South Park is an intelligent, humorous and thought-provoking show that is often ignored or decried by people who judge it only by the very things it deliberately throws in their face, such as profanity, simple animation, and graphic violence, because the creators know that people like this are easily offended by these things, and will always miss the point. The simplicity of the animation, for example, has been criticised by people who miss the point that it's deliberately meant to be simple, in the face of those high-budget major studio cartoons that are more concerned with using cgi and selling toys than having anything to say. Nope, this isn't a show for those who don't appreciate irony. The episodes tackle a wide range of issues, from 9/11 to violence on television to celebrity obsession to religion, through the use of comedy, which is usually the best way to handle such matters.The main characters are four children who are basically mouthpieces for their creator's opinions, expressing views that would sound arrogant coming from adults. Stan represents the liberal viewpoint, as does his friend Kyle, who as a practising Jew, allows opportunity for religious comment. Is the show anti-religious? No, but fundamentalists like to think it is. It has the essential message of 'believe what you like, but leave me alone'. And of course there's Eric Cartman, the ignorant foul-mouthed selfish redneck, and funny as hell. Sometimes I think he's there to remind us not to take anyone like him seriously. That and to provide a lot of the show's humour. Easily my favourite character. Other characters on the show usually represent majority/opposing views as the plot requires.Like any long-running show, some episodes are better than others, not all have something to say, and not all are funny. But creators Stone and Parker 'retool' the show periodically with new characters, and try to keep up with current events, and I enjoyed the latest series (8th) for these very reasons. I've watched since the beginning, but they're making an effort not to let South Park go stale.No doubt South Park will continue to be derided by those who think the most important social problem today is swearing, yet have probably never sat down to watch an episode. And beside them will be the offended parent brigade who still haven't learned that not all cartoons are for children. But the rest of us will still be here to enjoy it, hopefully exchanging righteous indignation for a few laughs and maybe a thought or two about the world we live in. If you've never seen South Park, don't listen to the hype. Watch it and decide for yourself. Hopefully you'll be glad you did.",NA,"21 February 2005"
"7","I remember when these four little boys were nothing but private greeting card art. Now look at them!In all seriousness, I love this show. This is the funniest adult cartoon there is, and thank GOODNESS Comedy Central took this series and allowed the creators to do ""almost"" anything. If there was an alternate universe for ""Peanuts"", you've hit it in ""South Park"".There are very few (if none) episodes I didn't like. We all have our favorites, and my number one is still ""Cartman Gets an Anal Probe"". I laughed until I cried on that one. The next one that is very close to that is last years (2002) Christmas Special when Jesus was ""packing"" to rescue Santa out of Iraq after he was shot down. This was one of those episodes where I DARE you not to laugh and enjoy it.The supporting cast about South Park is also stellular. The lives (and minds) that intertwine with Stan, Cartman, Kenny and Kyle are just hilarious. Chef, Mr. Garrison. Kyles Mom and Dad, Cartman's Mother, Butters, Timmy!, Sherrif Bar Brady, Principal Victoria, Wendy, BeBe, and..Big Gay Al..etc....etc..you name it, they are just too much.Wonderful and ground-breaking (even though the animation isn't state of the art) nothing is out of bounds for these guys...South Park is an instant classic and a great time to be had by all.","10","10 November 2003"
"8","The series follows a group of four third grade boys(later fourth grade) in the town of South Park, Colorado consisting of Stan(The most grounded and ""normal"" one of the group usually characterized by his cynicism), Kyle (The town's lone Jewish child with a strong willed sense of moral and social responsibility), Cartman (a fat, racist, sexist, arrogant loudmouth who goes to great extremes to bring others misery) and Kenny (the oft-muffled and indiscernible one of the group whose interest include pornography or mischief when he's not being killed in an over the top fashion). Each week the group encounter over the top situations usually spawned from a fun house mirror image of a real world controversy or news cycle, with issues such as abortion, homosexuality, economic policy, racism, sexual politics, and many other taboo subjects with edge to spare.The brain child of creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, South Park's humble beginnings stem from the creation of two shorts the duo made that served as prototypes for what would become the series (Jesus vs. Frosty). The shorts became early examples of viral media and was spread by notable figures such as George Clooney (who would later have a joke ""guest appearance"" giving guttural dog growls in the episode Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride). The series almost became a show on the Fox network during their early days having made contemporary envelope pushing content such as Simpsons, Cops, and The X-Files that all pushed the limits of what constituted ""broadcast acceptable"". While executives at the network were initially enthusiastic about the show, disagreements (particularly about Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo) would end negotiations and shift the duo's efforts to Paramount with a choice of MTV or Comedy Central. Even prior to broadcast the show was faced with poor test screenings and nervous executives, but despite all this the series became a breakout hit generated buzz with taglines like ""this is why the invented the V-Chip"" and becoming a cultural phenomenon prior to airing with $30 million in T-Shirt sales and becoming one of the most watched shows on cable TV at the time and giving mainstream credibility to the network Comedy Central beyond their one respected property Mystery Science Theater 3000 which had mainly niche appeal. In the years since its rough around the edges first season the show has become a pop culture touch stone with many of its lines, characters, and visuals taking on a life of their own becoming cultural icons. The show also is known for its razor sharp bite, fearlessly satirizing politics, culture, society, entertainment, and anything else they can get their hands on.... I only wish I liked and enjoyed the show as much as I respected it.There's no individual element I can point to as when my enjoyment of South Park diminished as the series hasn't seen any noticeable dip in quality since its first season (in fact the writing and animation has only gotten better and better while retaining its minimalist amateur charms), but more with how and what the show satirized. I can understand and appreciate the show's satire of many elements as being both funny and valid, and even episodes with basic if any satire and more of a humor focus are quite good (The Red Badge of Gayness wherein Cartman tries and almost succeeds undoing the North victory of the Civil War simply so he can win a bet with Kyle and Stan is easily my favorite episode of the series) with the show's attacks on various societal inanities being both insightful and humorous.....but then there's the other times where not only did I feel they missed the mark, they went the complete opposite direction from the mark. Episodes like Butt Out, Smug Alert, Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow, or Manbearpig are some of the most infuriating episodes of television I have ever witnessed. Butt Out plays devil's advocate for cigarette companies playing up a weird Willy Wonkaish image for the Cigarette companies while showing anti-smoking advocates as a coven of vampires willing to lie and murder. Not only does Butt Out use Cigarette Industry funded ""studies"" to say there's no evidence second hand smoke kills, this episode came out SEVEN years after Jeffrey Wigand blew the whistle on the Cigarette companies and was subjected to threats against himself and his family by third party thugs hired through backchannels by Brown & Williamson and created debunked dossiers filled with lies. There's nothing wrong with playing Devil's advocate, but this isn't Devil's Advocate, it's Devil's Cheerleader! If they didn't read the Vanity Fair article, fine, but there's a bloody movie by Michael Mann (The Insider) that covers it! This same approach is utilized in other episodes outside Butt Out with similar aggravating disregard for reality and utilizing other industry funded studies that of course look favorably upon the industry because if you're grading yourself, why grade yourself anything but an 'A'? And the fact that Stone and Parker don't bother pointing out that falicy in industry funded research shows a remarkable lack of self awareness in two individuals whose careers are built on ""Fearless Satire""South Park earns my respect because it says what it wants without a filter. Agree or disagree, there's no attempt to paint their words to make them more appealing, and I can respect that. I can respect the show is made in lightning fast time in both writing and productions. I can respect their willingness to tackle subject matter that larger scale productions wouldn't go near with a 40 foot pole. Unfortunately I don't enjoy or get anything from South Park that I'm happy about. Each subsequent season of South Park left me feeling a greater ratio of sadness, anger, and frustration than humor or laughter. At the end of the day, South Park is about looking into the unflushed toilet that is society and meticulously pulling apart the leavings floating in the bowl for no other reason than to see what the leavings are made of and what makes them smell as bad as they do. I can't ding the show for this because that's exactly what it sets out for, and it's exactly what it accomplishes. Do with that what you will.","7","4 June 2021"
"9","South Park is a great cartoon, even with it's occasional pitfalls every season. It combines satire, music and comedy to create a terrific masterpiece of an animated show. Trey Parker and Matt Stone bring the weekly antics of a inbred mountain town in a way that has never been done before and it is drop dead funny. Sometimes it seems like the seasons get better, sometimes they seem to get worse for some. But episodes like ""Chinpokomon"", ""The Passion of the Jew"", ""Tolerance Camp"", and ""Clubhouse"" are classics. And most episodes get funnier every single time I see it and thanks to Comedy Central giving Parker and Stone full control for language, nothing is out of bounds.","10","19 February 2000"
"10","Matt and Trey need to be commended for this series.  It takes shots at EVERYTHING, and it does it in really questionable taste.  But that's why I love it.  Because, beneath the crude language and vulgar humor, South Park contains one of most biting satires in existence.  This show is hilarious, constantly taking current events, such as Stem Cell Research, or fads, like the infamous Poke'mon craze, and spinning their own view on them.  Thank you, Matt Stone and Trey Parker.  Thank you.BOTTOM LINE:  One show I try to never miss on Wednesdays.  This series gives me something to look for.",NA,"24 October 2003"
"11","For some reason I stopped following this show long time ago, even before tenth season I think. Recently, again for some inexplicable reason, it came to my mind and I decided to start it all over, from season one, but this time I'm gonna finish it, or better to say catch it, because I hope it will never end. This morning I finished first season. There's nothing better than healthy laughter with morning coffee. After 20 years this season is still fresh and hilarious. One of the strongest tens I ever gave.10/10""There is actually a lot of intelligent social commentary here - it's just masked under anything they could possibly offend someone with."" - chthon2","10","16 October 2017"
"12","This cartoon series has a very outrageous style of humour that can put some people off, especially the very offensive character Cartman. Yet it is often done in the service of satire that mostly hits the mark. The plots are also very outrageous though I think they ran out of original ideas as the years went on and just started to parody themselves and popular culture like Family Guy.","10","20 August 2020"
"13","This is the show about the four foul mouthed little kids in Colorado.  Well, three now, with different kids rotating in and out to fill the spot that Kenny left.Matt Stone and Trey Parker are comedic geniuses.  I think that people who simply brush this off as uninspired pandering to foul mouthed kids like the ones in this show aren't looking deep enough.  There is actually a lot of intelligent social commentary here - it's just masked under anything they could possibly offend someone with.",NA,"20 May 2003"
"14","This show always makes me laugh. I've been watching for almost my entire life....it was basically my childhood! This show has always been my favorite adult cartoon, and maybe even one of my all time favorite cartoons! All of the characters are likable in some way. This show was also a miracle for adult cartoons' reputation, along with Rick and Morty. While I feel like Family Guy isn't doing so well in its later seasons, along with the Simpsons, and American Dad has quite a couple of duds, I feel like South Park really stands out. South Park is also a very creative show. It has an art style that I've never seen before in a show. Also, it has such controversial jokes and plots that many adult shows wouldn't DARE to step into. If you enjoy controversial humor and hilarious shows, I'd highly recommend South Park. :)","10","29 March 2016"
"15","I remember back when ""South Park"" first came out and I thought to myself it was an awful show if only because of the animation. This is definitely something that's grown on me. Many people chastise this show for being mean spirited, but it honestly isn't. I love the episodes where they say that if you're a genuinely good person, it doesn't matter what your (religious) beliefs are. The important thing is to do the right thing and that's something my family always taught me. Contrast this with something like ""Family Guy"" where they say you're an idiot if you believe in God. Trey Parker said that of all the ridiculous things religion teaches, atheism is even worse as it teaches that things happen for no reason. This is a wonderfully original and insightful idea.It's weird how people can support other shows like Bill Maher. He outright says you're a bad person because of what you think. In this show, it simply says to live your life the way you want because your ideals work for you. Maybe religion will die, but the spirit of love will always live on. While you may argue that ""South Park"" does not have a consistent ideology, you could say the same for the Nostalgia Critic. I'm certain you'll be offended by at least one thing they say. Controversial jokes work great if they're done well. They need to be done with no real spite like this show does. Yes, the show is quite obscene, but it definitely makes you think more than most shows.It's hard to find a cartoon that is so topical. All you really have to do is just look at the world around you and imagine what the next episode of ""South Park"" will say about it. This is a great example of how pop culture reflects everyday life. The show used to be known for Kenny dying in every episode, but now rarely does it at all. This show has in fact changed for the better and it does treat the viewers with respect. My favorite character would have to be Butters. It's probably because he's the only kid who doesn't swear and he reminds me of how I was in the exact same position as a kid.Should kids watch this? No. We spend most of our lives as adults so we'll have a lot more time to watch shows like this. It's great that the show is developing more and more of an ongoing storyline. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are great people who want you to accept who you truly are. This show is a great source of entertainment, but might be hard to follow politically. It's nice how they make fun of everyone who exists, but don't resent them. If you think that characters like Cartman are supposed to be loved, you're missing the point. Cartman exists for the role of showing the creators' frustrations towards true bigots. It seems like you're missing out on a lot by rejecting this show, but that's fine. I personally find this to be the funniest and most relevant cartoon ever made. It's certainly dark, but lacks true malice. I do think it's important to make jokes that are relevant to a story, because it's just better written. I'm glad this show has gone on so long. ****","10","14 September 2016"
"16","The title of my review says it all. This show had great stories for over a decade and then they decided to get all silly and try to have a story arc every year. I have trouble watching an entire new episode now.","8","17 March 2019"
"17","Stan. Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, are the funniest thing to ever come out of Comedy Central thus far, and I have a feeling that will remain true in the future as well. ""South Park"" is hilarious, thought-provoking sure, but mostly hilarious in it's profanity and outrages situations. From time to time it seems to ruffle the feathers of the ultra-thin skinned PC crowd due to the Libetarian philosophy that pervades in most of the episodes, but they're huge p%&sies anyway. Sure this had a few lame episodes, but never in a row of four and never enough to make a whole season not worth watching (yet the 8th season WAS trying at times). But overall it's a great show, and if Matt Stone & Trey Parker are able to keep the pace up for another year of great episodes then it'll have a better run than the Simpsons, in my mind, that had stopped being good at around Season 9 or 10 (I don't really see the first 2 seasons of that show being that great either, so that's 7 seasons of Simpson's genius hilarity against about 8 of South Park that were great) My Grade: A+","10","29 October 2005"
"18","South Park is HILARIOUS!It is very much a satire, but it being animated gives the creators and writers freedom to do practically whatever they want, and there are NO restrictions in this show. The story lines are constantly funny and amusing, and always entertaining. This is a better show and satire than The Simpsons and Family Guy, and hopefully it continues to bring more episodes for a long time. Also, the way that time never really moves or the boys age is part of what gives it freedom to do whatever it wants. This is a show not afraid to make fun of ANYTHING and not afraid to do whatever it can to make us laugh.",NA,"3 May 2011"
"19","Now listen, i'm giving this show a 9 because the previous seasons before season 19 were excellent. They really influenced many other hilarious shows, and part of the fun of my childhood was tuning in to South Park when my parents were gone, only to be caught watching it. But the thing that keeps me from giving this show a perfect 10 is because i think the show has changed for the worst.So like i said first 18 seasons of South Park we're excellent, even the bad episodes in there still had great memorable moments. I tuned in to Season 19 and i noticed they wanted to do a story season were everything is connected. But that season provided little laughs and the finale was disappointing. I had high hopes for Season 20 because i thought Trey and Matt (the show's creators) had listened to the feedback on Season 19, but Season 20 was even worse then the last one. Many characters went through unnecessary changes, they put so much political topics into the show to the point where it felt like overkill, they managed to make Gerald (Kyle's dad) the most unlikable character in the show, many things that the show sets up are quickly forgotten, and the ending was bad (not disappointing like season 19, but just bad). Season 21 was an improvement from Season 20 but the show was still missing something. And i think i know what killed South Park.It's no secret that South Park has many political and social commentary tones, but that was never the main point of the show, that was just a good addition to it. But it's like Matt and Trey forgot that, and they made the social commentary the MAIN point of the show.The sad thing about it is Trey and Matt really want to go back to the roots of South Park, but they forgot how to. They got so carried away with Politics that they forgot that the heart of the show was 4 foul mouthed kids in a small mountain town that find themselves in the dumbest of situations. They completely ditched that part of the show and i eagerly want it back.","9","16 December 2018"

South Park is gold because it pushes the limits in every episode.
South Park can be political but its done right.Each and every character past, present, dead, alive, young and old are funny and memorable.Stan is the sarcastic, don't give a S*** while remaining calm kind of a boy.Kyle is the moral compass of the 4 boys but that doesn't make him into a p****. His Cartman's hatred after 24 years is still fresh and fun.Kenny is kind of just there to die, do complicated tasks and for poor people jokes. As Mysterion he is a totally different character.Cartman is the face of South Park. His immature, psychotic, antisocial behaviour is what makes the show so special. Without him then South Park would be no more.My favorite outside the 4 boys is Mr. Garrison. He is like Cartman but in grown up form. He is a gay character done right.I wish to know and see more Clyde, Token and Craig.Honorable mention to the Late Chef, he was the moral compass for the children when they were down and out and ll other grown ups shunned them instead of helping them.
Another honorable mention to Butters who is a naive, passive wimp who gets grounded from almost anything. Cartman uses and abuses him as much as Butter's own parents does.
Butters doesn't learn after 24 years. He falls for the same tricks over and over.Each and every episode including Pip episode and Towlie Ep are memorable and iCONIC.South Park also does a great job producing songs. Many of their songs are catchy and purely fantastic to listen to.Over the years, either the network, or other countries and religious fanatics have censored South Park Episodes.
Its like you are on a playground and someone who you aren't talking to, starts insulting a sports team. You overhear it and want to censor them even though you can just walk away. That's what South Park has dealt with for over 24 years. Many people get triggered over a show that they can just not watch.
Verdict: South Park was just a perfect, fabulous, funny Gold show. I've binged South Park for years. It remains funny each time.","10","23 October 2020"

"25","When ""South Park"" first came out I ignored it and thought it was another passing fad for young kids. I never gave it a chance. I figured it was crude for the sake of being crude and didn't watch more than five minutes of an episode.Then I saw the movie, which I thought was just about one of the funniest things ever. ""Uncle F***a"" had me in tears. ""Bigger Longer & Uncut"" is one of the most consistently funny films I've ever seen, and even as a musical/animation it worked very well.So I gave the TV show another chance. I fell in love with it. I watch it much more now. Sure, it is very crude, sometimes a bit too much so. It's immature and juvenile. But it's also very clever.Trey and Matt get away with loads of stuff other people could never get away with on TV. I don't know how they keep pushing the boundaries. One episode of ""South Park"" had so much swearing, a profanity was outlawed from public television ""indefinitely."" Sometimes the gags are kind of lame because they are so juvenile, but for the most part it's really funny. Matt and Trey basically do all the voices including celebrity impersonations.I think this is a really clever, really self-satirical show that's sorely needed during times as restrictive as these. With ""South Park"" pushing the boundaries on public TV we can all sleep safely at night knowing our nation's level of tolerance is in good hands.","10","18 August 2005"
"26","South Park Is the best TV show on Planet Earth. I actually think it's better than Rick and Morty. But, does it deserve a 10? 
When people who only watch Rick and Morty hear South Park, they think it's a very lazy and crude show (I will be ripping my friends' love for Rick and Morty to shreds). South park is actually the opposite, it is intelligent, funny and in some places heart warming and sad.
The characters are perfect, I love Cartman, Kenny, Stan, Butters, Randy and my personal favourite Kyle. The supporting cast are some of the most memorable characters, not as good as The Simpsons.
The episodes are some of the most memorable scenarios ever put on television. Hilarious episodes like the zip lining episode, unexpected episodes like the Christmas Critters episode, episodes exploiting people opinions and views on the world like ""Chinpokemon"" and ""Passion of the Jew"", very emotional episodes like ""You're getting old"" and my personal favourite episode ""Raisins"", very dark episodes like ""Scott Tenerman must die"" and the very important ""Osama Bin Laden has Farty Pants"". There's such a variety than Peter Griffin doing something stupid or a wacky Sci-Fi adventure with Rick and Morty.
The show has fallen. It's now a very boring show. But, instead of looking at the present, we have seasons 1-17 to rewatch. I have many respects to Stone and Parker for giving us a show that even my mother can love.","10","28 August 2018"
"27","I started watching this show a couple of years ago. The first episode I watched had the ""Timmy"" character as the main star (?). Of course - I immediately thought to myself, ""Is there no shame<U+0085>is there?"" I was also - laughing so hard, I could not stop crying. This is a show for those who have no political allegiance and were born with that rarest of attributes<U+0085>thick skin. If you like this kind of humor (and I do) the laughs are non-stop, cutting edge and always outrageous. If you are offended easily, watch something else. Maybe a show like 'Friends' is right up your alley. You will hear the same overly-clichéd and acceptable hard-left jabs at conservatives, which are all reinforced by the tiring sounds of obvious laugh-tracks. These guys (on South Park<U+0085>not Friends) are no one's lapdog. They dig at everyone and anything. Nobody is holier-than-thou and everyone wears a comedic target on their back. Because of this approach, I feel the show is more honest about its humor (much like, 'Saturday Night Live', was in the '70s), where nothing is sacred and nothing is expected. The big difference is that you don't have to wait the entire show for a laugh. The writers are not a bunch of Suzy-suck-ups and write on strictly impulse<U+0085>now that is courage. Additionally, I think each one their little animated characters are destined to become cult-heroes<U+0085>or not. Fun show and thanks for the laughs. I cannot wait to see the spin these guys put on 'The 2014 Sochi – Olympics.""","10","12 February 2014"
"28","I read in complete disbelief the comments that called the show racist, homophobic, anti-religious and even one that said it promoted animal cruelty. LOL! There isn't a single race, religion, political group, sexuality, gender, nationality, celebrity etc etc that it doesn't make fun of. The show even pops fun at itself in some episodes, signalling to the world that they themselves are open to ridicule. If you think the show has a nasty message about a certain group then your just not getting it and i'm glad you have ceased watching and have moved on to more brain numbing programmes that don't cause you to think (might I recommend 'Friends').","10","20 February 2010"
"29","This is probably the second or third greatest cartoon ever made, after The Simpsons of course. It's also one of the best adult cartoons. Filled with swearing, violence, weird and wonderful (sometimes nasty) stories, this is a great show. The show revolves around four eight-year-old kids who live in the mountain town of South Park, Colorado. They are the sensible Stan Marsh, the sensible Jewish Kyle Broslofski, the shy, easily amused and clever Kenny McCormick, and of course, the fat, horrible, violent, ignorant and offensive, but lovable bastard character I know, not just on the show but probably on TV, Eric Cartman. Every episode they have the same kind of formula, the kids try to do something, Cartman is stupid and horrible, the towns people are stupid, and Kenny dies. There are other good characters including the slutty Mrs Cartman, the disgusting homosexual Mr. Garrison, the sociable Mr. Mackey (always says Mmmkay), Big Gay Al, the festive Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo (yikes), Terrance and Phillip, Wendy, Butters, Tweek, Timmy, Officer Barbrady, Jesus, Satan, Saddam Hussein, Tom the News Reporter and many more. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone do almost all voices, along with Mary Kay Bergman (till her suicide) and Mona Marshall, and singer Isaac Hayes as Chef, guests have included: Sir Elton John, Meat Loaf, Ozzy Osbourne, Jennifer Aniston and a couple of others. But when they did have most celebrities, creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker voiced them their selves. This is just the best adult cartoon I know, and when they end it, I hope Cartman pays for everything he's done. Winner of and nominated for numerous awards including 6 Emmy nominations (one of them won)! Eric Cartman was number 5 on Top Ten TV Bastards, Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments, and along with the film, it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!","10","9 May 2005"
"30","This is one of the wittiest television series. Characters are perfect. Voice for characters is so nice that it could not have been better. Eric Cartman bring totally unimaginable, humorous ideas. Butters, Stan, Kenny, Iyke all help bringing up taste to stories. I just love how they make fun of famous celebrities, TV series, movies etc. People might have issues with some of the stories and language used throughout, but if you like comedy with satire and some adult references you would enjoy this series.I liked the episode based on Warcraft game(season 10,episode 8), if you are going to start watching it you can start with this episode.Big applause for Trey Parker and Matt Stone the creators of South Park. They also have voiced many characters in the series.","10","11 December 2013"
"31","During the last few years, ""South Park"" has become a well ingrained part of our culture. Focusing on the (mis)adventures of foul-mouthed schoolchildren Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny (who gets killed a lot), the show makes fun of everyone and everything. Whether it's Jesus hosting his own talk show, a blow-up Antonio Banderas doll, PETA members breeding with animals, Sally Struthers looking like Jabba the Hut, or a succubus trying to steal the chef, this show has something to offend everyone. To crown everything, Kyle's mother is the archetypal meddlesome Jewish mother. Best of all was the 1999 movie ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut""; they were allowed to say all sorts of things that you can't say on TV. Either way, you just gotta see this show whenever possible. You'll either love it or hate it (I love it).",NA,"2 July 2005"
"32","Stone and Parker are brilliant maniacs, and they proof it during every season of South Park. Forget the lame animation, it's the writing that propels this show. Garbage like Family guy tries to be funny, South Park probably throws away jokes that show would love to have. No one gets a break. The rich, the poor, the right, the left, and so on. It's always topical and for the most, gut busting funny. Just a brilliant and funny show that rarely falls on it's face. Just a great show. Unless one is a PC fool, then just don't watch it.","9","5 July 2018"
"33","I've watched many shows with a good sense of comedy such as Family Guy, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Archer, but they can't compete with this show. After years of watching shows, South Park is now my all time favorite show, out of all these shows, no show has ever shown more creativity and comedy than South Park. I find this show the best show ever. People have downgraded this show a little because of political controversy and excessive vulgarity. But not me, no I see this show for what it really is, A show that can be extremely explicit and unbelievably funny with many episodes focusing on the topic of failed experiments, and political conflict.10/10Best Show Ever!","10","1 January 2013"
"34","So a few episodes have a bigger logic hole than the ozone hole, but that doesn't matter because the series is a terrific parody of everything that goes wrong in the US.","10","31 March 2021"
"35","This is another one of my favorite shows of all time. I remember seeing this show when I was about in my Soft more year in High School, this show really made my school days a little more cheerful. It was also a phenomenon, there were toys, graphic tees with some of the quotes from the show, but also a pinball game which was cool along with the digital tables from Zen Pinball, as well as video games most notably the two RPGs ""The Stick of Truth"" and ""The Fractured but Whole"" which as Cartman would put it kick ass. There really wasn't an animated show like this let alone many that were aimed for the teen and adult demographic, to me that's part of what made the show special showing that you can do much more with the animation genre. It is the perfect area for comedy because in animation you really have the freedom to push the boundaries in comedy and accomplish things that live action wouldn't be able to do. The animation style is great, it's a unique one because of it's simplistic nature which to me add to the comedy. As the back ground and characters look like they were made from cut out and pasted construction paper. This to me give the show a surrealist and comical feel of a world that is out of sorts. Though it sort of gives the show a twisted story book feel only this book is one that's for teens and adults.I really like how South Park is constructed its sort of a Alternate America flipped completely upside down. It's not a place I'd want to live in, nor am I sure I'd visit as there is so much lunacy and death even more than Tromaville in ""The Toxic Avenger"" movies. Though the town is also kind of a fantasy world as there is something some really unreal crazy crap that happens and shows up from dragons, demons, evil psychics, evil magicians, zombies, aliens the list goes on, you just have to see it to believe it. This also adds to the comedy, because you feel that in this world anything is possible and anything that can happen will.The dialog is just fantastic, this show has some of the best verbal humor I've ever heard. There are a lot of memorable lines enough to sell Graphic Tees for years. It's really crude and colorful with the amount of profanity but also really clever at the same time. Even the writing is fantastic as there are episodes that satire and parody on certain topical social issues, really shines a dark cracked mirror showing how ridiculous and out of control these issues really are. Though to me the ones I really like are the original storylines from the single episodes like ""Woodland Critter Christmas"" and ""Good Times with Weapons"" but also two or three parter arc, the three parter arcs to me are the best because they are the most epic and just get funnier the further it gets, but most importantly keep their eye on the ball and pay off which most long arc in TV shows sometimes fail to do. The three arcs I love are ""Imagination Land which is an animation fans dream come true, The comic book heroes where the characters are parodies on DC and Marvel superheroes, and of course ""Console Wars"" which is a parody on ""Game of Thrones"".The show is also kind of a musical, this show has so many memorable songs that I love to download on my iPod and listen to or even play at a party or certain holiday's if possible. Three of my favorites are ""Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo which is sort of a parody on the Frosty the Snowman song"", ""Let's fighting Love"" which is just hilarious anime music parody as it consists of random sentences some in English and some plain gibberish, ""Kyle's Mom"" that is just a laugh riot it's just Cartman's ranting at it's best and most disrespectful peak., though believe or not my favorite song is ""Sun Valley"" from Stan and Wendy yeah it's a love song but it's one of my favorite because it's cute, sweet, funny, and beautiful as it perfectly expresses the relationship between both characters. And of course, there is the Theme song which is one of my favorite theme songs of all time, it's a very strange but funny tone which is hard to describe you have to hear it for yourself, but it perfectly fits the nature of the show.Though to me what really makes the show are the characters, their all great from the supporting characters but most of all the main ensemble Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny whom are to me the real heart of the show. I'll just state a couple of the supporting characters that are my favorites and there are lots of them but these two always stood the most in my mind.I even like how there seems to be a bit of a contrast to most of the adults and kids in South Park. Despite older there are none the wiser as if their I.Q. points have dropped over the years or are just kind of lazy; alright Chef is probably one of the only adults in the show that actually has smarts. It's just funny how at times Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, Wendy and any other company with them are actually smarter and more mature, to me in a way their the real adults in the show.Chef voiced by the late great Isaac Hayes one of my favorite singer's and a solid actor, this character is just fantastic. To me in a way he's sort of the South Park's kids father they never had. He's no doubt a better mentor than every other teacher in the school as he has more common sense. Though he's a bit oversexed or obsessed with it as he constantly sings a lot of songs about lovemaking to a woman sometimes at the most inappropriate times and in front of the South Park kids, those songs are both fun and funny as their a slight parody on Isaac.Wendy Testinburger I just love her character. She is so sweet, smart and a strong aggressive person as she's not afraid to commit and fight for good causes which she actually does win.It's really funny when we see she has a bit of a dark side to sometimes, usual when there is something that really pushes her over the edge she becomes sort of ruthless and scary where she will literally destroy anyone that crosses her. But most of all like that she doesn't take crap from anyone especially Cartman whom hates her (no surprise since he hates about everybody in the entire world) she actually stands up for herself. So, she's pretty much sugar and spice which I think is a good combination.However, what I really love is the relationship between both Stan and Wendy, these two are one of my favorite fictional couples these two just have the sweetest and beautiful chemistry I've seen and I found it a light in a town full of darkness. Despite their age it feels like a real relationship as they have their ups and downs who doesn't but they both work though them. We even see both of them do their best to make the other happy. It's true that it's not all physical due to one fault where Stan is plagued by love sickness as he always upchucks when Wendy tries to kiss Stan or get's too close, it sort of like that same dilemma with Rogue and Gambit on X-Men. However despite that problem both work around that by mentally and emotionally connecting which to me makes the connection even stronger than the physical touch. Now we get to the South Park kids: Kenny: This is an interesting character not just from the fact that he is cursed with dying. But he's the non-verbal character, well ok he does communicate but he voice is always muffled, how any of the other kids can understand him is anyone's guess. His character is just a living mystique with that hood that covers his hole face except he eyes, he's full of surprises as he really does get out of his way to save others, certain alter egos he takes on like Mysterion whom is a parody on ""Batman"" and the other Princess Kenny whom is a parody on Danarey's from ""Game of Thrones"" why the hell he wanted to dress up as a princess is anyone's guess, the list goes on.Kyle: He's sort of like Stan but unlike Stan he's more on the aggressive and impulsive side. I like that he's not afraid to do what he seeks out to do and say what he has to say. But he's also not afraid to stand up to opposition and not take crap from anyone especially Cartman whom everyday gives him crap.Stan: This character is another one of my favorite fictional protagonists. I find his character relatable because he is the most human and level headed of the bunch. I really like how he reacts to everything that happens around him and his views on things, it feels like that's how I would react if I was in the same circumstances. He sort of has that look and reaction that says, ""Are you fraking crazy"" or ""Could you be this stupid."". But to me what makes him a hero (sort of) is he somewhat a voice of common sense. He's able to think for himself and not just go along with whatever comes his way, when he knows who the captain of the ship is and is steering off course Stan knows to abandon ship. He does care about other people willing to do the right thing whether he wants to or not because no one else can or has the balls to.Cartman: Ah, man he's my favorite character in the show. He's a villain but he's the kind you just love to hate. This guy despite being the maestro of foul mouth he just has some of the best lines ever. He's the living definition of spoiled rotten, a zeal of selfishness and self- absorption, and has bigotry which is as big as his body. Cartman is ruthless in getting whatever he wants in the worst way possible, anyone and anything that gets in the way he'll blow away.
 It's always funny as everything just backfires on him mainly due to self betrayal from his own petty desires.If your looking for laughs, South Park is the place to be.Rating: 4 stars","10","3 June 2018"
"36","How creative are the makers of this show,making over 200 episodes, with each one (except the famous episode-Scott Tenorman must die) featuring at least two plots, each plot being somehow inexplicably and bizarrely linked to the other? Whether it was More Crap (the episode in which Bono got ripped) or Insheeption (the parody on Inception), the makers have an amazing talent of starting a story in one direction, completely veering it on its head and then proceeding, while adding further, random elements to it, all adding to the chaotic but somehow congruous final product. Southpark isn't about the witty one-liners or sarcasm that Friends was built on. It's a delightful mix of completely unsubtle and in-your-face profanity and vulgarity with satirical humor dispensed both openly and cryptically. It's bottom line is to rip on everything and everyone,from businessmen to environmentalists,from politicians to activists, no one is spared. It routinely blows normal situations to ridiculous and comical proportions and the makers set no boundaries for in this show, absolutely anything can happen. And its funny. It brings up normal everyday things, and shows us the funny side. It hardly ever takes one side, but rips on both of them. This is one of the most intelligent shows out there. It's a slap in the face of the overtly-sensitive, the conservative and the insensitive and the liberal at the same time. It's a satire. It's gross and graphic. It has no boundaries. It's racist and insensitive, but in a light manner. It's controversial and contemporary. Bottom line-It's one of the best TV shows of all time.","9","14 December 2010"

"39","Let's just go ahead and say it...South Park is the greatest comedy show in television history! Most people don't know what to make of this show. Most see a cartoon, hear kids speaking bad language...then get completely confused because most episodes actually include a coherent plot and a moral message. Because of this, the show has morphed into one of those shows where people absolutely love it -- or terribly hate it. Count me in as one of the ones who absolutely love it...this is my favorite comedy TV show. And my favorite 1/2 hour TV show. And my favorite Animated TV show! What gives ""South Park"" big points from me is actually how unique it is. Some would scoff at that comment, but seriously...name me one other show where Elementary school kids talk like they really do (dirty!). One where people shove food up their anuses and excrete it orally (haaa!). The day I see another TV show talk about the size of one's crap (and arguing whether or not it is a record) is the day I'll consider South Park typical! :) The seasons get better and better as they go...so if you haven't seen an episode yet, I suggest the newer ones. The first couple seasons seem terribly dated when watching them today. But the newer ones are fresh and very original.Along with ""Real Time With Bill Maher"", ""South Park"" is the best show on TV!

"40","It's good to see that South Park is still going after it debuted on TV in 1997. From there, TV would never be the same again. Year after year South Park has always pushed the boundaries with political correctness, with no topic or group of people spared. With that South Park is certainly no stranger to controversy, with many parent groups in an uproar over its subject matter, as well as various religious groups protesting their disapproval of the show. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have never backed down nor tiptoed around the controversy.I watched the first several seasons religiously when it first aired in 1997 however since then I did lose interest in the show. Just recently I have started watching the show again out of curiosity and I found myself laughing which renewed my interest in South Park. Sure the toilet humour and sex related jokes go too far sometimes, but there is no denying that South Park is still the funniest show still on air and unlike other shows has not been showing any signs of running out of steam any time soon.10/10.","10","12 March 2015"

"42","At first I thought, ""this show is completely crude and has no purpose."" Recently I started watching South Park again because of it's comedic interpretation of modern day culture. One of my favourite episodes was when the Internet broke down for the entire world, and how it crippled society.South Park is about four boys: Stan, Kyle, Eric and Kenny who started out in 3rd grade and then went to 4th grade. Stan and Kyle's friendship is based on creators Parker and Stone's friendship in real life. The setting is the town of South Park. Stan is the everyman of this group of boys and Kyle is more of a loner. Even though the characters are fictional, Stan reflects Parker and Kyle - Stone. Eric is the loud, racist, obnoxious one and Kenny who had poor origins is a little disturbed and wears his hood on his parka too tight.South Park has covered such issues as poverty, aids, adoption, greed, government, racism, Thanksgiving, Christmas, religion, war..you name it, South Park has covered it in a comedic yet thoughtful way. I was wrong, the show isn't completely crude and is worth watching. - Asif Zamir","10","3 December 2013"

This show actually tackles real and very dark real life problems covered and hidden behind all the comedy that's emphasized. Political, religious debates are thrown in this show, as well as environmental issues and the way society is throughout the late 90s up to now. If you haven't seen this show...just watch it.

Moreover, South Park is a microcosm of the world.Wonderfully funny, satirical, irreverent and subversive. Screamingly funny at times. No subject is too taboo or sacred (well, almost no subject...) for the searing wit of creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Covers many topical, and often controversial, subjects with no holds barred.Only problem is that, in taking aim at everything, Parker and Stone sometimes leave mixed messages. Hard to figure where they stand on something, sometimes. This issue is more prevalent in the later seasons.","9","16 October 2018"

"50","Who knew that Trey Parker and Matt Stone's silly and offensive experiment would one day blossom into the most biting and undeniably hilarious satire on television? For those with the stomach for the sometimes obscene nature of this show, the rewards are endless. This show has depicted such spot-on comic depictions of topical social issues that it's almost difficult to watch. Almost. This show is an essential part of a complete comedy diet and a perfect example of humor as a tool for change, a torch to make light of difficult subjects, bringing otherwise untouchable topics into focus. This show is brave, intelligent, and delightfully dark, and it cannot be praised enough. How the writers have kept it so funny for so long, how they've made it better and better with each year, is a marvel.","10","28 October 2019"
"51","While many of the TV haters think of south park of a inappropriate immature show that is all about how vulgar and explicit we can be or how gross and how many fart jokes we can make which in that case they mistaken this show with family guy. Instead of the funniest and best written adult animated TV. Which is all about how kids act naturally aka when there is no adults around and if you ever been to a public school now a days it is way to accurate. South park also usually has its own message at the end For example It hits the fan a episode many people thought was just how many times can we use the s word uncensored on TV, but were wrong when the whole message of that episode was why are certain words different and offend people when other words don't and a very good point why is OK for TV dramas to curse and say curse words when a animated show wants to everyone flips out shown in this episode which features the s word 182 times.","10","16 August 2014"
"52","I'm going to break with tradition here and pen a love letter. ""South Park"", which I absolutely worship, is the funniest show currently on TV, and right up there with the funniest things ever made for the big screen or the small screen. The key to all things funny is the writing, and the writing for ""South Park"" is incredible. Parker and Stone have also created a character, Cartman, who is right up there with all-time TV favorites such as Thurston Howell The Third (""Gilligan's Island""), Doctor Smith (""Lost in Space"") and George Costanza (""Seinfeld""). They've also created ""Jimmy"", one of the funniest, most three-dimensional screen retards ever, ""Timmy"", another hilarious retard, ""Mr. Garrison"", ""Mr. Hanky"", ""Mr. Hat"", ""Kenny"", the list is endless. You also have to bow to any show that features a character such as ""Towelie"", a truly pathetic piece of talking cloth. There are a few misses amongst the hits, but what would you expect? The guys are human. And they're permitted their indulgences since it is THEIR show, goddammit!!! For a movie and TV lover such as myself, the non-stop media referencing strikes a chord every time and Parker/Stone's ability to crank out shows that address totally current issues deserves massive respect. Favorite eps? Too many to list here, and who the f. cares, anyway. Let's just say that ""South Park"" is one of the most intelligent, perceptive, brilliant pieces of pop culture you are ever likely to see. And everything you need to know about life can be found within its humble frames. Respect the authorataaahhhh of this classic show!","10","19 November 2006"
"53","South Park is the best show on earth. So what if the show teases you if you're an Asian. It's supposed to be a joke. Can you take a joke? ""Def Comedy Jam"" tease us white people, and I don't get so upset about it. This show is very funny. Give it a chance. Kenny doesn't die all the time. He didn't get killed in the Christmas Special with Mr. Hankey. Maybe you didn't watch the show enough.",NA,"31 December 1998"
"54","What can I say about this show? Just the insane attention to detail, the genius layering of social satire. You can watch it a million times and it still wouldn't get old. Matt and Trey take a bow and thank you for working so hard to create one of the iconic shows of all time. Truly a gift from God.","10","3 August 2021"
"55","This is-by miles, leaps and bounds-the funniest show I have ever seen. This is coming from someone who watches the simpsons, family guy, drawn together, robot chicken, chappelle's show, and mind of mencia on a regular basis. How Matt Parker and Trey Stone come up with this stuff is amazing. The stuttering kid Jimmy is alone enough reason to watch this outstanding show, and I don't think I need to tell you about the infamous Cartman. Watch this show whenever it is on- it is arguably the funniest show on TV today. Now that chappelle's show is defunct (temporarily) South Park is king of all comedy central shows. Nine years and STILL going strong. I hope it keeps it up until 2009, which is when I've heard it will end. But hopefully, it won't end even then.10/10. Freakin hilarious.","10","27 January 2006"
"56","Without fail South Park continues to provide an intellectually insightful view into modern society. There may be many moments of disgust mixed in with humour but every episode I find myself learning something. How odd is it that you can say you learn't something from South Park. Some people may find what they portray offensive but it is all relatively truthful and soundly researched. I find myself thinking that everything they do is based on common sense and I appreciate that they believe in equality when it comes to calling out idiotic behaviour.If you don't give South Park a proper chance you will never understand the genius behind it or if you cannot get over your righteous beliefs to look at the world objectively then you will remain disgusted with the so-called decline in popular culture. Stop judging and allow it to be what it is...A show that calls it as it is.","9","23 February 2014"
"57","OK, so it's a bunch of badly animated cartoon characters most cursing, fighting, delivering toilet humor and offending just about everyone. Regardless, I like this show. If you don't get offended by everything and can just enjoy yourself every once in a while and take a joke, you could too. The humor is toilet humor (no pun intended about Mr. Hankey, who I don't think is funny), but it's very funny and makes fun of certain issues that really do need to be made fun of. I really find the stereotypes spread throughout this show too (fat kid, Jewish kid, British kid, black starving kid from Sally Struthers commercials, etc) because I think they're funny. This isn't my usual type of humor, though, and I do perfer good sketch, improv or standup comedy, but this is a very clever and fun show.",NA,"23 February 2000"
"58","In the beginning,I was not a big fan of South Park: I thought the cartoon had too many cursed words and I could not understand very much the critics that the cartoon is all about; I was 11 years old when South Park started to be exhibited, So I don't blame myself for that. But the years passed, and now I am 19 and since I am 16 I started to enjoy South Park very much. Even if you don't agree with some episodes, you cannot say that this TV series is not funny; It's totally political incorrect, but that is what makes it so great. I even bought a Kenny doll for myself!!Other interesting thing to notice is that the cartoons have a very bad quality, that also makes the Series be funnier, different from many other cartoon who would certainly be massive criticized.",NA,"26 December 2005"
"59","I can not count the amount of times I watched this series and watched it again and again. South park is shows that holds nothing back and gives you some of the most surprising and iconic moments in television. There is not a episode that you will not laugh until your stomach hurts. Everyone reading this needs to stop and go watch south park and the best thing is that it's free on there official website so what are you doing, go and watch this iconic staple of entertainment history.","10","11 October 2019"
"60","The fact south park has managed to stay on the air after all the grief they have gotten over the years shows how great it really is.Constantly keeping up to date, always being funny, reinventing the format, characters you care about (everyone has a favourite) and brilliant stories make this my joint favourite cartoon (tied with Futurama) of all time.The Simpsons really went off a cliff in the last 10 or so years, but I think south park has stayed strong pretty much every season, even my least favourite season has classic episodes in it.If you're reading reviews to see if you should start watching; you really should. Stick with it as it starts to hit it's stride and look better after a couple of seasons.And if you haven't seen the film, that is a must see!","10","23 December 2021"
"61","Great fun and hilarious until season 21. Once they started dedicating entire seasons to one topic or plot it kind of started to go downhill to me. Gonna give season 25 a chance.","1","10 February 2022"
"62","Shows become a convoluted mess that relies on it's own weak lore and tired old tropes and (mostly) recycled theme's with a fraction of the substance of the first 5 seasons.I used to love South Park so much. It's no good any mroe. Rightfully, they should have ended the show with their split from Isaac Hayes, and especially when Matt stone and Trey Parker stopped writing together.They've proven that they can both do great things and be successful outside of this show, but my only theory as to why it's still on is that it makes too much damn money and C.C vmade them too good of a deal to offer to stop producing it, there's no love in it anymore and if anything, I feel like I'm being Audience Abused when I watch it nowadays.","3","19 March 2021"

"64","""South Park "" is one of the best cartoons ever made . I know that for many people find it vulgar and offensive ,but if you dare to look closer there are many solid points in many chapters . And not only that ,many of the jokes are hilarious and clever and not all the show it's about cursing all the time . Certainly isn't a show for children ,but it have very much to offer . The use of the absurdity and the grotesque as satire works very well , daring to be shocking and effective . The animation it's very simple ,but the characters are very expressive and occasionally there are other references to other styles of animation . ""South Park "" have many funny and memorable moments , and even those jokes that were shocking still made me laugh a lot . I wouldn't recommend this show to the people who is easily offended ,but to all who want a hilarious and original show .","10","8 February 2007"
"65","South Park is the best. I love everything about it. The hilarious characters, the good animation, the excellent humor, and anything else about it that I haven't mentioned. Hence my name, you can tell I am a big fan of this show. I love all the episodes, especially the Imaginationland trilogy, made into a made for TV movie basically. The show is without a doubt one of my favorites, and I really don't care who knows it or not. South Park is great. The only episodes I really hated were ""Stanley's Cup"" and ""Major Boobage"", but the rest of the series is pure gold.10/10","10","26 March 2009"
"66","Though the earlier shows were very good and entertaining, their more recent shows tend to be repetitive. The last tended to pertain mostly to pot culture, which was disappointing. However, they
seem to recapture some of their initial magic in the quarantine specials. I hope that in future Seasons they will continue this pattern. Though I understand that they are trying to reach new audience members, the show still needs to continue to grow with its current audience.","7","11 September 2021"
"67","If I had to choose only one TV show to watch - it would be South Park. So far they haven't gone to the politically correct side and continue to make fun of fat people, ugly people, gays, transgenders, blacks, redheads, disabled people, deformed, poor people, immigrants, foreigners, midgets, religion, politics, you name it. And it is so refreshing!! I lay awake at night worrying that it will become PC. Some of the episodes are confusing and not so funny but for me it continues to be that rare beacon in a dark dark lackluster PC-riddled entertainment storm. And FYI - I'm a baby boomer - not a teenager.","10","7 November 2017"
"68","In the age where many once great TV shows are being toned down so as not to 'offend anyone' (see Family Guy about gay jokes, or removing characters or episodes from The Simpsons), this show doesn't do that. In fact, to this day, it satirically (yet accurately) portrays the events and issues of our times, and I can't thank the creators enough for sticking to their origins and not letting go!South Park seems stupid and childish at first glance with its fart (and other types) jokes, but beyond all that is really solid commentary about politics or people's stereotypical behaviour. And that, to me, is the hidden genius of South Park. It makes crude and simple jokes, ones you would probably never laugh at, actually funny.The animations throughout the show are simple, and might seem amateurish at first, however, despite the simplicity of design, it is actually very well thought out with a visual language of its own that stands out from the rest. The only thing I dislike is 'breaking the fourth wall' with its real-life objects scattered here and there. I mean, it makes the show kind of funnier in a silly way, but I don't like it when people put real-life stuff into animation.Lastly, I find it remarkable how well this show has stood the test of time, I mean, new episodes are still very funny (like actually funny and well thought out), which just gets me to wonder - how do they keep coming up with new ideas? Arguably, this might be because of the lower episode count in newer seasons, but I still find that amazing.Parker and Stone, please keep up the great work and the legacy you have already set with your creation.","10","17 May 2020"
"69","This series deserves nothing less than a perfect 10! Many episodes have an amazing storyline. Makes me laugh everytime after a busy day. It's funny, gross, very very well made! Hats-off to the creators!","10","17 July 2021"
"70","No-one should make the critical error of underestimating Trey Parker. It takes a very intelligent and rational person to create such a clever, balanced mix of sharp satire and plain ol' buffoonery.SP is a blessing. The main reason for this is that viewers like me finally got a comedy show that is politically INcorrect in the purest sense of the term. There are other TV shows and programs that CLAIM to be un-PC (like the ironically titled ""Politically Incorrect"" with its liberal, left-wing, politically correct, ridiculously biased and nearly retarded host Bill Maher), but SP is one the truly rare ones with its heart in the right place (alongside ""Penn & Teller"", and perhaps ""The Howard Stern Show"").Stone and Parker may appear as a couple of lunatics at first (in the best possible sense), but they are cynics/skeptics of the finest sort, hence anyone who perceives SP as just a dumb cartoon with round-faced kids who say ""f***"" all the time must be either a Left-wing extremist, a Right-wing moron, or someone who has never seen more than one episode. Sure it's sometimes just silly nonsense, but more often than not the show targets specific political or social themes in such a wonderful, straight-forward, and clear-headed manner that I sometimes wonder how they get away with it. How do they get away with all those racial themes (black stereotypes, SARS-infected Chinese getting smeared on carpets, Indians who sing like Indians etc.)? How do they get away with Affleck getting oral sex from J-Lo (i.e. Cartman's hand) or Cartman wrestling with a preachy dwarf? How do they get away with a thousand other things I thought were hilarious? Probably the high ratings; it might be that simple. SP wasn't nearly as wild, consistent, and well-written in its early seasons as it had become from approximately season 4 onwards. The momentum has grown, the world-wide popularity giving them the freedom to go really nuts and molest any celebrity and expose any hypocrisy they deem worthy of the show's very high standards. Anybody and anything is fair game, it seems. True, sometimes they go too far: as is the case with Steve Irwin's death, Dawkins having cartoon-sex with the sex-changed teacher, or Cartman having Butters' penis in his mouth (as a prank), but on the other hand WHERE can you find Gandhi and Princess Diana as inhabitants of Hell! One of the things that are most enjoyable about SP is that they nearly always make fun of celebrities that are the most despicable, exposing them for the morons and a**holes that they are. (That episode ending with lice inhabiting Anjelina Jolie's genitals is PRICELESS!) Parker's creation is politically pretty much neutral, making it one of extremely few shows/movies that deal with political and social issues without taking the side of one political flank. Hence it isn't mere propaganda, as ""The Simpsons"" or any George Clooney or Michael Moore movie, but offers a fair assessment of both sides to any issue. Parker had the balls to be the only one in show-biz not to present Bush as a moron or a criminal at the height of the anti-Bush bashing craze.SP is the show ""The Simpsons"" could have been, were it not controlled by its ex-hippie, Marxist producers: ""The Simpsons"" had Lisa to preach its liberal <U+0096> i.e. politically correct - messages, and in the most unfunny and annoying New-Age manner. Homer and Bart are great, but that show was good only for a couple of seasons after which it degenerated. SP, on the other hand, continually improves with time. It is baffling that some people think the show has lost its edge after season 7 or 8. If anything, the opposite is true; seasons 9, 10, and 11 are just as good as 5-8, if not better. The stories are getting more absurd, funnier, the writing is tighter, while Eric Cartman is being established as a cultural ""icon"" of the best/worst kind (depending on whether he is exterminating hippies or playing a neo-Nazi).",NA,"12 January 2007"
"71","South Park, on the surface, look like a immature cartoon that just try to do offensive joke just for the sake of it, and yes, this is sometime the case. But that being said, when you dive into the series, you realise how South Park is just a satirical version of our society and his social flaws.Its also worth pointing that this is a rare case for me of a TV series that just get better season after season. Every season are great, and they are still a the top of their game, 24 years later. Maybe its because the world is getting more and more divisive and silly, and its giving plenty of material for Trey and Matt for the show.","9","16 April 2021"
"72","I've been watching this since the beginning, and I swear the social satire is getting even better. I hope this show runs for many more years, as long as it stays at this level.","9","22 October 2019"
"73","I absolutely love older South Park for its amazing humor and a really cool idea of four 10 year olds cussing and throwing around slurs. It was funny to watch them do normal kid activities (like playing detectives or going to a amusement park) while talking like actual adults. Nowadays it's not about Kyle, Stan, Cartman and Kenny. Instead, Matt and Trey decided to take a background character and make him the star of this show. With stupid jokes about weed that were actually funny, but only the first 2 times, this show is just not funny and actually kinda painful to watch. Such a sad downfall of once great series.","7","5 May 2021"
"74","I like some episodes of this show. South Park in recent years has been more about the town and it's other characters; not always just focused on the four young boys. Garrison seems to no-longer have in drama with his sexuality, gender or any drama for that matter; Liane id not really a sex manic at the moment. But certain things haven't changed; Cartman is a bigot that makes him the character who is he. Butter is always confused or curious. Stan is always righteous, Kenny seems to be Princess Kenny/Mytserion or whomever he wants to be, Kyle is still a Jew. So this show may go onto it's 20th season. Well let the twisted humor live on!","10","23 June 2014"
"75","Now, unlike most people, I give anything of entertainment value, be it a performance, a movie, or a TV show a chance. whether it was raved  or hated by a wide range of people is irrelevant. If it strikes me as a curiosity, I might be tempted to check it out.So, I watched an episode which was said to be the ""best"" one. I don't remember the name of it, but two of the characters were on trial and they were continuing to bother the judge with flatulence (or flatulence sounds). This went on forever. And what was said to be a hilarious TV show (at least according to a nerd I knew at work) turned out to be one of the most annoyingly inane experiences I ever had in my life. I couldn't even get through the first 15 minutes. And there's no way I'm going to give it another chance by watching another segment. If this is as good as it gets, I made up my mind. I have civil rights, and as a citizen, should not have them violated by brain frying torture. This doesn't even count as entertainment; it's the worst form of punishment any human being could get.I could only think of a few other experiences in my life that rank as bad as the show: Finding out a Republican was going to win prior to the ""I'm right and you're wrong"" Reagan years; Seeing my pet lizard (which I loved) dead from starvation because my neighbor refused to feed it when I was on vacation; and then, watching any movie affiliated with the names ""Sandler"" and ""Shore."" Alas, ""South Park"" will now have a place on this list.",NA,"30 June 1999"
"76","When I was growing in the late 1990s, I had heard from my classmates about a new cartoon show that was so vulgar, irreverent and hilarious, that it seemed impossible for me to ever watch it - given my sheltered upbringing. By chance, late one night, I had the opportunity to view animated, adult-themed-comedy heaven; its name was ""South Park.""I was 12 in 1997 when ""South Park"" debuted - and was created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone - and caused an uproar with parental watchdog groups who contended that the show contributed to the downfall of American society in the cynical, politically-correct 1990s. Most importantly, however, they also argued that ""South Park"" was responsible for corrupting American youth.I especially like the second part, simply because I have such a hard time arguing that it's not true. ""South Park,"" as an adult-themed animated comedy series, was the cartoon show that I was waiting for at that time - a cartoon series that pulled no punches for the sake of political-correctness. And it was just so gosh-darn hilarious and profane; there was no way you could turn away from the comical mis-adventures of foul-mouthed South Park Elementary School third-graders Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny.And on top of all that, ""South Park"" also found the time to satirize aspects of American pop culture and relevant social issues - including racism, censorship and free speech, homosexuality, abortion, war, religion, gun control, etc. - yet not take a single side in any argument; Parker and Stone gleefully tout themselves as ""equal-opportunity offenders.""While I can say that I haven't watched this show in a long while (I guess you could say that I aged out of it once I hit high school), I still remember the uproar that it caused. It's really just too bad that shows like ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"" usurped its position as too-vulgar cartoon television. But ""South Park"" still paved the way for raucous, offensive animated comedy. And for that, it will never grow old.10/10","10","30 August 2015"

"78","You really gotta evaluate the times you live in when even South Park, the only remaining voice of reason of today's TV (let's call it that) caves under political correctness and starts pandering to women (not all, just the hateful and insecure ones who need to be patted on the back and called ""smart and funny"" every 5 minutes).I've gotten used to the fact that my ""male privilege"" is to be the only one who's allowed to be bullied, called anything, hit, having to work hard for everything I have, and see men portrayed badly in all TV shows and advertisements while those same pander to women, and being quiet about it. But when the last little shred of ""equality"" goes down, you know it's over, and society is at an all-time low. Men are cucked and take anything, women are insecure and always need the media to put men down while glorifying obnoxious behavior;2016 was a horrendous display of where humanity is at. The media kept lying about the 2016 election, and inexplicably - South Park went with it. Who needs facts when you can make some up, right? No one fact-checks anything, it's on the internet or your favorite TV channel, so it must be 100% true!South Park tried to have a continuous storyline for once, which was one of many things that went wrong, because the whole plot was flat out ridiculous. Even bottom-tier shows like Family Guy made me chuckle more this year.One thing's for sure, I'm not buying the new South Park game nor will I keep supporting what went rock bottom in pandering flames this year after 19 years of me praising and advertising it. You think you know a show. Family Guy started good and turned into a liberal PC mess, but I'd never wager South Park would go the same way. It was really sudden too. Gotta admire the laughs this show gave us in the past because that's it, it's over, and it clearly won't be cancelled with dignity, I can only imagine what goes on next year will be even worse and in compliance with the hateful, insecure nature of SJW culture.","1","8 December 2016"
"79","South Park is a very overrated show, some people hate it and find it too offensive. I find it funny and creative, with lots of clever satire discussing pop culture and current events. South Park episodes get produced in only one week which means they can keep with current events as of 2021. This show is absolutely brilliant, very crass and crude but smart. Definitely not for the easily offended with all the foul language, strong sexual content, graphic violence, and racial slurs. But if you enjoy controversial jokes and adult animation, then I highly recommend this show. Give it a chance, you won't regret it.10 STARS.","10","27 April 2021"
"80","It's only during the last couple seasons where you see Trey and Matt slipping up with all the Trump . It's obvious he doesn't quite know what to do with it.

"81","In a world of political cartooning that has become sub-Dilbert, and spoof movies that don't ever spoof anything unless it's not their intended targets; 'South Park' is, quite simply; a revelation.Sure, when it started out it really WASN'T much better than what it's detractor's accused it of being, but the fact that said detractors had never bothered to watch the show at all makes their opinion on those seasons null and void, anyway. And the fact that they based all of their subsequent reviews on those earliest seasons without watching the newer seasons says a lot about the intelligence of this show's detractors.As for SP itself, it's a truly hilarious mix of random surreal humor and good 'ol fashioned satire; with metaphors which range from the subtle to the ridiculously outrageous; think ""Peanuts"" by way of Ken Russel(with several tablespoons of Monty Python and a seasoning of Swift)and you have a pretty good idea of what you are in for. What's really amazing is how, since the idiotic things that happen on the show are almost a way of life(despite being called a ""quiet mountain town"" in the film; also excellent)the character's(intentionally)cliché reaction's have almost the same impact they would if the show was played straight. The fact that the character's have evolved but still retained their established personalities while dropping tired catch phrases and mannerisms is a mark of good writing.Don't listen to the addle-brain's who trash the show(one side'll say that the show is Republican propaganda, the other will say it's liberal propaganda, one side'll say the show has no political content whatsoever.), make up your own opinion; it's definitely worth forming one over.~","10","5 March 2009"
"82","South park is a very good show,there's weird and random and hilarious episodes,it mocks celebrity's in almost every episode (most likely every episode,the show revolds around four boys growing up in south park Colorado,the four boys are Eric Cartman,a Jew-hating fat boy who is simply hilarious,there's Stan,who is pretty much an everyday boy who tries to be a normal kid but cant keep up to his friends,there's Kyle,a Jewish kid who hates Cartman and his best friend is Stan,and there's Kenny,a kid who always has his hood up and always talks with his mouth underneath his hood and the kids all understand him,he also dies all the time and then is back again in the next episode (happens usually),south park is a great show with funny jokes and funny character.","10","24 April 2010"

"84","This show was a major part of my childhood. The earlier episodes were so funny and there are so many quotable lines. I still watch the newer episodes when I get the chance, but usually they're not that funny. It's like a different show now, but with the same characters. These new seasons just pick a joke and keep repeating it throughout. It's all political now.In a show that's been on so long, this is bound to happen. My rating of 7/10 is for seasons 1-8, cause those are the ones I grew up on and the ones that I still find funny. Everything after that would be a lower rating because I feel it declined in quality, but I still think it has its funny moments. South Park will still go down as the best cartoon ever","7","28 July 2019"

The nails were hammered in all the right places and the b.utt of most jokes (we all know who they are haha) will get angry and rage, well, the ones who get they are being mocked, at least. I reckon lots of them will miss it by a mile.I have read reviews here from people hilariously blind, who wouldn't see the joke and satire if it came riding on a gold flying elephant two feet away. Of course those people won't like the show. Their loss.Can't wait for the next season! (Yes, I bought the ""season finale"" antics lol).","9","20 November 2019"

"88","The OLD South Park was great. It had laughs a minute, and it followed the exploits of 4 very naughty boys... but since 2018, the show has gotten lost in the weeds, and it hasn't been funny ever since. Even the latest 2019 episodes are thoroughly un-funny. The pre-2018 South Park I'll give a 9/10 rating, but anything since 2018 gets a 4/10 and that's being generous, since it's supposed to be a comedy series yet these latest episodes simply aren't funny.","7","28 November 2019"
"89","Each episode before season 20 is a masterpiece and season 1 just blows my mind on the writting ability.

Sure the newer seasons aren't what they used to be but at the begging South Park was unmatched","9","25 February 2020"
"90","Season 1: Although it's animated, it's hilariously crude and controversial. Although it's targeted for adults, it still carries sweet childlike morals. And although it's fairly basic, it's nearly damn perfect! South Park is the popular inappropriate series best for mature teens, due to content such as profanity, sexual references and even animated violence, but each episode is an entertaining ""fresh start"" to the previous episode. South Park could literally blow up the world, and in the next episode, nothing happened. The frequent humour will likely offend some, but it's basically just a spoof of real life and animations.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","8","23 February 2022"
"91","This show is pure comedy gold. Everyone takes one look at it and sees the silly animation and the foul mouth young kids and automatically assume its the dumbest show ever but on the contrary it is one of the smartest comedies on T.V. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are clearly very smart and very talented writers using hilarious satire in their episodes to laugh at the world.This show is about 4 foul mouth young boys who live in a small town in Colorado called South Park. They are always the source of crazy things happening and they always get into wacky and hilarious adventures.This show is one of the best comedies on T.V and one of the best shows on T.V period. It has been a bit of a disappointment lately though however because I think their earlier episodes were much funnier but I don't think thats because the guys have no ideas any more I think they are just getting old and lazy after 15 years of this show.","8","16 November 2012"
"92","Although crude, abrasive and rough around the edges, Southpark is perhaps the greatest modern day political cartoon being made. I am continually surprised by how the creators write, create and air an episode within a few months of the event the are ""discussing"".The reason this show keeps me engaged is its ability to remain non-biased and illustrate the ridiculousness of the hype around the subject matter in the episodes. From smoking to racism to Scientology to Britany Spears, Trey Parker and Matt Stone find a way to get me to question subjects that I normally take at face value. At times they even make fun of themselves for the sake of proving a point. It seems that every time I get into a discussion about current events I can site and episode of Southpark to support my (or someones) point.I ask that no matter how terrible you think the show is, watch it and look past some of the obscene jokes and interpret/understand the underlying meaning in the show. I am surprised English teachers aren't more supportive of the show given the symbolic nature of most of their characters.","10","22 July 2008"
"93","The show has had some dips in it but it always bounces back. It is always entertaining.","10","23 January 2021"
"94","I've only seen 3 episodes of this and not once did I laugh. First of all the so called ""mature"" content and subject matter is ironically juvenile, in fact juvenile is a completely relevant term for this. Toilet humor, gratuitous violence with (fake) blood and gore, exploitative sex, and excessive heavy swearing, I see no humor in that. The artwork resembles that of a 1st grader's art project and even the voice acting is juvenile, from the four main kids to the celebrity cameos. Some have said that there is some good stuff in this show, but that's like trying to find gold in a pile of rotting fish. Don't get me wrong, I do occasionally like irreverent humor such as SNL, Harold and Kumar (juvenile but not to the total extreme), Daily show to name a few. It's just that I don't approve of comedy that's totally exploitative and random for no apparent reason other than try (unsuccessfully) to make someone both laugh and think.","1","3 September 2015"
"95","first off , Matt Stone and Trey Parker are geniuses . This show isn't afraid to go where other cartoons have ever gone before , and second all you people need to stop bagging on this show because the show is a F***ing masterpiece. I applaud Matt Stone and Trey Parker for having a set of balls","10","21 October 2003"
"96","South park has just been on the air way too long and they've run out of ideas and talent. I remember fondly such episodes as ""Cancelled"", ""Goobacks"", ""imaginationland"", and the zany, ridiculous original episodes that earned them the catchphrases and cadences they would eventually just repeat throwing in obscure insulting pop culture references and basically what amounts to stupid cartoon hazing. They took the fact that their audiences applauded such episodes as the one they parodied jersey shore to mean that this was somehow their niche as ""cultural ambassadors"" constantly telling people how to feel on pop culture issues, and their show lost its depth and diversity and became a breeding ground for just plain horribleness, the worst of which, and damn near unwatchable is the episode ""i never should have gone ziplining"". But i can't say i'm not without my fond memories of what south park used to be.I do have a theory as to what led to this, as we all know Trey Parker and Matt Stone have not been with South Park for a long time, leaving South Park in the hands of writers who tried first to use their own original ideas, but would later try to perfect the recipe for success used by their predecessors and ultimately fail miserably. There's also a certain pessimism that comes with their own particular brand of parody, and this is even recognized by the writers later in such episodes as ""raising the bar"" and ""you're getting old"", where the entire premise of the episodes is basically a sociopolitical statement about their own experiences and the lengths they've stooped to to try and market content. I get it, its better than the rest of their recent episodes and i think its very big of them to admit that but its not necessarily what defines good television and if they're going to keep it on the air the least they could do is bring back good plot and original, 3 dimensional characters. So basically the verdict is, watch this show, but do not watch anything after season 13, and you can preserve in your mind a worthwhile show that would be probably more towards 8.5-9 stars. I'm crossing my fingers and still watching in case they haven't jumped the shark for good, but its gotten pretty bad, worse than lost final season plothole bad, so i'm not expecting much unless Trey and Matt get more involved.","7","15 January 2014"
"97","South Park continues to excel as perhaps the best show on television( in my opinion at least). While the last few seasons hinted at a possible downtrend, the current season has been hilarious, smart, clever and downright enjoyable. Some people look at the show and they see the crude humor and the sometimes offensive positions taken by the characters. However, South Park is so much more than that. It tackles many different events that occur in the world in a smart and funny way. Matt Stone and Trey Parker always find the best way to parody the major events in the world. Everything they put into each episode is supposed to be there, even though it may seem offensive or disgusting. In order to truly appreciate South Park, you have to look past the obvious things, and look at the meaning behind the things that are said and the actions that the characters do; because when this happens, you see the true magic that makes South Park one of the best shows on television","10","22 November 2014"
"98","Like I said back in my Tosh.0 review that this was only one of the few shows I loved to watch on Comedy Central. The premise for the show is that four young and rambunctious boys Eric Cartman, Kyle Brofloski, Stan Marsh, And Kenny McCormick getting into some hairy, ridiculous and unbelievable situations. My favorite episode has to be, ""Cartman Land"", where Cartman opens up a theme park and he is the only one allowed in it. This a wild and ridiculous show but funny and believe or not heartwarming at the same time.Rated TV-MA DLSV For Suggestive Dialouge, Language, Sexual Content, And Violence.30min.Numerous uses of the F-word( Like Tosh.0 I can barely keep track).****/****",NA,"2 November 2011"

"100","South Park is the funniest cartoon show on television. The writing is brilliant. And I love how they approach every topic they bring up on the show. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are one of the few comedians which can joke about almost everything and still make a good point. The characters are hilarious; Cartman, Randy and Mr Macky are amongst my favourites.Many people will probably argue with me when I tell them that South Park is the greatest cartoon show ever. Most people will probably tell me that The Simpsons is a better show. Now, it's not that I don't like The Simpsons. It WAS a great show in the early seasons. But The Simpsons has gotten horrible over the past seasons. South Park on the other hand is still going strong. Even though some episodes are not as good as others, they are still good.","10","23 February 2008"
"101","The first two or three seasons of ""South Park"" were brilliant, but the show grew stale fast. While still occasionally scoring with some brilliant social satire (i.e., ""The Passion of Mel Gibson""), Matt Stone and Trey Parker have boxed themselves into a hole where they constantly have to outdo themselves in gross-out humor. What began as courageous iconoclasm is now just mindless scatology. Also, I'm disturbed by the show's latent crypto-conservative ideology. Liberal intellectuals and people in the media who have liberal views (especially Rosie O'Donnell) are presented as self-righteous, hypocritical blowhards. The boys never stop to think that maybe the liberal elite is right, maybe middle America really is full of mindless yahoos . . . by excoriating the left they're unwittingly playing into the hands of the very people who would love nothing better than to take them off the air. What was good dirty fun a few years ago now seems like a desperate attempt by two aging hipsters to remain relevant.","5","25 November 2006"
"102","It is the funniest show ever very rude and offensive it's so good highly recommend it I know some episodes are very inappropriate but kids over maybe 11 or twelve can watch it well depends what you let your child watch if they have ever watched a fifteens comedy they can watch this.","10","20 February 2022"
"103","Yes, South Park is very crude. The voices of impersonated celebrities are poor(as they admit!), and they occasionally may seem to pander to one political viewpoint or another. However, compared to most of the other biased crap on TV(on both sides), SP just doesn't give a rip. They put their own outrageous spin on everything going on in American society, and instead of really forcing a view of what to do about it down your throat, they poke fun and holes in the absurdity of the whole situation--perhaps of life itself. It is meant to be ridiculous commentary and cynical sarcasm about life in the USA and pop culture crap in general. People that don't get this show, or think it should be more preachy, or be sanitized from potty humor, don't get it at all. Sometimes, the show gets a bit tired(like any show, especially one this old!), but in using current events, it is really able to continue the laughs and the hilarity. SP is not perfect, but it makes you think in a way that also makes you laugh. Reveling in its own childish stupidity, it uses this to portray a country lost in its own stupid reality-- of celebrity ""news"", lame fads, PC absurdity, impractical ideologies, political opportunists, hypocrisy on every level, and a whole lot more.","9","12 September 2017"

"105","I'll get the obvious statement out of the way. This show is not,I repeat not for kids. (Personally,I wouldn't even let a ""teen"" of mine watch it.) ..but....speaking on a more mature and intelligent level about the show,if you put aside the vulgarities (that being harsh language and certain things that even I have to cover my eyes for)the show really is quite good and downright funny.In fact,even without ""pushing the envelope"" as they say,this show would still be great. What I really do like about the show is despite the kids' attitudes,they are still portrayed in an innocent 8 year old manner. It's somehow cute to watch these boys get totally confused about what the adults around them are talking about.One example is Eric Cartman thinking that boys start to turn into men by having a period like women do. (He gets this idea because he bled in a certain manner I'm sure viewers out there know about.) The other boys believe him and wait for their ""period"" so they can be more grown up.On the simpler level,when they get that innocent look of pure joy on their face it's funny to me,when they get big dumb grins on their faces because they see a girl they like. Spoiled brat & bully Cartman getting sent to juvenile jail and breaking down and crying,""I want my mommy!"" was not only funny but actually touching. Showing that he's not as tough as he thinks he is. The simplest thing that makes me laugh is just Timmy saying his name over & over (I'm not sure why.) The little boy Butters is also innocently hilarious and mixed up as well as the boy known as Tweek (a kid with an anxiety complex brought on by too much caffine.)I definitely crack-up when Stan is forced to be in a basement with Pip,Butters and some 1st grade boy,while the adults are at a party upstairs. The 3 ""Melvins"" (as Stan calls them) sing this silly song,""Tippy-tippy too too,la-la-la"". It never fails to make me laugh!The adults are sometimes as clueless as the kids and seem to not handle situations in a mature manner as grown-ups should. If they could though,it wouldn't be South Park. If the show didn't poke fun at the famous,it wouldn't be South Park. Those folks out there who wont tolerate the fouler things about this show,it's simple,don't watch but also don't complain about it because if it's truly not for you that's fine but don't try to preach to others. Different people like different things.Currently,the show has gone into syndicated (and edited) reruns and I'm catching up that way (I've really only had cable once but just for a year)I didn't get to see the shows when they were first on but now,I do like them but for the humor and storyline that's lies within the things people complain about the most. The show is funny,period! Want simpler comedy?,watch The Coby Show. (END) 7 out of ten stars by the way.","7","16 November 2005"
"106","I used to look forward to watching South Park because I found it original and hilarious. Nobody does a better ""Cartman"" impersonation than me.Now, I refuse to watch it. I haven't watched it since they mocked the Virgin Mary ( a statue where fart sounds came from the rectum ). Enough is enough. I was troubled when they mocked disabled people, African Americans, Chinese people, gays, the Pope, etc....Yet, I still tuned in occasionally. Mocking the Blessed Virgin and showing Cartman screaming, ""F--- Jesus"" did it. No more Southpark.Mocking Christianity is safe. Nobody will hunt you down and slice off your head. Not so with Islam. I don't think it's funny to mock people with disabilities, mock people for their ethnicity, or for their religious beliefs. In Hitler's Germany, Jews were mocked before it turned really ugly. Enough of Southpark. It's a nasty show, cloaked in comedy.","1","19 December 2008"
"107","South Park is yet another of those shows that, in my opinion, is outrageously, conformist. In spite of its subversive pretensions, South Park, is, in my view, really little more than a mildly amusing, reiteration of mainstream values. The kind trotted out by big corporations,the mainstream media and big government, politicians. With a few rude little cartoon characters, swear words and some toilet humour thrown in, to soften the blow.As such I tend to label this kind of satire, deeply superficial. Like so much entertainment today, it makes a lot of noise but if you are paying attention, you may find it really has very little to say. What a shame. Four out of ten from me.","4","20 September 2016"
"108","Oh boy, South Park. I have quite a lot to say about this show. Let me make one thing perfectly clear; I love this show. To me this is like the Monty Python of animated shows. The episode plots, the characters, the writing, the situations, the jokes, the social satire are all perfect. I can't think of another show that's had such an impact on my sense of humor. Sure, Family Guy is come pretty close but Family Guy has gone downhill in the last few years. South Park has only gotten better and better. Mostly because they have tackled current things and it never becomes dated. For example, when Facebook was a new thing, South Park would make an episode about it, or when Cloverfield just came out or Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. And the jokes they make are spot on. The show has a lot of gross-out humor as well, which goes overboard, but it's also backed up with some great satire. I guess I'll talk about the main characters. First, there's Stan; he's the leader of the group and when they're in a bad situation, he's always the one who just mentions how absurd it is. Bottom line, Stan is like able and open-minded. Then there's Cartman, my favorite character by far. He's racist, self-centered, foul-mouthed, evil, mischievous, psychotic, and sociopathic, in other words, he's the king of the assh*les. Then there's Kenny; he wears an orange coat over his face so it's hidden and his voice is muffled. But in some episodes we've seen his face and heard him talk, but they keep having him wear the coat, I guess, because it's so memorable. Kenny dies like in every episode in the most absurd ways possible, then he wakes up without a scratch kind of like in Groundhog Day. And then there's Kyle; I never really liked him, he's really winey and can be kind of a douchebag, but not in the same way as Cartman. But with that said, I couldn't see the show without Kyle. Some of my other favorite characters include Butters (Cartman's sidekick), Mr. Garrison (The school's perverted teacher) and Chef (The chef at the school cafeteria). There has not been and episode on this show that hasn't made me laugh, not one. Even the ones that aren't that memorable have great moments. And South Park is more than just a show that makes me laugh, no, South Park is glorious. I don't know where I would be if I never watched the show. The show has tackled some many real-life issues that it really has the answer when I'm in a bad situation. Whenever I watch an episode, it doesn't just make me laugh, it really speaks to me. At the end of an episode the main characters say ""you know, I've learned something today."" Another thing that I love so much about this show is the payoffs. These episodes have some the greatest set-ups than any show I can think of. I see the first two minutes of the episode and I've got to know what happens in the end and the payoff is totally worth it. The episodes have all this build-up and the endings are extremely satisfying. Every episode is basically a joke with a giant punch line at the end. Overall, this is one of my very favorite shows and so glad that it's still around. Trey Parker and Matt Stone (the creators) are freakin' geniuses. Hey, if The Simpsons can go on for that long, I hope South Park can as well. The animation is basically a giant arts and crafts project made out of stop-motion construction paper. There's not a ton of money thrown into the animation which is great because the creators are doing so much with so little money. That really says something.",NA,"29 June 2012"
"109","I don't understand. I just don't understand. How can a cartoon made in 1997 get so much air time. I used to like it when I was a teenager. It helped me pass biology, but now it is just painful to watch these days. It is unbearable. I found out about the grating voices and how far they can outdo themselves. They go over the top with their jokes. They milk it up until the cow ran out of milk. Do they stop? No. They go on and on and on. They rip off the cow's udder, cut open the cow and rip out it's innards and run around the place splattering them around. It becomes unbearable and uncomfortable to watch. Heiefer Lopez annoyed me big time (that I would race for the remote and press the mute button and be grateful for it). Season 13 was the worst season ever! Apart from ""The Pee"", where a flood of urine destroys a water park, ""Dead Celebrities"" was the last episode I watched. Ike sees the ghosts of dead celebrities, and gets possessed by Michael Jackson's ghost! The climax to this episode is a complete eyesore. He has to enter a child beauty pageant and win. I am very grateful for the still button in my remote. I just press still and all I get to see is a still image (like a background), and hear all the action and leave it to my imagination. Seeing Ike in his school clothes, sleepers, dressed as a pirate, dressed as a president. It's cute. Seeing him in drag, it's like a cake, except replace the icing and sprinkles with trash, mud, dirt mold and impure water. I can't eat the cake! This image is to my eyes as this cake is to my mouth. Cartman is annoying now. I have to say that Stan Marsh continues the tradition of such great comedians such as, Oliver Hardy, Spanky, Moe Howard, and Budd Abbot. This show gets too much airtime on Comedy Central. I used to like it as a teenager, but as an adult. By the way, this has been, ""Matthew Rambles.""","3","16 February 2013"
"110","This show is great! The first series was very good, but then it dropped off a little in Series 2 and 3, however the introduction of Butters, Timmy and Ms. Choksondik has made the series much much better. A great improvement has been made to series 4 and series 5 is even better.The Simpsons maybe everyones favorite family, but this show is improving and quite frankly the Simpson's plots are getting worse.South Park already has a movie (quite successful and a good laugh) and it hasn't finished it, unlike the apparent rumors that The Simpsons will be finished when the movie is being made.How the kids respond to Kenny's death now has been improved, so you don't put up with ""Oh my god, they  killed Kenny"" every week.To finish, great show hope it goes on.",NA,"24 January 2002"
"111","I understand how South Park are just despise Family Guy. Family Guy should have more characters like South park. Dysfunctional family did not work for the show. South park more like Shameless and Cleveland show. Great characters around era of cartoon in late 90s. It was very rude and irrelevants which show curse words. We just need more Butter and Tina to show more Rallo Tubbs obsessed power and sometime hurt Eric badly uness Eric cruel to Butter. Butter should learn kill his parents from Damien's advice and envy Stan.
The show develop more moral lesson they learn so did Family Guy. South park criticize on Family Guy's budget they making. Just do more sequel. Family Guy needs to owe this show a lot otherwise Family Guy will cancelled third time. Problem is the show did not alway make crude jokes like Family Guy(usually). Token need change character more like Freeman Boondock.","10","29 August 2018"
"112","The characters: Stan and Kyle are Trey and Matt's cartoon counterparts and the two characters often exhibit the views and opinions of the creators themselves. These two main characters are best friends (as are Matt and Trey) and usually are the voice of reason. Matt and Trey also voice their tales of morality via these two. In the earlier seasons this would come in the form of ""you know, i learned something today"". Eric Cartman on the other hand is the personification of evil. He's a manipulative, racist, sexist, antisemitic trouble maker and has an increasingly contentious feud with Kyle (a jew). Kenny, on the other hand, is an underprivileged fun loving and altruistic character who's always there for his friends. These four dynamic characters are the center of most episodes and they are what make this show great. They offer a look into the human psyche. They also give the otherwise cynical show somewhat of a heart. They keep the show from being a dark and self-righteous satire.The adult characters on the other hand are usually the center of the satire and often exhibit hypocritical and incredibly buffoonish behavior. They serve to present the overall hypocrisy of America as a nation. It is through these characters that Matt and Trey show what is wrong with this country (the elementary school teacher with the unresolved daddy issues, the inept school counselor who is a big time hoarder, the president of the country who doesn't seem to care about beavers, etc.) In fact, the only sane adult whom the children connect with is Chef, the kind advice-giving cafeteria worker.The episodes: what i love about most south park episodes is that they always juxtapose a seemingly simple situation with some underlying social criticism. and they blend the two so well. It's hard to believe each episode is made in only one week, considering how well crafted it is.Terrence and Philip show: This is not a huge part of the show. The Terrence and Philip Show is a Canadian TV show that most kids in town are obsessed with. It mainly features fart jokes and is despised by most adults. I brought this up because when I watch south park i feel like the four kids watching the t&p show. Most of my elders don't understand why i watch this ""simple minded cartoon"". but to me it is more than just kenny lighting his farts on fire. To me south park is a brilliant and hysterical satire that I can never get tired of watching. And I believe this is how the kids must feel when watching the t&p show.","10","21 August 2012"
"113","I use to watch South Park around the early 2000's when it doesn't focus its episodes on pop cultured related items or what is in the news (e.g - Britney Spears breakdown in 2008 and Writer Guild Strikes of 2007/08 or the 1% protests of 2011). Yes South Park had done some pop cultured episodes around the early 2000's like the Queer Eye show, but they've made it in a hilarious way and that they've made original episodes, like the Towelie and yes they've made some pop cultured reference in that episode too, but they don't focus on that completely. When you look at the episodes between 2006 - 2012, like HumancentiePad, that is nothing by the craze of the Apple iPad and the movie 'The Human Centipede', which have nothing in common! So why make it comedy? Plus in the 'Coon and Friends' special, there is Cartman and that monster thing killing Justin Beiber, what is the joke in that? Everyone hates Justin Beiber when other places, like the internet, did that as well during the whole overrated 'Beiberfever', it's not original anymore. South Park's pop cultured episodes were funny around the early 2000's. The episodes nowadays just rely on pop cultured comedy to make it funny. The show has its day.","1","16 June 2013"

"115","I remember watching the series premiere as a preteen back in 1997 and absolutely loving the subversive humor. I was a regular viewer up until around 2012, and have only occasionally watched it since then. With the entire series available to stream on Amazon Prime it finally felt like it was time to revisit this old favorite. I have to say that the early seasons (1-7) are still absolutely hilarious. Yes, it's a lot of toilet humor, and sometimes there are not so great takes, but the show is of its time and it seems it's continued to grow and age with the audience. Seasons 3 and 4 are standouts for me, not just in terms of nostalgia, but also because the humor is still good.","8","15 September 2021"
"116","There are a lot of words that are associated with the high praise of South Park.None of them are really accurate.The fact is that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are jerks. They really are, there is no better word for them. However, they are hysterical jerks.It's not satire and it's not social commentary. What you are doing is watching Parker and Stone ruthlessly mock people. Just because the cruel mockery is witty and intelligent doesn't make it any better.However...it is witty and intelligent, and it is hysterical...so even though it gives you the feeling that you are laughing with the school yard bully, you're still laughing.And you are still laughing because it is funny.","10","25 February 2019"

"118","Cartman is funny but i hate him. half the time things turn out the way he predicts and that is really sick and messed up but sometimes it is so idiotic that it makes me laugh. However without Cartman there is no southpark. I like butters on the male characters. I also like Wendy but she is the only girl that I know. I hate Cartman's mom she's really stupid and annoying for enabling Cartman like that especially in Make Love, Not Warcraft while Cartman plays Cyber warcraft she allows him to take a dump in a bucket so that he doesn't leave the game. Also Randy is much worse. I hate him most of the time except in Medicinal Fried Chicken. Randy at his worst going undercover dressed like a female hooker and actually blows people. my favourite episode was 'Scot Tenorman must die', It is hilarious but shows Cartman as really dark and twisted but also clever. The best episode by far is ""The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers"" the only thing that comes close is ""Good Times with Weapons"". other episodes worth mentioning are: The Death of Eric Cartman, Professor Chaos, Fishsticks, Whale Whores, , Coon vs. Coon and Friends including other episodes the kids superheroes in action. Faith Hilling, Sarcastaball and Game of thrones spoof trilogy where cartman meets people in the betrayal garden right before he betrays them. Also another special episode worth your time is 'Butters' Very Own Episode'. there are many more episodes cool episodes but when watching there is a limit to how much you can watch at a time due to the crudeness.",NA,"23 April 2015"

"120","One interesting theory has it that artists do their best work when they are in complete obscurity, thus not having much of an audience to influence their work. There have been some notable exceptions to this, such as The Cure, but with all the South Parks out there, they only serve to prove the rule.South Park's funniest season was its first, and it is no coincidence that the episode I enjoy most is the pilot. Seeing aliens converse with cows as if they were discussing the shape of the future to come was quite a laugh in and of itself. The only other episode that comes close is Mecha-Streisand. The sheer thought of no more Babs records coming out ever again was enough to make me root for Robert Smith, I can tell you. But after these episodes became a big hit, that's where it all fell down.What made the first series so funny was that the jokes were unexpected and surprising. But, to (possibly slightly mis-) quote Sasha Mitchell in Kickboxer 2: ""When you swear so much, it loses its meaning"". This applies to all sorts of forms of expression, be it a guitar chord in C# minor, or even a string of expletives in Spanish. If you don't vary things just a touch, the meaning of the words soon gets lost. And South Park's repetitious attack of the fourth graders who aren't even literate enough to get expletives down to less than fifty percent of their daily speech is losing its meaning. I do not relate to this fourth graders at all, and I find it rather insulting, both as a creative human being and as a 20-something crowd member, that Trey and Matt think I should.Sometimes the episodes improve in quality for a moment, like Cow Days, but there's only so many times you can talk about one's butt or what comes out of it before people switch off and go looking for something else. Which is exactly what has been happening since the movie arrived on home video formats.",NA,"9 April 2001"
"121","I've got a question for all of you REALLY big SOUTH PARK fans:  Is this an acquired taste or if you don't get it that first time, you'll never get it? I think I may be the latter because I've watched the show twice and both times it didn't do a thing for me.  I just don't think that the show is as clever as Stone and Parker or maybe even the fans seem to think that it is. I saw the part about Janet Reno dressing like the Easter Bunny to get some immigrant children out of a house which aired shortly after the Elian Gonzalez raid . . . tain't funny!  I've got nothing against foul language, but that in and of itself isn't funny nor is the fact that it's coming out of the mouths of babes, so to speak.       I WILL say that I like the animation style of the show.  It reminds me of those home movies that kids used to send into the TV show ""Zoom"" back in the Seventies. It makes it look as if the show actually were produced by children . . . that is, until they open their mouths.  When it comes to adult-themed animated shows, I'll stick with the king:  ""The Simpsons"". Sometimes, there is something to be said for subtlety.","4","31 October 2000"
"122","SPOILERS In 1997 Matt Stone and Trey Parker, two friends from Colorado University, released the first episode of a long running television show. That show, ""South Park"", is an extreme animated show containing some of the sickest jokes on television in a long time. The show is currently in season nine in mid 2005, and despite the occasional weak episode, it remains as hilarious and offencive as ever.South Park, Colorado, a small redneck town full of some of the most obscure people you are ever likely to meet. Two boys, Stan Marsh (Parker) and best friend Kyle Broslofski (Stone) spend their time trying to live a simple, quiet life and make it through school. With fellow friend, and regular corpse, Kenny McCormick (also Stone), the boys experience outlandish adventure after outlandish adventure. All whilst trying to get rid of fat, offencive, evil Eric Cartman (also Parker). Together these four boys experience life as only children can.The beauty of ""South Park"" is that over eight years, it has remained constantly fresh. With stories involving topics as varied as the American Election and a 'Great Expectations' spoof, the series has constantly produced belly laughs for years now.The series has also constantly poked fun at people as varied as the Jewish community, Paris Hilton and regular victim Barbara Streisand. In fact, ""South Park"" has spent so much time poking fun at people, that it's an absolute miracle that it's still on the air. Still, this miracle is an absolute blessing because the series often says about celebrities exactly what we're thinking.Often overshadowed by equally amazing cartoons ""The Simpsons"", ""Family Guy"" and ""Futurama"", this series remains as fresh as it has ever been. Constantly changing, with characters who evolve as individuals, ""South Park"" is one of the most extreme and most hilarious programmes on television. Long live ""South Park"" and God bless Trey Parker and Matt Stone.",NA,"12 April 2005"
"123","South Park is my absolute favourite tv show, the writing is clever and the jokes are hilarious, I have seen shows like breaking bad, sons of anarchy, game of thrones, and other animation shows like family guy and rick and morty but south park has much more clever writing and is excellent there is rarely an episode that don't make me laugh, I have rewatched the whole show 4 times and will continue to watch for the rest of my life, BEST SHOW EVER!!!","10","8 July 2021"
"124","Haven't seen ""South Park"" for at least 15 years. Took time to watch the entire series (277 episodes and 1 movie to date) and was very impressed with how it still holds up and challenges social standards and sociopolitical ideals with clever and often brutal satire. Some amazing episodes in there.This year I worked through all of ""The Simpsons"", ""Futurama"", ""King of the Hill"" and ""South Park"" episodes ever made and it is clear that ""South Park"" became the strongest contender for animated comedy and social relevance some time ago, mostly competing with ""The Simpsons"" for pole position. That show has lost the plot, grown stale as it nears 30 years, and appears to be winding down. ""South Park"", however, feels like it is still on the boil and could remain hot for many more years to come.","8","17 December 2017"
"125","I've been watching this show for a very long time, and I'll have to say the shows newest episodes have begun to decline a little bit I can't argue with that, but it's still one of the best shows out there. The new episodes are much better than The Simpsons (I still love that show) new episodes, for The Simpsons, I have to say its without a doubt one of the best shows of the 90s but the new episodes just suck. Now getting on with South Park, it's true the new episodes are starting to suck, in my opinion ""jewpacabra"" is probably the worst South Park episode I've ever watched along with ""funnybot"" which is from season 15, and season 15 was awful compared to the previous seasons. So far season 16 is better than season 15 though. Now let's talk about the old episodes. The old episodes from the late 90s were alright, season 1 was pretty enjoyable, season 2 started off OK, than it had many crappy episodes, but ended pretty well the ""spookyfish"" episode which is one of my top 20 favourites. Season 3 was when South Park really started getting better, season 4 was also pretty good. Season 5 is when South Park really started to come to its own with my absolute favourite episode of South Park ""Scott Tenorman must die"" and many other great episodes like ""Butters very own episode"" and ""Kenny dies"". Moving on to season 6, season 6 is my 2nd favourite season of South Park, every single episode in that season had an excellent plot and ending,and there was an eight 10/10 episode streak in that season (In my opinion at least). Now for Season 7,season 7 is also an excellent season, not as good as 5 and 6 but still one of the best. Season 8 is is for sure my favourite season of South Park with great episodes classic episodes like ""Good Times With Weapons"" which is in my top 5 favourites, and in my opinion, every single episode in that season gets at least a 9/10 rating. Season 9 was also pretty damn good,many excellent episodes like ""die hippie die"" and ""trapped in a closet"". Moving on to season 10, season 10 is my another one of my favourite seasons of South Park partly because of ""Make Love Not Warcraft"" which is without a doubt one of my top 10 episodes but because of the 2 Cartoon Wars episodes where they make fun of Family Guy. The fact of the matter is nearly 1/2 of the South Park viewers also watch Family Guy, and for them to bash a show that half of South Park's viewers watches takes a lot of guts and South Park did it. Season 11 is another one of my favourites mainly because of the immaginationland episodes. Now season 12 and after everything started to go downhill, sure there are some great episodes like ""Canada On Strike"", 200/201, and a couple of others that are good, and season 12 was actually pretty good, same with season 14, but those seasons weren't very good, if the show started off with season 12 I'd give it an 8/10, but since seasons 3-11 were all excellent I give this show a 10/10. Below is my proper rating for each season. ****December 13, 2012 update**** The second half of season 16 was actually pretty good, 1 bad episode (Going Native), 3 really weird episodes that I enjoyed(Scause For Applause, Sarcastaball and Obama Wins), and 3 excellent 9/10 episodes (Raising The Bar, Insecurity, and A Nightmare On Facetime). So I change my 7.3 rating to 7.8. The second worst season of South Park, still not bad, we can only hope that the next season will be better.1.Season 8 (2004)9.9/102.Season 6 (2002)9.85/10 3.Season 11 (2007)9.80/104.Season 5 (2001)9.75/10 5.Season 10 (2006)9.55/106.Season 7 (2003)9.35/10 7.Season 9 (2005)9.25/10 8.Season 4 (2000)9.10/10 9.Season 3 (1999-2000)9.0/10 10.Season 14 (2010)8.5/1011.Season 13 (2009)8.20/10 12.Season 12 (2008)8.19/1013.Season 1 (1997-1998)8.1/10 14.Season 2 (1998-1999)8.0/1015.Season 16 (2012)7.8/10 16.Season 15 (2011)7.0/10","10","4 September 2012"
"126","This is hands down my favorite show of all time, which I hope says more about the show than about myself. I'm sure, on the surface, if you have never seen an episode, it looks juvenile and stupid. OK, it is little juvenile, but not stupid. I remember, I used to work with a girl who was uptight and even she said, ""If you've ever really watched an episode of South Park, it's actually pretty smart."" I mean the way they go about presenting their themes and messages is a little unconventional and even messed up. But it's always funny and always very current. Apparently they go in and create each episode last minute. Those two are comical geniuses because it always looks like they spent a ton of time on it. I mean I'm sure it isn't easy, but most writing teams would take weeks to come up with the absolutely hysterical witty stuff they come up with. I have seen almost every episode a million times and there are a lot of jokes and quotes that still make me crack up every time. I think it's now into its 17th season or something and I hope it will be around a lot longer. They really push the envelope when it comes to MPAA. I am surprised at what they can get away with. In fact I remember a few episodes had scene cut out or censored when the re-runs were picked up on regular TV. It revolves around 4 little fowl mouthed kids who live in South Park, CO and their families and friends and the rest of the town's people. They have really added a lot of characters to the show since it started back in 1997. I highly recommend you check out one of the many many episodes. I'm sure you will love them, just keep and open mind. The humor is pretty edgy.","10","30 July 2014"
"127","South Park is one of those show that make the other look bad. Cause nothing can really beat its humor. Before i used to find other cartoon funny, man but after watching this. You won't find the it funny no more.Yeah, i know. This show is full of swearing and can be extremely offensive at time; but the show is soooo indescribably funny. Not just that, Southpark also the only show on TV that speak out the whole truth that people might not want to hear - so you see, you might find that offensive. It is also the only cartoon with the deeper meaning and teaching (which no other show offer nowaday).And another thing, which i can guarantee: the jokes is very consistence throughout each episode and every season. Final Words: Southpark has loads to offer its viewer, more than you ever know.Rating: 9.9/10 (Grade: AAA+++)If You Not Agreed With My Comment Then: ""SCR*WED YOU GUYS, I'M GOING HOME""","10","23 March 2006"
"128","One of the most overrated, discarded carp carcuses ever to stay on television for eleven years, South Park is.....well suffice to say for now that's what it is. This review is not critical from a religiously moral standpoint<U+0096>perhaps somewhat from a secular moral standpoint<U+0097> but more of a simple dismissal of the alleged holiness that so many hapless, misguided, dead brains assign to it.First, the show's satirical bent is overflowed by the n<U+0096>viro sewer sludge of crude humour. Again, I'm certainly not offended in any way by the content, but rather just pointing out how much of a played out platitude this whole crudity thing is. I recall Monty Python doing this humour in the Meaning of Life and also many, many others before south park; those I enjoyed very much. For I like crude humour, the right kind and in the right doses, but South Park's reason for being is to wallow in the crudity. Granted there's a little originality I suppose to, say, growing a d<U+0097> on a mouse. I heard of the idea of growing organs on other parts of people's bodies; it's apparently a type of surgery that's been around since ancient Egypt. They give it the twist of being<U+0096>surprise!! What else!! A d<U+0097> (their other options were clitoris or prostate). Any satire on the show gets crowded out by this tiring crude aspect<U+0096>which continues on a terminating continuum of crudity started by many in the past, and merely pushed to more extremes along the continuum by Stone and Parker. But the crude humour in something classic like the Meaning of Life was somehow adult appealing; South park's humour is strictly juvenile<U+0096>the stuff that makes fourteen year olds guffaw out their moronic rotting teeth. I swear Stone and Parker would be the kind of idiots to laugh for days at images like Type O Negative's 1992 album cover for ""the origin of feces"". Apparently, they haven't left that mentality behind in the jr high smoking pit, it seems they would still laugh listlessly and mindlessly at such images. Aren't these guys middle aged men now? I think it's time to grow up boys.Some things just become extremely predictable in this show. Like the episode where Paris Hilton is enveloped by the S and M guy's rectum. On the surface it seems ""WHOA!"". But really, you would expect that. Yes, of course the gay, pan-sexual S and M guy is going to be the one with the biggest rectum to do something like swallow someone ""whole"" with it. Horray! You begin to know what to expect from this show after just a couple of viewings<U+0096>I mean in the way that the creators think that you won't expect, but anyone with a clear perception would. It's all low standards, low expectations, and low pangs in my gut<U+0096>not from any alleged disgusting imagery, but indeed from the platitude of it, and the annoyance that all they can do is think of more ways to slip and slide along the continuum of crudity.Another thing about the crudity is that it ends up the only thing that is often 'discussed'. I work with people who often talk about South Park (no, I currently don't work with the most enlightened people, I know). They talk about the mouse with the d---, or the rectum swallowing, or the guy who gave the aids virus to someone out of some petty revenge, or the lurid details of Mr. Garret's sex change, excrement coming out of people mouths, blah, blah, blah, yawn, yawn, yawn, and so on <U+0097>and then they leave break and go back to work with that dumb jaw hanging, clueless, zomped out, ragbag, mono expressions indicative (words with the d<U+0097> sound keep popping up (whoops) in this review for some strange coincidence) of the deadened, hollowed out, and sad existence that they surely must lead (and no I don't feel spite for my co-workers<U+0096>actually feel very sad for them<U+0096>it's depressing being around them<U+0096>if only they could open their minds a little bit but leave the sluice gates selective so that this south park sludge can be filtered out. My take anyway<U+0096>hee hee).This show has long run its course. It was good when it first came on when I was a jr. high school student, but it has been going on far too long, and far too many people are left guffawing mindlessly at the stupid, supposedly disgusting, actually tired, imagery, missing what paltry satire there is completely, and then leaving with an instant expression of doom, hatred, and contempt on their visages, with those ill feelings being passed on to the rest of humanity. Perhaps it is because after eleven years of staring at horrible construction paper cutout animation, people have come to mimic the look, and look blander and deader and less animated than the show itself. That's perhaps the most effect this show has on people<U+0096>and subconsciously, it makes them angry.Let this show go far south and park itself deeply under thick layers of ice somewhere around Antarctica. Hey, maybe it could even get some new material. Let's see, a penguin people pull fish out of another penguin's vagina or anus, then eviscerates the fish to eat it, but discover the fish have excrement instead of guts. Then tack on some cheap satire about the whiny people who complain that their food is being grown in kiln dust and raw sewage or something. It took no time for me to think that up<U+0096>and that's about the time it takes to think up material for South Park. Yuk, Yuk, Yuk.","1","13 August 2008"
"129","Trey Parker and Matt Stone must be rolling in money now - and they deserve to be. This is one of the greatest television creations in the past decade. The animation is terrible, but it sets the mood for what is probably the most sexually crude cartoon allowed on TV.

The plots in each episodes are interesting, and the characters are funny and likable. Unfortunately, lots of people don't like it because of how inappropriate and vulgar it is, even though what ''South Park'' says in the show is completely accurate. Sadly, people won't learn to love ''South Park'' because they're sensitive to religious beliefs or vulnerable to dark humor.

"132","I loved the show since 20 years ago. It's been amazing since 1997. The satirical views are original and realistic about how much life sucks. Like Family Guy this show is all about bringing controversial subjects but well-written topics to the point out how people in real time are a bunch of boring hypocrites who don't have a clue about being funny. It's a tragedy of having butthurt idiots trying to control television by expressing how offensive adult humor is. Really only pansies like the fcc, ptc and other reviewers who despises shows like South Park & Family Guy have the crappiest sense of humor and morals. Go South Park and Family Guy the two most popular shows of all-time. I love both shows equally. Both are crazy but brilliant and interesting. Screw the system!","10","29 October 2016"

"134","Ah South Park! My sister would always watch this show religiously and rant on how ""funny"" and ""clever"" this show was. I decided to watch ""South Park"" myself a few times, and man, I have to disagree sis! I have seen better satires and gross-out humor.No, I am not a bigot against bad animation, in fact, I think the character designs are quite interesting (much better than modern day Disney crap IMO), but even interesting character designs cannot save this cartoon from being a cough and yawn fest! The humor is nothing more than stale cussing, offensiveness and flying, talking turds. Sure, I do not mind shock value here and there, but there must be a reason behind it. At least the old Looney Tunes shorts had a reason behind some of the ""stereotypical"" humor, but ""South Park"" has no real reason for shock value, hense, it is Shock Value for the hell of it, which is indeed quite boring and pointless. And sad thing is, alot of shows are starting to mimic these ""South Park"" qualities too, such as the recent ""Simpson"" episode and ""The Family Guy"".
If you want good satire humor, watch ""Os Trapehlos"" or ""Monty Python"". Or even yet, watch some old ""Looney Tunes"" shorts.If you want good gross out variety, watch ""Ren and Stimpy"" (Ren y Estimpo).If you want mind numbingly bad swill, watch ""South Park"" (or what I call it, ""Suckage Bark"").",NA,"28 April 2003"

"136","I used to be a self confessed fan of this show. It was quite easy with every other year seven kid obsessed with it. Perceived as harmless fun, no doubt, due to the fact of swearing in excess and envelope pushing issues.Two years on, I cringe in embarrassment that for eight months, there was nothing better on T.V than this forsaken cartoon more interested in offending people and contributing to the T.V wasteland. Obviously I was in desperation about the state of the weekly line up, but I can hardly believe that this of all shows was the one I sought solace in.
Although I have to admit that ""South Park"" is a ground breaker of cartoons as far as things go, I would hardly think that every other cartoon on the air should follow suit. Funny and intelligent toons do not necessarily have to resort to toilet humour and cheapness to get an audience. There are some clever ideas outside the easy to offend bracket, but the creator's egos are larger than the small Colorado town that they're trying to create.
This proves that excessive commercialisation, merchandising in unrealistic amounts and even a feature film cannot always save the sinking ship when it is on the way down.",NA,"24 January 2000"

They've become complete parodies of themselves; now they're over-woke, illogical, performing idiotic mental gymnastics to adhere to a ridiculous narrative - These aren't the same two genius beings that were so edgy and insightful and hilarious for so many years. The show feels blackmailed, cucked, pocketed, written by liars serving some well cloaked master. I feel bad for them. I loved those guys. They used to be the ones we could count on to speak truth to power, no matter who it was.","1","16 March 2021"
"139","When South Park first started it was unique, controversial and very great. It is important to remember that the use of Internet was very limited back in 1997 so South Park had a unique position in which they could use to entertain with their sarcasm, satire and criticism of society. The first 5 seasons or so of South Park was TV history.But over the years, they no longer had the same unique position in society. Internet and easier video creating programs have made all sort of amateurish satire and extreme parodies readily available to view on YouTube, blogs etc..., so the unique selling point evaporated throughout roughly the 2004-2010 era.This meant South Park had to reinvent themselves. Unfortunately they did so by just becoming more extreme and put more and more focus on temporary, teenage trends while still at the same time trying to hold the initial setup at bay (so they did not become a Robot Chicken type of show (not that it would had been bad necessarily)). This effectively reduced their intended audience from more or less anyone to mostly boys between the age of 14 and 22.So the problem with South Park now is that their sarcastic disclaimer at the start which says among other things: ""The following program contains coarse language and due to its content it should not be viewed by anyone"" is embarrassingly accurate nowadays. Due to the violence, suggestive dialogue and language it is not suitable for kids. However on the other hand, a lot of the themes, humour and cultural references that the shows makes over the last 7-8 seasons are mainly directed for very young adults / teenagers.The most common misconception in my opinion about this show, is that it is misunderstood. Of course that can be true to a certain extent for certain individuals. But for the most part, I would argue that people get it. They get what South Park wants to do. It's just that it's no longer original nor attracts the adult audience as it once did.If South Park wants to survive I think they need to seriously reduce the amount of temporary pop-cultural trends they use, often in a way that make entire episode one big ""huh?"" for people that may not have heard or care much about such a reference.South Park needs to realize that their platform are no longer suitable as a way to be the most extreme of everything. Instead they should focus on making great comedy with a lot of satirical plots and indirect scepticism of society. If they do, they might just get the audience that are in the 30s and 40s back...","5","26 March 2015"

"141","South Park is some of the greatest and most hilarious satire that you will ever find. On shows like Family Guy, the creators will be brave, but there are lengths that even THEY will not sink to. The same cannot be said for South Park. Trey Parker and Matt Stone have no fear and they are not afraid of offending people. Many people have complained about this show and how it promotes low moral values, but that doesn't stop Parker and Stone. They just keep supplying we who appreciate and understand the true purpose of the show with more and more clever comedy.A slew of negative comments have been thrown at the show the past twelve years, and people have called it racist among other things for their satire of other nations. But in truth, none of that is fair, because absolutely nobody is exempt from the wrath of South Park. It's not like they are focusing on a single thing to ridicule and constantly bombard it with insults. Foreign countries, Schools, Sexual Orientations, and even Religions get a hunk of the South Park pie.And it's not just the satire of the show that makes it so great. Each of the characters are unique and iconic in their own way. Stan and Kyle are both pretty normal, but they both have their funny moments. And then there is Kenny, a boy whose mouth is covered by the tightened hood of his jacket, and he mutters things that come out unclear and barely understandable, and most of them are obscenities that the show would not be able to get away with if another character said it loud and clear. And how could you forget Cartman, probably the world's funniest fat person, even surpassing Peter Griffin, Gabriel Iglesias, Ralphie May, or anyone else you can think of. He has an exceptionally short temper and he is never afraid to say what's on his mind. Even his voice is hilarious. The small and seemingly innocent Butters appears often as well.But probably the most unique characters are the minor ones, most of them the boys' teachers. You have Mr. Mackey, the teacher with the odd voice that is constantly saying ""M'kay."" There's Mr. Garrison, a seemingly normal male teacher who eventually turns into a female, and lots of others that would take much too long to mention.So be open-minded, and enjoy the amazing art of South Park.","10","24 June 2009"

I think some of jokes and quotes from will go down in history as some of the funniest of all time but there are many, many better ones.

It's just another Simpsons wannabe, infact to mention it in the same breath as the Simpsons is a travesty, everything good about the Simpsons is lacking here.What episodes I have had the misfortune to see are always about masturbation, circumcision, excrement, urine or some other filth. Unfortunately with people today (and not just children) that's guarenteed to be funny & for reasons I can't even be bothered to work out.I refer to 2 episodes as proof, one where the word s**t is used about 30 times in 10 seconds & one where a school bus crashes and a painfully annoying teacher gets off the bus for help & ends up in a talent contest. After about 5 minutes of her & that her screaming had broken glass in the house I was in, everyone I was with just looked at each other & in unison said ""turn this crap off"".I don't generally like filth & smut as comedy but occasionally I can enjoy it. Unfortunately, this isn't just crude, it's not funny. Nothing on the aforementioned subjects are.For many years I claimed the writers/creators would have been like the 2 kids at the back of the class who giggle through the sex lessons making childish remarks & smirks for attention. I have however, seen Baseketball which apparently they starred in & wrote.

"145","South Park is absolutely hilarious and can be absolutely disgusting and satirical in the best way possible. The unique animation also sets this show against other animated series. The individual stories are so crazy and outlandish while also being hysterical! One episode in particular is about a group of Christmas critters in the woods that want to bring back the antichrist, another is when Satan has a sweet 16 party at a hotel while the kids summon biggie smalls through a mirror and that's just the beginning.

"147","Dear Friends, I have been a dedicated South Park fan since the third season when my area finally got Comedy Central. Until then, I had only heard about the show and seen T-shirts in stores around town. Eleven years later I can honestly say that this show has changed my life and opened my eyes more than any other in television history. It is easily the most intelligent, daring, and out-right hilarious show of all time. It has been imitated and parodied and referenced millions of times since its inception and has amassed one of the most devoted followings of any pop culture creation ever. The plots are brilliant, the characters well-developed, the writing and direction outstanding. Sure, not every single episode is perfect, but most come pretty close. The amount of time, thought and ingenuity that goes into each twenty-two minute spectacle is mind-blowing. After fourteen years, including over 200 episodes and one fantastic movie, South Park remains consistently fresh and original.In my experience, most people who watch South Park, even those who love it, fail to truly understand by what the show is. While at first glance it appears to be nothing more than a show about some potty-mouthed children, it is far more. South Park makes bold, unapologetic statements on ideas and events using accurate information and turns the inherent contradictions or absurdity of those ideas and events into powerful jokes. That is the genius of the show. There has been dispute among fans and critics about there being obvious political agendas at the core of many episodes and that this interferes with the entertainment value. In my opinion, this is simply an example of the show's depth and enhances its entertainment value. Indeed there are plenty of messages the writers hope will be received by the viewers, but that is precisely what elevates the show above mediocrity. South Park does not pander to popular opinion, nor does it set its sights on refuting popular opinion. It is neither conformist nor anti-conformist. It is truly non-conformist, meaning that sometimes it agrees with the masses and sometimes it does not. That is what a true rebel does. Rebels do not vilify or vandalize, they think. They come to their own conclusions regardless of what is accepted as correct. The creators of South Park are genuine rebels, and this is why they and by extension their show deserve the highest respect. South Park makes fun of everything and everyone. It doesn't play favorites and no person, country, culture, company, religion, trend, tragedy, or technology is immune. I think that is beautiful.The show is centered around the lives of four young boys who live in a small mountain town in Colorado called South Park, and it is through their eyes which we view the world. Stan is the leader, Kyle is the conscience, Cartman is the villain, and Kenny is the enigma. In the average television show, there are rarely paradigm shifts, changes in perspective or real surprises. This show offers all three on a regular basis. In the typical show, everyone has a role and those roles are to be counted on no matter what the situation. In this respect as well, South Park is unique. Although the main characters do have basic attributes, their actions are not predictable. Sometimes Stan dodges his leadership, sometimes Kyle does the wrong thing, sometimes Cartman does the right thing, and sometimes Kenny seems almost normal. This makes the show more realistic and reflects the fact that children's personalities are plastic, not rigid. And because we see things from their eyes, the show is about much more than just them. It is about their parents, siblings, classmates, teachers, and various others who live and work in the town. The show's regulars are anything but stereotypes and the stereotypes we do encounter are absolutely deliberate and stretched to the limit. They are all interesting characters, from sexually-confused 4th grade teacher Mr. Garrison to dumber-than-dirt policeman Officer Barbrady. Another level of characterization can be seen by the arbitrary inclusion of both imaginary and historic characters. Christian icons Jesus Christ and Satan have appeared on the show, as have impossible characters like Mr. Hankey the Christmas poo and Towelie the drug-addicted genetically engineered towel.There is very little intelligent programming today. Maybe there never really was. Most shows of all kinds come and go without leaving any lasting impression. Their structure or storyline gets stale and before you know it the show is canceled. No surprise and no big loss. They are not remembered because they have made no difference in the world. South Park is different. It will be remembered long after its series finale because it has changed the world. It has pushed the boundaries of what is allowed on television more times and in more ways than any other show in history. It is filled with sharp dialogue and clever catch phrases that are recited by millions of fans all over the world. It is not afraid to confront any issue, poke fun at any celebrity, or parody any movie or book. Do not listen to those who complain about the show being immature, poorly drawn, or just plain stupid. It is smarter, gustier, and more original than any two shows of this generation or any. South Park is the best, pure and simple. The conclusion of this past season only proves that the creators are just as ingenious and imaginative as ever. Trust me, South Park will live on.Sincerely, A Fan","10","29 November 2010"

"149","Easily one of the funniest and most wrong shows on television. And by wrong i mean so right and brilliant and satirical and beyond funny. No one is safe from being made fun of on this show and if you are someone who is very famous and in the spotlight fasten your seat belts. Basically anything or anyone in the news will be on the show fairly soon.This phenomenal show is truly underrated as it is extremely funny with subject matter that is right in line with the US and world at the time. I am a centrist slightly leaning left gay democrat and whenever they hit my demographic (and they hit every demographic hard) I am laughing hysterically in tears. Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride was one of the first episodes I watched and in the words of one of the characters in the South Park Movie I said laughing ""where do they come up with this stuff"".If you don't like this kind of razor sharp humor, satire, and self parody or in any other way offended by it, watch something else.Thank you Matt Parker and Trey Stone for your courage, talent, and phenomenal unique vision.","10","13 March 2019"

"151","I was a huge fan of this show from its debut when I was 15 until I was in my mid 20's. I have only very casually watched for the last decade or so, but recently I've found myself unintentionally almost binging it on HBO Max (no commercials and no bleeped out foul language definitely makes the experience more enjoyable). I have come to the surreal and ridiculous realization that this is probably the most grounded and intelligent show on television. The way each episode takes a real current event and hilariously expose how petty and silly the topic is. The show has such a awareness of how so many things in this country are totally nonsensical. They never take any shot at anyone or anything that doesn't have a basis in reality. This show understands and reveals the irrational state of our society better than anything else on television. There are very serious shows that clearly don't have half the grasp of events as a vulgar poorly produced CARTOON. That is seriously tragic. But I digress, I now have a completely different view of the show and absolutely love their satirical presentation of the sad state of things. Also, they will never become stale like other storyline driven shows because the lunatics running things consistently give the writers gold content.","10","2 August 2021"
"152","The show has programed 169 episodes and has signed on to at least do another 54. Unlike some other shows, this has remained fresh and exiting and like previous shows like The Simpsons and Family Guy I will do a count on all the seasons separately and you will see what I have thought of the show as it has progressed.Season 1: The show came out being advertised as the new show that kids cannot watch and it started out great, it may not have had great computer animation for the time (The first episode being cut paper strips) but the writers thought of a new idea, ""Lets be offensive and funny"" well they did it brilliantly and early on was showing signs of an extremely long run. I rate this season 78%.Season 2: Great season, one of the best the season messed with and crossed the boundary's in the wacky way it does and showcased some other talents such as its ability to make fun of any celebrity they feel like. This season has made me laugh numerous times and watching them again still brings a smile to my face. I rate this season 83%.Season 3: The best season of them all, the show crossed the boundary many times and you just felt that the show had reached the tip of its iceberg and that the show could go on for another 10 years and still remain funny. I rate this season 92%.Season 4: This season was crossing the border, the show was not as wacky and its humour focused on celebrity's being parodied, however the season was funny and really enjoyable and maybe I only compare this to season 3 making it seem less funny but there was something here that seemed less funny. I rate this season 77%.Season 5: I have not seen all of this series but the half I have seen was extremely funny and with the times. The show was offensive but in the good way and South Park's wacky ness combining the offensive ness made something special again and showcased what season 4 did not. I rate this season 89%.Season 6: This season was so damn OFFENSIVE!. The show was offensive the whole time and they never let down. The humour was funny though and the episodes wholly enjoyable and in fact introduced 3 of the best episodes(The Proffesor Chaos episodes) of the whole series. I rate this season 85%.Season 7: This season was very funny and the episodes played out better then any other season, the show had its mediocrity's but the show was still enjoyable and worth while to sit down and enjoy on a nice night. I rate this season 81%.Season 8: Now this season was funny, showcasing hilarious episodes and some just funny ones the show was creative and witty and this season kept me wanting to come back for more. I rate this season 83%.Season 9: This season was good, very offensive and very weird (Episodes like Die Hippy die and Best Friends Ever) but the show was still good and I liked it and no episodes were unbearable. I rate it 78%.Season 10: Not great, just there to offend and not much else and I was not impressed, episodes dragged on and the episodes did not have enough humour to get them over the line. Some episodes were funny though like Cartoon wars, ManBearPig and Stanleys cup but apart from that I was not pleased. I rate this season 63% purely for the three previously mentioned episodes.Season 11: Great, Great, Great and word cannot express the joy I am feeling that South Park had returned to its hilarious ways. Imationland trilogy is the best thing I have ever seen and overall the season kicked arse. I rate this season 91%.Season 12: This is an edit since Season 12 just finished. Anyway this season was not as good as the other seasons. Some episodes just failed and this season had the first episode in the history of the show I have really not liked. Of course it did have some great oness though like. Over Logging, the two part Pandemic episode and the Elementary School Musical episodes being hilarious. I rate this 70%Season 13: Well, we'll just have to wait and see now wont we.Overall the show is clever and deserves recognition and apart from season 10 every season has been some clever s!it.I overall (Using a calculator to count up my average of course) rate this series a fair 82.5%.Seasons over Average: Season 2, Season 3. Season 5, Season 6, Season 8, Season 11 Seasons On Average: N.A.DSeasons under Average: Season 1, Season 4, Season 7, Season 9, Season 10, Season 12Seasons O.A: 7 Seasons IMOA: 0 Seasons UNDERA: 5","9","12 December 2007"
"153","Propaganda is a term that's bandied around a lot but I think in South Park's case it's a fair term. The stories are almost all about some real world political or social issue and so the stories are only a means to an end of promoting ideas, as if we all haven't heard the arguments for this, that and the other for the last few hundred years anyway so on that level it's filler basically. Mercilessly and insensitively mocking religion, thinking ginger people don't have souls (even though it was black haired people who carried out almost every atrocity in history and I have never come across a red haired person prejudiced against dark haired people) and being shocking just to grab attention rather than to hammer home a message in an effective way plus thinking that just because you've mocked something that means it's automatically wrong and funny are all common ideas on the internet and guess where these foul ideas came from? If you said anything other than South Park then guess again. Sure there were some good ideas in there (civil partnerships are indeed a convenient way for wishy washy politicians to get out of taking a position on gay marriage, you can't just shuffle the homeless from one city to another) but also some not so good ones; (they accuse the anti- tobacco people of making up research even though it's been well documented that the tobacco industry spent decades and millions of dollars doing faulty research). As is common in the west people say they're not religious but only ever criticize Christianity. Now I don't know about other people but if I were an atheist I'd find the idea of one, human-looking God far more rational than multiple ones with animal heads. The politics and the politics alone are what makes this show popular; even a solid defense of authoritarianism (if that were possible) would never have been as popular in a country like America or a place like the internet.","1","24 May 2013"

"155","There is not really much you can say about ""South Park"" anymore. Everybody knows it, most people love it. I simply adore it. Although the show gets a lot of praise, I still think it's underestimated just how subversive it is. Nobody else dares to speak the truth and uncover plain stupidity as directly on TV as Trey Parker and Matt Stone do. Their creativity seems infinite and their eye for the little absurdities in our everyday lives is always open and very observant. Whereas ""The Simpsons"" have run out of steam somewhere around season 8, ""South Park"" has been going strong now for 11 (!!) seasons and there's no decline in quality in sight, making this the undisputed king of all animated satire shows of our time.I wasn't always a fan of Cartman and his friends. When the show started I thought it was too much of a Simpsons rip-off, but, boy, have I been disabused. Firstly, Parker and Stone freely admitted in an episode that they're heavily influenced by Matt Groening's show and secondly, they soon found their very own voice to address issues, their own totally original kind of humor. It's often rude, vulgar and silly, which may turn some people off, but in true Monty Python-fashion every joke is founded on a truly clever idea and has a deeper subtext that might go over some people's heads.What I find really hard to believe is that Parker and Stone develop the scripts for each episode only one week in advance and that's just insane. The term ""genius"" is overused in today's society, but I think these two very well may be called just that. They breathe social and political satire, how else could you explain their quick reaction time to recent occurrences. It looks as if they could continue on such a high level for many more years and I sure hope they will.","10","20 October 2007"
"156","I first heard of 'South Park' when I was 11 and saw some of its merchandise in a shop. My mum warned me it was a rude cartoon and she was right, which is one of the reasons I don't like it. Unfortunately when I was 12, I shared a room with my sister who was three and a half years younger than me and she insisted on watching 'South Park' in our bedroom (she even wanted to disguise herself as a 15-year-old so that she could see the movie!) so I had to put up with the many profanities it contained (that my mum warned us to ignore), Kenny dying in just about every episode but coming back to life and pure crudeness whenever she watched it. Nowadays I have a housemate who likes this show and still I had to put up with him watching it when we were in the lounge, although one episode he watched turned out to be pretty decent because it paid homage to 'The Simpsons' and other animated sitcoms by having lookalikes of Bart Simpson and probably the Griffin family from 'Family Guy.'Besides the swearing, Kenny's deaths and crudeness, the other thing I didn't like about 'South Park' was the way the characters walked - it looks as if they had their legs and feet stuck together! Mind you I quite like its cut-out animation look and I found Cartman's rendition of 'Poker Face' funny as well as part of the episode where Stan wants to join a boy band against his father's wishes (the part where Ike is auditioning and whenever one of the main four as a judge says, ""Next one,"" Ike sings another song instead of making way for the next auditionee and Wendy sings a song full of word play is the funniest part) that happened to be on when I was flicking through the channels one night. Another episode that stands out is the one where Wendy and her friends play Truth or Dare but that's the only part I can remember from that episode when my sister watched it.Overall this is a mostly rubbish cartoon that has an interesting animation technique but otherwise has very few redeeming qualities. 3/10.","3","22 September 2013"
"157","This show, not ""The Daily Show,"" not Dave Chappelle or ""The Colbert Report"" or the putrid ""Mad TV"" reruns, IS the big money for Comedy Central; dare I say, it is the glue keeping this channel from falling apart. It is, coincidentally, also the funniest program.Matt and Trey have crafted a highly amusing adult cartoon that is always outrageous but also clever and original. These two men seem to have a keen eye into the minds of all humans, whether child or adult. Kids REALLY DO talk and behave like the Fab Four on ""South Park,"" albeit probably in junior high rather than grammar school. Unlike other delicious gross-out cartoons, like ""Ren and Stimpy"" and ""Beavis and Butthead,"" ""South Park"" does make an explicit and conspicuous attempt at satiric commentary. Unfortunately, this is Matt and Trey's weakness. They focus too much on news-of-the-week stories, with explicit messages parroted by one of the kids (usually Kyle). It gets old and preachy really fast. Still, while Matt and Trey try to shove their view of mankind down our throats, they at least make extremely funny jokes along the way, delivered by some of the most memorable characters in all of toondom (yes, I mean it!). I can say with a straight face that Eric Cartman is as durable a cartoon legend as Donald Duck or Homer Simpson; he is that much a symbol of the worst aspects of the human character, which Matt and Trey feel we all possess. Their messages are really preachy (which, unfortunately, keeps this show from being a flawless classic), but they exist in a well-developed milieu of misanthropic debauchery known as South Park, a stand-in for the foibles of mankind as well-cultivated as Dogpatch, Okeefonokee, or Springfield. With my academic horse manure out of the way (I have no idea what I just wrote), this show has stayed funny throughout the course of nearly ten years, something that cannot be said for ""King of the Hill"" or even ""The Simpsons."" Season Ten has retained much of the witty humor that has characterized some of the latter seasons of ""South Park."" Matt and Trey may be preachy, but I like this show because they also know how to have fun and enjoy themselves. While not lampooning mankind, these two jokers love to parody any show they enjoy on cable, such as ""Dog the Bounty Hunter"", the nanny shows, or any MTV show with hedonistic rappers or teenage girls. Couch potatoes and sociology professor alike can find something to love about ""South Park."" Please watch this very funny and smart show.","8","27 October 2006"
"158","This is my favorite show in the world. It's fresh, funny, clever and awesome. Cartman rulz! A 10 (or 100 heh)! Rated TV-MA for language and graphic violence.",NA,"19 January 1999"
"159","I suppose it's considered unhip to begin by saying that the animation is bad?Well, I will anyway.  -Look, in this kind of show I neither expect nor desire Disney-style character animation.  Cheap and simple is fine.  But it's possible to be cheap and simple and nonetheless witty in one way or another.  The trouble here is that the drawings are simply bad.  That's it. It's a kind of postmodern joke: everything is ineptly done, but - ha ha! - it's bad on purpose.  Such jokes get old fast.Theoretically much about ""South Park"" is funny.  A central character called Kenny is killed off every week, and yet every episode he's back again, as if the previous death hadn't occurred.  It sounds such a great idea.  In practice it's a lead balloon.  The children are all horrible creatures, like real children: a wonderful idea, but they never quite attain the status of characters, so the idea is lost.  It's as if the makers just collected a bunch of ideas and jokes they wanted to use, and then assumed that the execution (in practice, someone sitting in front of a computer much like mine with a simple cut-and-paste graphics program) would take care of itself.  The resulting lack of humour is painful; like watching someone who can barely put a sentence together tell a long and involved anecdote.And much isn't funny even in theory - although I suppose the kind of people who three decades ago watched poor British comedies and chortled every time the word ""knockers"" was used, would think otherwise.  On the whole I think the British comedies were better.",NA,"30 June 1999"
"160","In times of mass media dominance and mind making machines forged by huge corporations it is quite important to have a counterparts challenging the created common standards.South Park may be obscene, politically incorrect, exaggerated or even perverted, but in the end is one thing: Honest! Frankly I don't agree with most of the ways certain issues are being dealt with in this show but I have to give credit for the fact that it delivers aspects worth looking at on a lot of topics. Matt Stone and Trey Parker dare to ask subtle questions which are truly worth being asked, and even more, they base a lot of their thoughts on important human emotions which have a justified reason to be explored. In a society of terrorism, (pseudo)-tolerated religions and homosexuality, racism, stupidity and mistrust towards governments all that people have left is objectivity. South Park doesn't just try to suggest an opinion, it goes even further, it presents both sides of the problem and leaves the opinion mostly to the viewer. This is precious in a lot ways, for one it offers choices, a point that should really be considered in times of an opinion controlled by the mass media. In another way it forces the audience to approach important issues from both colliding sides. Furthermore it dares, a fact that may chase many people away, but in the end it's those people who don't dare to confront themselves with the real issue itself. So in another way it distinguishes the cowards from the (real) brave.South Park sympathizes with the idea of self esteem, openness and thought, and by exaggerating it I believe they do a very good of illustrating those points. Let's face it, we are being lead by MTV, VH1, CNN and Fox News... People don't know who to trust anymore, all becomes a show of ""who's more trustworthy?"", a commercial, a campaign, a fake... Real intentions are being blurred by phony commitments and promises, so why not have a look on the side? This show may be very offensive to a lot of people, I respect that, but if people just let go of prejudices and fake beliefs, South Park offers a perfect interface for global cultural acceptance and understanding. In some way it's stupid, but on the other it tries to make you realize how stupid reality even is. Very interesting!","8","13 December 2006"
"161","Trey and Matt want to take themselves seriously, at times. And it seems many of their fans do, as well. But they can't manage it. The pair always have at the ready an infantile stimulus when the writer's block sets in. There is always the self-referential 'Terrance and Phillip' cartoon within the cartoon, but which unlike the Itchy and Scratchy complaint by the Simpson's writers, is not here presented as something to be avoided. They play with their feces, in a somewhat recurring family of characters which literally were anthropomorphized excrement, with mouths so they could talk, which some felt was the 'shark-jumping' moment for the show. Other characters attempt to defecate out of their mouths, perhaps a not so vague self-reference to the sort of thing coming from the writers. That's pretty much the level of the show, South Park. It just never escapes that, from mockery in 'Bloody Mary' to the offensive vulgarity mumbled by the Kenny character, right past the censors. It's shock value for its own sake, in the guise of an almost Peanuts-world of wide-eyed, round-headed toddlers.The one thing on which they have prided themselves is timeliness. With their cutout animation, now computer driven though it may be, and requiring really just a sequence of lip movements and eye expressions, they have occasionally been able to make some vaguely incoherent comment on current issues, within days, or hours, of the event. But there are no real details. There is at best just outright misrepresentation of events. They end up wanting to say - that's . . stuff. It's just all . . stuff. Stuff it will be. And golly can't we all just get along? Profound. And then they'll vomit, engage in sex talk, Kenny says something, or else they'll show something concerning the toilet bowl. It's also how religions are boiled down, as well - can't we all just get along - Islam and Judaism are basically just the same anyhow, etc. Why can't everyone just live in peace, and misrepresent each other's religion? It's all a joke, anyway. That's the 'serious-side' of South Park. That's the cutting-edge wisdom on current events.Without that, what might make the show interesting are the trials and tribs of the five or six or more main characters. The infantilism and scatological humor, forced onto a make-believe world of children by aging adults, does make the thing seem creepy. But if you ignore that context, and helped by the fact that these are wide-eyed 'Charlie-Brown' characters, and not the more thuggish and creepy incarnations to be found if they were drawn in more lifelike fashion, as suggested by some artwork at the wikipedia site on this from one of the latest episodes, then there remains Eric Cartman, who might have been better given the name, Stan. He's a wily survivor. He's absurdly bright. He's an 8-year old child, and so self-absorbed. He despises the PC of his Colorado world, but only from the selfish point of view of a brat, essentially. And as the episodes ticked by, Trey and Matt made him so loathsome that any earlier sympathies might have been destroyed. He transforms from indifferent friend into a dangerous enemy. In the early years, Cartman might save the day. He might coin a catch phrase. He might be adorable and pitied, even, as his erstwhile girlfriend says they may only be friends, as little Eric shuffles off screen right. Again, this is helped by the babyish talk, the attempts to be cute with little catch-phrases, and again the round-headed, wide-eyed appearance of his cutout. I think the writers imagine Cartman to be much more along the lines of, Chucky, the doll from the horror films. Cartman's friends/enemies are Stan Marsh and Kyle Brof-something, themselves best friends, who also struggle to survive the adult recklessness in this Colorado, but without quite Cartman's skill (these two never get their own amusement park, or lead the town in a Dixiecrat recreation of the Civil War - but Cartman does, etc). Even more oppressed is little Butters, last name Stotch (as in . . ), who is both friend and object of ridicule, a happy-go-lucky and supremely honest 'dweeb', discovering in his own 'Butters Show' episode that his father is a bath-house frequenting homosexual and his mother's means of coping with that was to attempt to drown little Butters in her car (failing at it, obviously).And that leads to this odd thread in that Trey and Matt keep trying to come out of the closet, it seems, by premising more than a few episodes upon some homosexual subplot. Either Kyle's Dad masturbates with another father, or the soul of Saddam Hussein is 'doing it' with Satan himself, in hell, there's Butter's Dad, or a 'gay guy' mysteriously appears and disappears, or the freakish puppet-toting teacher, Garrison, has to discover his own homosexuality, all the while the kids deride this and that by calling it, gay. Quite a conflicted group of writers, at the very least.And the last oddity in this dancing cutout cartoon is named, Kenny. He is supposed to be a poorly adjusted 'redneck', basically, who mumbles epithets that the censors aren't supposed to get. But the gimmick is, or was, that Kenny is killed. He dies in every episode, or at least did in the early years. Then he'd return in the next episode, and be killed once more (typically by being crushed).In sum, the boys/characters are the show, and are genuinely engaging for a time, inspiring parodies and the like, but then fall off into nothingness, and depravity. People prefer Charlie Brown - not a drunken Chucky, cursing and defecating. The very people who should not view this, young children, can be the very ones to whom it appeals. So the reevaluation, or antithesis, phase for people first seeing this show must be rough. Popular for the first few months. Then suddenly no one wants to talk about it.",NA,"31 October 2006"

This isn't one of those times. If that's what they want to do fine, but just know it's not funny if you don't agree with their views.Yeah, yeah.

"166","... it improves with age. South Park has been one of the dominate adult cartoons to hit the world, along with the Simpsons and Family Guy; but somehow the quality of South Park improved, not decreased. The Simpsons and Family Guy are in the shadow of their former glories.South Park came to our screen in 1997 as a very rude, crude and funny show. The show focus on four friends, Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny, all growing up in a mountain town in Colorado. They are very fouled mouthed, who end up getting into a lot of adventures, ranging from fighting battles between heaven and hell, stopping alien abductions, to fighting monsters. There is nothing the show will not do. South Park does use crude humour, from swearing to toilet humour, which can appeal to the child within all of us. But South Park has very clever writers, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. They add many social, political and cultural gags and satire, making the show both more intelligence, and one of it's great strengths is South Park's ability to keep the show contemporary. One on my favourite episodes is The Passion of the Jew where they rip a hole in the fans of the Passion of the Christ, and Mel Gibson. When the show started to age the writers had to mature the show's approach, and not use cheap laughs like killing Kenny every time. They had to be a social commentary, but that ended up increasing the humour to a more intelligence audience. South Park's philosophy has been called South Park Republicanism, where they are socially liberal and fiscally conservative. If the Republican party was really like that I would support then being an complete Democracy (despite the fact I'm not American).As well as great humour based on grand themes, one of the other key elements is the characters, Stan and Kyle both fairly normal and sympathetic characters, Cartman, an obese, anti-Semistic, racist (and the best character in the show), and Kenny who is a cannon fodder in the early seasons. There are also good supporting characters like Butters who is delightfully naive, Chef, the sex obsessed school chef and talented singer (he was voiced by Issac Haynes), to characters like Mr/Mrs Grayson. There is a great relationship between Cartman and Kyle, with Cartman ripping on Kyle for being Jewish, whilst Kyle fights back by reminding Cartman is a fat idiot. Cartman is evil and would be a really dislikable character in real live, but is so appealing to watch in the context of the show because he shows the worst parts of humanity.Essential viewing.","9","21 December 2009"
"167","Used to be the best cartoon with this kind of humor.
But with the new principal, the presidential thing with mr Garrison and such it went from 9 to 6, with the last seasons being 4/10.","6","25 February 2019"
"168","Trey Parker and Matt Stone do that. They like doing it. I like that they like doing that. They like that I like that they like doing it. That is what South Park is all about. People are so offended by what they say that they talk about it. They want you to get mad so that you will discuss things and formulate your own opinion. You can tell, because it is people like Michael Jackson, Mel Gibson, and Tom Cruise, people who pretend to be something they are not or who try to get you to join their cult, that annoy them the most. But what makes the show great is that it spoofs that type of show, the one with a moral, while being a show that promotes tolerance. All of the characters on the show live together in relative harmony, no matter who they are, as long as they are basically good people. I think the one thing that holds this show together is the fact that four kids are the main characters. It explains away a lot of the childish humor that wouldn't work with them being adults. The effect is that you have a show about four people trying to figure out what it's all about masked by some outrageously crude humor so that the medicine goes down easy. Genius.",NA,"1 May 2006"
"169","I used to like this show. It was hilarious, and had some really hilarious episodes that I can remember rolling around the floor from laughing. That was then....But now, the show has gone downhill FAST, and it doesn't seem to stop. It's now contracted ""Simpsons"" syndrome (in which a show loses its charm and goes downhill, and the show just keeps going.). It no longer is funny, and it's painful to watch now. This past season sucked, and the one before sucked too. Things only got worse when they killed Kenny permenantly (A big Mistake there Matt n Trey), and had Butters as the 4th kid temporarilly. The episodes have been getting worse, and worse, and it doesn't seem to get any better.Frankly, I think it's time for Matt, and Trey to take this old horse to the pasture, and pull the trigger. This show was once my favorite show, but it's now extremely painful to watch. If you want good quality ""South Park"" only watch seasons 1-4.",NA,"6 October 2002"
"170","I gave up on this show shortly into it's second season, when it began to get very repetitive and boring - the jokes were relying on the same gags and swear words, and each plot was about the town being attacked by some supernatural force.But after catching the movie & the bulk of the show's 5th season this year, I must say it seems to have bounched back.  It's actually become a very clever satire - this season episodes dealt with Sex Education in Public Schools, the war on terrorism, gays in the boy scouts, the media scandals of Gary Condit, the Ramsy's and O.J. Simpson - all better than anything else on television.  Yes, it's also raunchier than ever, but it's well-timed and usually goes for much more than mere shock value.Seeing the Simpsons has lost much of it's satarical edge over the years and become little more than 30-minutes of badly-timed animated slapstick, the reinvigorated South Park is quite a blessing for those of us who hunger for society and pop culture to be brutally and tastelessly ripped apart.",NA,"16 December 2001"
"171","South Park returns to cap off a second decade of comedy.The twentieth season continued to use the reason trend of serializing the episodes so that the season exists as a whole building towards a silly climax. This season tackled the onslaught of trolls across the internet especially on social media websites with Gerald Broflovski being a secret troll SkankHunt. The season tried to capture the election but as they were stunned by the Trump win as most of the media were, they whiffed on the day after episode and had to catch up in the next few with Mr. Garrison standing in for the president. They did have the coiffed hair of our current President-elect and showed how the troll army worked in his favor.They had turned away from their attack of PC culture in the previous season but still registered some of the cultural shifts like white men believing they have a reason to be upset at women and bashing them for their lack of opportunity in comedy. All of this didn't amount to much as this felt like a weaker season of South Park, not sure of what they wanted to say and balancing several complicated issues.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com","9","8 December 2016"
"172","About 4 months before Beavis and Butt-Head (1993) came to an end, South Park began airing in 1997. For many Beavis and Butt-Head fans at the time South Park was welcome, not as a replacement but at least there was another adult comedy TV show to keep us entertained. Instead of teens (like in Beavis and Butt-Head) dealing with society we have got preteens dealing with society instead. The animation style of South Park was refreshing and seeing preteens swear was funny at the time. As an adult comedy TV show South Park did very well for about a decade or so, but in its second decade, South Park is obviously struggling to remain as good, witty and innovative as it once was. Now, with other adult comedic TV shows around (which are usually very bad), and with the return of Beavis and Butt-Head (2011), South Park feels like it has issues to remain significant. The same applies to Futurama (1999) since it has returned in 2008. While the Simpsons (1989) paved the way for adult oriented comedic TV shows, Beavis and Butt-Head perfected it and South Park continued to perfect the genre; but since then TV shows like Family Guy (1999) and Drawn Together (2004-2008) have corrupted the genre with sexual promiscuity, sexual perversity, drug abuse, bashing of Christianity, etc, which has become standard in the movie, TV and music industry. In turn, South Park became no longer controversial and shocking, but mainstream and finally, just ""toilet"" humor. Why? Because South Park has failed to do anything against the demoralization of the entertainment industry what South Park did against everything else. In fact, South Park jumped quite often on the bandwagon of the entertainment industry. It's like with Cartoon Wars (episode 2 and 3 of season 10), South Park's spoof of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. In the two episodes it is announced that a Family Guy episode will air with the Muslim prophet Muhammad uncensored, leaving the whole of the United States fearing for their lives. If it was any other TV show, you would know that they would bash freedom of speech and Christianity in support for censorship and Islam; but in case of South Park, you automatically would expect the opposite. I'm not saying that that it or is not the case with Cartoon Wars (to avoid giving away any spoilers), but the final episode of Cartoon Wars shows exactly the problem that South Park is unable to overcome, no matter how hard South Park tries. South Park is able to mock Walt Mart (""Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes"" (season 8, episode 9)), prostitutes (""Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset"" (season 8, episode 12)), racism (""Ginger Kids"" (season 9, episode 11)), etc, but not homophilia (aka ""homosexuality"") (""Follow That Egg!"" (season 9, episode 10)), for example. Neither does South Park dare to mock established psychology/sexology (""Sexual Healing"" (season 14, episode1)).When it comes to what is acceptable to make fun of, in the last decade it has become almost a constitutional requirement in the entertainment industry to trash heterosexuality, traditional marriages, Christianity, etc. At the same time it has become strictly forbidden to make fun of sexual promiscuity, sexual perversity, Islam, etc. Anything gay, for example, is automatically portrayed (by most TV shows and movies) as the best thing ever (not even Beavis and Butt-Head has ever dared to go as far as stating anything against gays). It's so amazingly annoying how one-sided the entertainment industry has become. South Park is also guilty of that. South Park started off well, but over the years South Park has become like an unpopular kid at school who became popular by standing up to a few bullies at school, but when he needed to stand up against the biggest bullies at school, he ran away. That's South Park. Kyle, one of the show's protagonists, has said in an episode: ""pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction. You'll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely."" Ironically, that's where South Park is headed.When South Park does things right, the episodes turn out to be awesome (such as with ""The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers"" (season 6, episode 13) or ""Make Love, Not Warcraft"" (season 10, episode 8)). That's when South Park is at its best, exposing the idiocy of society.Out of the four main characters, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick, only Eric Cartman stands out as a worthy character. Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski are totally unnecessary, very alike and (in particular Kyle Broflovski) boring. Kenny McCormick is even more unnecessary as he doesn't really talk and serves mainly as a fourth character in the group, who just ""stands there"". There are many other dull characters in the show (especially the preteens), such as Token Black, Tweek Tweak, etc. Most characters can easily be thrown away. Of all the kids in the show, Eric Cartman and Butters Stotch are the most interesting ones. The episodes that center around them (such as ""AWESOM-O"" (season 8, episode 5)) are either the best episodes or one of the best episodes of the show.Overall, South Park has some really good episodes that are worth checking out and some episodes that are mainstream nonsense (for which you can tune into Family Guy or Drawn Together instead as they do a better job at supporting gay marriages, sexual promiscuity, trashing Christianity, etc). By now the show is going downhill and screaming to be canceled. As a whole South Park has had its opportunities and missed the most important ones to remain relevant (and only stands out as an adult comedic TV show because there aren't really any other good ones, except for Beavis and Butt-Head). If South Park won't be canceled soon, chances are that the show will become just as bad as Family Guy.","5","29 January 2012"
"173","Now it's over.A crass, obnoxious surprise hit for Comedy Central, South Park's first several seasons were painfully funny. The writing was consistently intelligent, even WITH all the stupid humor. The show was meteoric satire: it hit EVERYTHING, including itself, which made it very hard to attack.They've lost the light in the last two seasons, though. The funniest aspect of the show was the characters. These were real, believable kids reacting to all these twisted adventures. Now, though, the duo responsible for the show have fallen into the trap of turning child characters into miniature adults. They're particularly guilty of doing this with Stan, and to a lesser extent, Kyle. Cartman and Kenny (Butters, sometimes) remain the two most childlike characters, so their motivations and actions are still funny. But they can't make up for the humor drain caused by the other boys talking like educated adults, instead of ignorant children.Time to go, South Park. We'll always have our memories. Unless somebody hits us with a framing hammer.",NA,"16 December 2003"

"175","South Park in a sense a show that can entertain any adult or teen with its great characters and brilliant writing make this a fantastic show. The reason South Park works is that it makes fun of everything like not one side is safe like other comedy shows that's brilliance of South Park in a sense. If I had to say something bad is that later seasons especially season 20 are not focusing on what made the show great and basically I hope they learn their lesson and do the show like it was during its golden age. Overall however South Park is still a favorite of mine due to pulling no punches to offend and while the seasons are not great it's still one of the best tv shows of all time.

These are very nasty kids too, who talk about as bad as I do when I'm with my friends (I just graduated from High School).

There's the parents, and there's their lunchroom chief who gets in bed with girls, and there's the Hunters, there's Mr Hankey, the Christmas poop who gives gifts to Jews on Christmas day and got Kyle locked in an asylum on Christmas, and Mr. Garrison, the kid's teacher complete with stupid puppet in hand.

"178","Nobody handles satire like Matt Stone and Trey Parker. I mean these guys are the masters. Shows like The Simpsons and Family Guy are preschoolers playing checkers, and South Park is Chess played by mathematicians. I mean these guys are great at executing crude/political/tasteless humor at a mature level. Which is what is awesome about South Park, the show is actually very mature, despite what many think. The entire episode is the joke, whereas many adult cartoons, just have a basic story, then sprinkle in crude jokes here and there. South Park's jokes have content, and meaning. There is not one joke that is irrelevant. These guys are also not afraid to make fun of anyone. Liberals, conservatives, nonseculars, atheists, agnostics (what is Dr. Pepper btw?), etc. No one is off-limits, and many of my own personal beliefs have been made fun of, and I laugh my ass off every time. South Park does not discriminate. The writers are not afraid to tackle risky subjects or change the format, and the jokes have a purpose. Something many shows cannot say. As long as their are people on this planet, South Park will continue to have subject matter to poke fun at, and I do not know if it will ever get old.","10","6 July 2017"

Those 4 friends are Kenny McCormack, Kyle Broflovski, Stan Marsh, and Eric Cartman (even know Eric isn't really friends with the 3 others.) These 4 live in South Park, Colorado, a small mountain town where big things happen (well at least they're big to the four main characters.) The show perfectly parodies celebrities. If you look at how they parody celebrities, it's actually quite ingenious. For how much rave I'm giving this, it's not for everyone. It's in very bad taste, and will be utterly offensive to some. The show involves everything that could possibly be offensive. That said, that's what I like about the show. It's not afraid to be offensive on cable television. Just like Fritz The Cat was the first X-Rated film, this is the first M-Rated show. That makes me scream: How Daring! If you're not easily offended, then definitely check out this show. It is so offensive and daring to the point where it will change your life from how good it is.","10","29 June 2009"

Now it seem like they joined the the ignorant site.Now it just sad. Just like the saying ""a comedian is only as good as his last show"", South Park shows that they are not funny anymore and i feel bad for them for not stopping, after they have became humourless.Now they are just some sad losers, who because of they're ignorens are going down with the ship.","2","23 April 2020"

References of current events that people laugh at to let the other idiots in the room know that they understood what was intended to be a joke, but what never was simply because it is not funny. Genius? Not at all. Painfully annoying? To the fullest extent. This is what stupid people watch when they want to express their knowledge of current events and world events by laughing in a social context at referencial jokes where not one drop of humor is to be found. It's like the guy at the table who is in no way amusing but when he says something that was intended to be funny people laugh. Not because it was funny, but because it was intended to be funny and they're afraid of being perceived as stupid for not laughing so they laugh. Then the idiot keeps telling more jokes.

"189","In my opinion, South Park isn't as good as everybody says it is. It's just a bad follow-up to other better shows like The Simpsons, Beavis and Butt-Head and Ren and Stimpy. I'm not saying the show is all bad. In it's defense the earliest episodes had to be the funniest like Cartman Gets An Anal Probe and An Elephant Makes Love To A Pig and I like Cartman's voice.The creators of South Park Matt Stone and Trey Parker are a lot funnier than their creation. I loved their movies BASEketball and Orgazmo but the South Park movie really sucked. I think these two should get their own show.

"190","The newest season of South Park is absolutely awful. Not only was it garbage but there was so much potential for it, but they wasted it all on the US election and memberberries (Which are more annoying than Jar Jar Binks). Those could've easily been their own episode but Matt and Trey just decided to reuse the same jokes over and over again. There were so many things they could've destroyed this year but they didn't. Where was the Harambe episode? Where was the Music.ly episode? Where was the Pokemon Go episode? The jokes weren't even funny thisseason, I probably only actually laughed maybe 3 times, which is horrible considering I used to laugh every second of every episode not too long ago. I give the season 20 5/10 stars and everything else 10/10s, expect for seasons 18 and 19 which get 8.5/10 stars.","7","17 January 2017"
"191","There is a tendency on South Park in which various jokes (which are pretty funny at first) are recycled.  There's a joke in which one of the characters proclaims that he isn't ""fat"" but instead has big bones, a joke in which one of the characters breaks out into song, a character who has the tendency to saying the word ""okay"", etc.  One of the recycled jokes on South Park that can go one this list is one of the qualities on this show, a running gag in which one of the characters (I won't emulate on this because I don't want to spoil the joke) gets killed in virtually every episode.  The problem with this running gag in particular, is that after a while, you come to expect it coming towards the end of an episode (it's going to happen sooner or later) and because of it, the gag grows increasingly tiresome.  Not to mention that the show seemingly out of desperation will resort to the usage of persistent profanity (another one of the qualities on South Park) as a way to get a laugh.  Perhaps the incredibly off-the-wall storytelling (which underlines the persistent profanity, second-rate animation, and running gags) on South Park is the only quality that can remain appealing in the long run as there are various subjects that the show will take on.  In spite of the fact that the show can come up with outandish stories on a frequent basis, it still seems like that the South Park still has little to fall back on.",NA,"1 November 1999"
"192","Is it misunderstood? To me it's like they want to limit their audience? They create a hilarious concept such as when you get older every new song on the radio sounds like crap. So they actually play flatulence with this crazy drumbeat and it makes ten year olds to sixty year olds laugh their butts off. But then what? Instead of filling out that episode with some other ideas, they put in more gross-out comedy with feces coming out of people's mouths. I love the show despite the toilet humour not because of it. But a little less would have won more fans for the show, methinks.","9","31 December 2018"
"193","When this show came out when I was 10-years-old and some time after, it was a novelty and became hit just because it surprised the world depicting children using profane, and occasionally obscene dialogue. And it wasn't as apparent that the show is a satire and it focuses on skewering every facet of every society on earth. It's not like other shows on Comedy Central that focus on and virtually live for raunchy humor. The lewd words are not as frequent as Beavis and Butthead its former ""competition"". And I think it has some of the cutest most charming characters ever put on television. Kyle who has diabetes, a medical condition similair to mine, as implied on Season Four Episode Cherokee Hair Tampons (one characted I can actually relate to) who is every bit involved in the action and mayhem. The show's definitely not for ""children"" but it's a satire that is crude "" occasionally"". I think Butters is the greatest most charming character on the show (who couldn't like him?) he even plays Hello Kitty Island Adventure which makes him even cooler, though he's a shunned nerd at school. I mostly each it for entertainment as opposed to laughs, but Satan I think is the funniest character how he is portrayed as a touchy feely guy who makes everyone in hell happy and has relationships and a house and a soap opera themed episode.",NA,"12 July 2007"

But we must seriously ask ourselves, how did this show ever get on air? It's not funny, it's not even amusing where you smile without laughing, or laugh on the inside...it's just lame. Ear piercing voices that just speak objectionable nonsense, just like the schoolyard kids. It's the worst of the schoolyard making its way onto TV. And now many kids are learning from it as we speak.Like heck my family watched Barney Miller and 3's Company when they were growing up...they watched REAL shows. Can't these people make a real show? What about Dragon Ball Z and stuff? I guess there's no class anymore.0/10","1","9 August 2016"
"206","About this show this has a lot of Hilarius parts of the episodes. Britney Wuatch is the funniest part in the show when she had a zit on her face and when she was taking a pee. There's another Hilarius part where Terrence or Phillips said ""Im Not Your Guy Fran"" and ""Im Not Your Fran Buddy"". Another funny part is when Cartman, Eric, and the others in line waiting and somebody tells them about who's in line star wars kid, the person with a song called mi a he mi a ha, sneezing panda, and the prairie dog. This show is the best to watch I hope this show makes it funny for you to watch it is more better than any Comedy Central show on TV for late nights.","10","5 April 2008"
"207","South Park is my favorite TV comedy ever! It is absolutely genius and hilarious. Watching how much the characters in this ""stupid humor"" comedy develop is pure entertainment. South Park looks at modern topics and issues and portrays them in comedic and ridiculous ways. It is set in Colorado as four friends go to school, meet girls, battle dirty politics, and really do anything else imaginable! The list goes on and on. This is a show that pushed the boundaries of what should be allowed to be shown on TV. A lot is dirty and extremely offensive, but take it as a satire. The show isn't for everyone, but if you take it as a satire South Park is highly entertaining.I've been watching the show for years and will continue doing so as long as it is on air. The characters never seen to get old as the story actually keeps evolving to give characters new life! South Park will focus on different characters during different seasons. This helps the keep material fresh and the audience can take breaks from certain characters.Do yourself a favor and give South Park a chance. I promise you will get a laugh out of it! 9/10","10","15 February 2016"

"209","An uproariously funny social satire!Trey Parker and Matt Stone (the creators) also provide most of the voices for this sick little comedy which quickly became cable's highest rating show, and a worldwide phenomenon.The show is about 4 3rd graders: Stanley ""Stan"" Marsh (who throws up whenever near Wendy), Kyle Broslofski (a 'lonely' Jew), Eric ""Cartman"" Cartman (the show's main draw and resident fatty) and Kenny McCormick (the poor kid, who dies each episode).Like 'The Simpsons', South Park is home to some pretty wild and wonderful characters. From the iliterate town police officer and self-obsessed mayor to the hormonally-driven school chef and the homosexual third-grade teacher there's always someone there to make you laugh.Many people thought that the 4th grade series would flop. But it's just as funny - if not more. The four boys hang out with Tweek, Butters and Timmy more, and the new fourth-grade teacher Ms. Cocksindicks is sooooooooo funny. The addition of new characters has not deterred this immensely popular cult comedy.Unfortunately, the suicide of the only female voice actor (Mary Kay Bergmen) held up production. But with the show back on track, the future looks even brighter for the four foul-mouthed little s***s that wreak havoc through the towns of South Park.How Parker and Stone continue to produce such an amazing show for so many years is beyond me, but with the story lines they come up with, and the league of hugely-funny South Park residents, I know that this show will be around for a while longer yet.",NA,"21 January 2002"

Open your eyes, people! This show is anti-semitic, racist, sexist and just overall terrible!Where was the FCC during the 4th season? on a damn coffee break?If there's one thing I've learned, it's that they should have canceled this piece of crap a long time ago.

"212","Tbh i dont even care about the satire or the offensive shock humor anymore... the stories, characters, music, world-building, and writing are all just way too good that even the most insensitive stuff doesn't even shock me anymore cause the characters are all incredibly well crafted that i cant help but love them all.The show never fell off, it's been amazing since the first shorts from the early 90s, there are some weak episodes here and there (mrs. Garrison episodes, later half of season 20, #HappyHolograms...) but even then there are a lot of redeeming qualities to those episodes.Honestly, i kind of prefer the newer episodes to the old ones, some people consider seasons 3-9 the ""golden era"" of south park, but to me, that's the current episodes, i love that they're focusing on characters other than the 4 main boys because the world of south park is such a bright and sunny place with a lot of really colorful and awesome characters and they all deserve to have a bit more focus on them.",NA,"16 May 2021"
"213","I agree with Surlent, KefkaGod, and Surlent-2 (even though they are the same person): This Show Sucks. Trey and Matt, nothing you can think of is original. (i.e. An episode was called ""City on the Edge of Forever."" Why didn't the Star Trek producers sue them?) I watched this show for a while. Then I realized how obvious it was that this is for people who think they are gods, or think that a person's death can be funny.Pikachu-16 (my brother) likes this. The thing is, he thinks anything can be turned into a joke. Nope. To anyone who disagrees with me: WHY DO YOU THINK DYING, GETTING RESURRECTED, AND GETTING KILLED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS FUNNY?Trey and Matt, this one has to die soon. When it does, go out and be normal so others will realize the truth: It is just not real, it is just not high quality. I wouldn't be surprised if you make fun of High Quality films like Citizen Kane, The Godfather, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I would be surprised if it still lived older than MST3K (see my reviews).",NA,"25 May 2001"

"215","I started recording the episodes of south park because i heard all the praise it was getting, and i think i made a great decision. I am always on the lookout for a show that can make me laugh, and south park accomplishes this in almost every episode. I don't have a favorite episode or character because i really don't have one. The reason i say this is because i like all the episodes and characters. The show makes you like certain characters that in real life aren't meant to be likable. Some of the episodes however aren't has funny, but they are still entertaining to watch. By the way if you have children then please don't show this to your kids, unless you want them to learn how to swear. So overall i really enjoy south park, it is fun and funny and always knows how to entertain its audience. It is my 2nd favorite show of all time!","10","19 August 2016"
"216","""South Park"" is considered to just be a bunch of unfunny potty humor by many people. The truth is, there is more going on than just what people thinks is going on. Trey Parker and Matt Stone show off their comedy talent with this outrageous comedy that manages to ride the line without going too far. Unlike shows like ""Family Guy"", the creators know exactly what to do with the material and their jokes go beyond what people actually think. They manage to joke about serious things and events without actually making fun of them and instead, have a clever way of getting their message across. An episode this is shown in is ""Butt Out"" where the boys smoke cigarettes and get Rob Reiner to show up. Instead of portraying the cigarette company as the bad guys like most shows would, they show them being good guys with Reiner and his anti-smoking people being the bad guys who are willing to do anything to get cigarettes band.""South Park"" is a one in a million show that is able to get away with anything they do because they know how to use the material correctly and not make fun of the wrong person in the scenario, unlike ""Family Guy"". This is the perfect show to watch if you like outrageous comedy but if you also want it to be sophisticated.","8","4 August 2013"
"217","Rated TV-MA for Language,Violence and Sexual Content.South Park is my all time favorite TV show.How can anyone not like this show.The animation isn't the best but the jokes are hilarious,its a very good satire show.The show has been on since 1997.The show changed greatly after a while.When South Park first aired the show was filled with toilet humor and profanity.It was still funny though.Later on however the show changed and became a hilarious political satire with a take on todays politics and things like that.Just compare say the episode ""Douche and Turd"" or ""Cartoon Wars 1 and 2"" to earlier episodes like ""Cartman Gets An Anal Probe"" and you will see the difference.The show has four main characters.Stan,Kyle,Kenny and Cartman.However Kenny dies at the end of Season 5 so for the first half of season 6 Butters is Kenny's replacement and the second half it is Tweek.Kenny returns after.My favorite character would have to be Cartman.He is hilarious and he makes most of the jokes.Trey Parker and Matt Stone are comic geniuses.South Park is a must see show! Many people say its bad for kids but I think it is suitable for anyone over the age of 9.South Park started out with two short films entitled The Spirit Of Christmas.One came out in 1992 and the other came out in 1995.You can find both on the internet.Anyway great TV show.My favorite.Runtime:30min 10/10","10","12 August 2006"

But i didn't really understand the adult jokes and the true meaning of this show. I saw all episodes, and I talked a lot of about the sow to my friends. I actually grew up on south park.Now I'm 15 and I understand what this show really want to say. Now I don't watch it because of the curse language, I watch it because of the satiric humor.I recommend all seasons to all ages.","10","18 November 2017"

"220","Of late,I've been watching a lot less of this show.I'm not really sure why,because I've never been entirely turned off by it the most recent times I've watched it. Maybe I've grown a little fatigued with the skewering of characters I had gotten used to,or perhaps it feels like the show has been trying to stoke more controversy than it needs to(and it really always has,to be honest). Still,I'd recommend this show to anybody not familiar with it,something I'd find hard to believe that there are still people who fit that description but I'm sure they're out there.Ten plus seasons of the crudely(or not-so-crudely)animated series about the residents of a small mountain town in Colorado,the brain-child of co-creators Trey PArker and MAtt Stone,has exploded into a multi-layered show that deals with subjects ranging from the sublime(school bullies,rivalries,romance,friendships)to the ridiculous(often this ends up being stuff dealing with celebrities,usually rather unflatteringly so),and sometimes the profound. Notorious for gross,raw and sometime outright rude and blasphemous,this show has shown some softer sides as well. A credit to the writing and a sharp,gambler's mentality in terms of episode plot topics(everything from the RAin Forests to Scientology)make this show always worth a look,if not abject loyalty. Even though the proverbial gild has come off the Lily(So to speak)for this show,I still find it one of the more clever half-hours of comedy on television.",NA,"1 February 2008"

"222","South Park may be the most famous cartoon on TV since The Simpsons. South Park is the on-going story of four youths from Colorado who have every day adventures along with the annual death of their silent friend Kenny in every episode.The show is quite crude. Strong language is used often and other very 'suggestive' themes come out in each episode. But the show isn't here to just show four of the oddest children, the show takes an in-depth look at violence and politics, the media and many more parts of society. Many people may think that this show is cruel and awful to anyone in the world. The show does go occasionally to far but is still funny as hell.The four kids act in kind of the way I did as a kid. I'm not saying I watched the same friend die everyday but in the way they talk and hang out together is simply perfect. The comedy and gags are dead on an always will at least force a smile from its viewer.Trey Parker and Matt Stone have made a genius show that is funny in its own, odd way. Try not to take it too seriously. It's entertainment nothing more. it's not meant to offend but entertain.South Park.

"224","When I was younger I never had any intentions to see this particular program. When my younger siblings would watch it I would shut it off and yell at them. I thought it was a stupid and immature show, boy was I wrong. To date I've seen probably around sixty of the episodes (I could be off), I own the movie and season 5. I only started watching the show a couple of months ago. You see I never watched it before, but late night at 1:30 in the morning on the FOX station where I live, this show is played and when you just get home from work and you want to watch something more that infomercials of TV, this was perfect. My sister and I watched it together and soon fell in love with it. The jokes are up to date and hilarious. The characters are the funniest and the show is all around an outstanding achievement. I have now come to realize that Matt Stone and Trey Parker are geniuses and I have now seem much of there work because of the brilliant show. It amazes me why I like this show because my movie and television favorites range immensely. My favorites shows are ""Queer as Folk"" (USA only), ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"", and of course my newly beloved ""South Park"". My favorite movies are the entire ""Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy, ""Brokeback Mountain"", and ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"".

"226","Wow! So much hate for the show? Ha-ha. I get that it is not for everyone, but don't knock it just because you don't understand or agree with it. Rather just don't watch it and leave those of us who do alone. Sure the profanity can be offensive, but then let's face it, you are just being a prude! Almost every episode has an underlying message of some sort with a deeper meaning. Not only that, but it shows you the funny side of a seriously messed up world with a sick, but amusing twist. Learn to laugh a little, you might enjoy it. Who care's if they rip on Ginger's or Jew's a lot? They rip on everyone. Don't think that they are just targeting you. You are not that special! They rip on the fatties, the whites, the blacks, the tall, the short, the celebrities....everyone. Gosh if people are going to take it so seriously then you deserve to be ripped on. If you honestly claim that people rip on you more because of South Park, then you are deluded. South Park may have given them better lines to use, but they were going to do it with or without the help of the show, so get over it!That being said, my thoughts on this show is that it is nothing short of pure brilliance. The humour is witty and snide. It has a sense of cuteness to it too (like when Cartman or Butters sing *heart melts*). I love it, and I try and surround myself mostly with others who love it too. It taught me about the Mormons and Scientology. It can be rather educational :-D. I mean how else would I have learned that the lid on the top of the toilet was for my chocolate milk and comic books, and that all this time I was sitting on it the wrong way round? *giggle*.When asked the question about who I want to meet dead or alive. My top answer is always Matt Stone and Trey Parker. What I wouldn't give to spend a day hanging out with those two!!!Screw you guys...I'm going home...","10","6 August 2012"
"227","South Park was a huge hit not too long ago for reasons I cannot explain. Similar to the Simpsons, South Park tries to show us the direction we're heading to in life, and adds in a lot of ""gross out"" humor, not to mention tons more swearing.  All in all, it's just not that entertaining.  Kenny dying over and over again is pretty stupid, and the jokes on religion are better done on the Simpsons (even though I am strong in the faith of Christianity.) If you want jokes on society today, watch the Simpsons.  If you want gross out humor, watch Cow and Chicken.  Both provide better entertainment, as well as better animation.",NA,"18 June 2000"

They really made this show hilarious with the George Zimmerman episode and how if he killed a white kid he would of received the death penalty.

"238","The reason that I don't watch TV very often is because it's all the same. Every crime/drama is the same, and with very few exceptions (Scrubs), sitcoms and animated shows are all the same. South Park is not like other shows. It's the biggest exception of them all. It's plain and simply the funniest, most flat-out brilliant and original show on TV right now. South Park is an animated satire that revolves around four elementary school boys, who live in the small Colorado town, South Park, where seemingly everything that's wrong with the world is abundant, and if it isn't, it usually will be eventually. The problems are usually brought on either by celebrities, aliens, ignorant parents, and/or stupid people who conform to the latest fad, or take current events/social issues way too seriously. The boys are usually the only ones left to stop these incidents. There is Stan, the good-natured every-kid, with a confused view of the world brought on by the stupidity of everyone around him. There is the friendly, but endlessly nervous, Kyle, who's Jewish upbringing has resulted in constant ridicule, and questionable self-esteem. He remains a good-natured, and very intelligent kid. There is Kenny, who is really just a walking sight gag, who rarely talks, and is almost always killed off without adding much to the plot of the episode. Then there is Cartman (oh god, Cartman), who is a fat, racist, sexist, intolerant, evil, manipulative, sadistic, mean-spirited sociopath, who has no conscience, and hasn't a care in the world for anyone other than his cruel self.The kids on the show are much smarter than the adults, who know nothing but stereotypes, and doing what's expected of them to the point of disaster (Kyle's mom is a perfect example of this). Whenever a major social issue like politics, or religion is brought up, their ignorance towards the matter generally results in chaotic, often supernatural incidents. A fine example of the South Park adults is Randy Marsh, Stan's dad, who falls victim to every major issue, and represents everything wrong with America. There is also a police detective who seems to do his job based on bad cop movie clichés, and hasn't the slightest sense of logic.South Park is the greatest show on television. It has the balls to do whatever the hell it wants, and always gets away with it; if someone is offended, or has anything bad to say about it publicly, chances are, that person is going to get satirized in the next episode. Nothing is sacred in South Park. It is also as smart as TV gets, and makes points about controversial subjects that only the most ignorant person wouldn't possibly stop to think about. The sad thing is, there are many of those people, who bash South Park for being nothing more than an excuse to show little kids swearing like sailors, and nonstop poop jokes. People with that view of the show will most likely never be cured. Much of the dirty humor on the show is simply metaphorical for the subject they are skewering. The main character's favorite show is a program called Terrance and Phillip, where two guys do literally nothing but swear and fart. The show is meant to make fun of how bashers of South Park look at it, and always will look at it.The pop culture jabs are by far the best. Politics are one thing, but sometimes, there is nothing funnier than celebrities being ruthlessly mocked and stereotyped, and South Park does it better than anyone. Celebrities always show up in South Park to cause havoc, or spread their political views, often with an evil and/or supernatural twist that represents the dumbest thing about them. Rob Reiner is portrayed as a hypocritical, fascist slob, who is always sweating, gasping, and eating some sort of fatty food. Al Gore is portrayed as a desperately lonely, and annoying loser who tries to get attention by spreading rumors of the biggest threat to our planet- ManBearPig, in an episode that perfectly sums up the satirical genius of the show. Another episode makes fun of underdog sports movies, in which the boys compete to lose the championship baseball game, but despite their best efforts, end up on a winning streak. Family Guy and The Simpsons may do it well, but South Park does movie parodies better than anyone. Speaking of Simpsons and Family Guy, South Park knows it's a better show than them, and in the two-part Cartoon Wars episode, makes the reasons totally clear. Family Guy's random, non-sensical comedy style is skewered so hard, it nearly made me question why I found it funny in the first place. And Bart Simpson shows up for a cameo, and his exchange with Cartman sums up the differences between the two shows perfectly.South Park is a filthy show and tackles every controversial subject imaginable. Therefore it is not for everyone. But open-minded viewers will understand the groundbreaking genius of the show, and see it for the perfect satire that it is. South Park brings you into a twisted, gross, and absurdly hilarious new universe with every episode, and doesn't let you go for the next 22 minutes. Political correctness be damned, South Park rules.South Park is rated TV-MA for nonstop crude/dark humor, graphic language, sexual content, violence, gore, and pretty much everything that could possibly be considered offensive.Sex- 8/10 Violence- 10/10 Swearing (by TV's standards)- 10/10 Drugs- 7/10","10","9 June 2007"

"241","I flat out love this show so much. The jokes are 95% of the time hilarious, 4.9% funny, and 0.1% flat. Which means that the show probably only has one flat joke per season. The animation is very simple, but that adds charm to it. It's like ""Charlie Brown"" only very vulgar. Many people decide to skip the show without ever seeing based on how they think it's to juvenile. Yes the show is very violent, and very dirty, but the jokes in the show can still be hilarious without much vulgarity. My mother always laughs at South Park for its real jokes that are very funny. The first seasons of South Park were vulgar, but didn't have a lot of brain to back it up. It was charming, but not very bright. Then it started to get much smarter with its jokes. The dialogue got sharper, and the jokes got smarter. I really don't think that this show should be limited to one group of people. I believe that it can appreciated by many different age groups for its smart humor. Sure my grandmother wouldn't like the vulgar stuff, but behind that is genius that anyone can appreciate. The characters in the show are all likable, and hilarious. The four main characters are Kyle, Stan, Kenny, and Cartman. Kyle is the the smartest, and finds the morals to the issue that is happening in the show. Stan is the leader of the group. Most episodes are mainly about him. He is the one who feels like he is in the center of the mess he and his friends gets into in an episode. Kenny is the unfortunate one. He always can be found dieing in the show. He never shows his face, and never speaks a clear word due to his coat covering up most of his face. Then there is Cartman. Like Homer to ""The Simpsons"" Cartman is the most beloved character on the show. He is a racist, Jew-hating, jerk. He always insults people, and does horrible things. Despite this Kyle, Stan, and Kenny still are friends with him, but often insult him for being such a jerk. That is the same with his fans. He is a very unlikeable jerk that you just love to watch. He acts so awful, and does such horrible things, but you love him. It's not easy to explain why he is so likable despite being unlikeable. Cartman is an icon in animation, and is is definitely one of my favorite characters on the show. Then there is many likable minor characters. There is Stan's parents, Kyle's parents, Cartman's mom, Mr. Slave, Chef, Bebe, Token, Towelie, Ike, Mr. Garrison, and many more. They are all very likable, but the best by far is Butters. He is one of the most innocent characters in TV history. He is so innocent, but is surrounded by the chaos of everyday life in South Park. That makes him my favorite character in the show. Cartman is a close second, but Butters innocence is just so likable. He doesn't ever want to anger anyone, and doesn't usually understand when he is being tricked. His innocence mixed with the cruel world Butters lives in equals pure genius. Overall South Park is one of the best shows on TV. If you haven't seen it watch it now.","10","12 August 2010"

"244","Sadly, matt and trey have no original story ideas anymore like they did in earlier seasons. They rely 100% on pop culture references, politics, media, and current events to keep their show going. It shows they aren't savvy writers like most other Hollywood writers are. If they didn't have that huge crutch to lean on, this show would've crumbled a long LOOOOOOOOONG time ago. I do commend the guy's dumb luck to keep a show going for over 20 years based solely on pop culture references. But it's way more entertaining to watch a show with fresh, original ideas and stories, than a show that just regurgitates what's going on in the media every episode. That formula has gotten old...like this show. Be original again.","1","24 August 2019"

"247","South Park is a cartoon with a baudy, tasteless attitude.  The animation is terrible, it's full of crudeness, but in the end it makes people laugh.  I mean the antics are very funny and the four main characters are... ""creative"".  Then there's Kenny, the accident prone person, and the Cartman, the big fata**.  It's a show that makes you laugh out loud.  But I recommend it for only adults, not children.",NA,"3 June 1999"
"248","Watching recently made episodes of ""South Park"" makes me somewhat depressed because I see how far the show has fallen in terms of quality.I have watched ""South Park"" since I was about 9 years old. I remember on Wednesday nights, my Mother and I would stay up together for new episodes. I could not get enough of it! I remember gasping for air, falling off my couch when I watched the pilot episode ""Cartman Gets an Anal Probe."" It was absolutely hysterical and had a great balance of irreverence with its unique humor. It was pioneering animated comedy shows. I remember going to see the movie, ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut,"" when I was 10 with my parents, and still count the movie as one of the greatest achievements not just in animation or musical history, but in all of film history (by the way Phil Collins did not deserve that Oscar).Today though, I feel I can afford to miss out on recent episodes because I feel I am not missing anything.I don't know what's wrong with the show but it fell overboard sometime during season 8. The whole eighth season was by and large a great success, giving ""South Park"" viewers great episodes like ""Goobacks,"" ""Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset,"" and ""Woodland Critter Christmas."" However, there were one or two episodes that fell way short of my expectations as I did not even chuckle under my breath during the entire episode. The same goes for the ninth season: for the most part very funny, but it was blemished by very sub-par episodes here and there. Things really went downhill with the tenth season. Some of the worst episodes ever made by Matt and Trey were made during this time (""Make Love, Not Warcraft"" definitely not being one of them). There are episodes that really detract from the ""South Park"" legacy from the eighth season to the present season (season 12).In short, ""South Park"" should take the advice of, ""If it isn't broken, don't fix it."" Return the early episodes where it wasn't so much about social commentary and stop being so overtly preachy. I hope that this happens, otherwise many faithful viewers will feel shortchanged by the declining quality of a show that owes it to its fans that it became such a classic and a milestone in animated comedy history.","5","26 March 2008"
"249","South Park has developed into nothing short of a masterpiece.While the first few seasons seemed to rely mostly on shock humor and running gags, the show has turned into a brilliantly written 30 minute political cartoon of sorts, lampooning everything from the president to Rob Schneider.But let's not forget the characters and the show itself. The main four are definite entities, and I wholly believe that as angry as you may get at Cartman, he embodies that little selfish voice in our heads, the one that makes horridly tasteless and offensive jokes that we try to suppress. Cartman merely brought it out into view.Trey and Matt could be some of the smartest people working in television now. Do they use crude humor? Of course, but note HOW it's used. It's not just thrown in there, it always has a purpose. This is one of the few instances where low-brow humor is done well and intelligently. I hate to mention another show, but their other effort That's My Bush was another illustration of their intelligence. Rather than do the obvious and lampoon just Bush, it became a parody of sitcoms, with Bush being the lovably goofy husband. I consider it one of the best comedies ever made along with the short-lived 'Police Squad!' series.Anyway, I'm getting wordy. Simply put, watch the show. It's amazing.",NA,"19 March 2004"
"250","South Park was a great, great show back in the day. Its satirical, clever humour, its hidden gags, its characters. This was a show ingeniously constructed and was far and away the best cartoon back in the day. Seasons 1-6 are the best in my opinion, that was when the stories were at their peak and the jokes were most fresh. Personal favourites were ""Pip"", ""Cartman's Silly Hate Crime"" and ""The New Terrence And Phillip Movie Trailer"".Seasons 7-11 were watchable, but lacked that definitive edge that the first 6 seasons had. After Season 13 finished, I stopped watching; the show had gotten too ridiculous with its plots and the show had lost a lot of its humour.I feel the reason why South Park went on a steady decline when the 6th season finished was not down to lack of ideas or originality in their episodes, it was down to character development. Cartman was affected the worst; in the earlier seasons he was a spoilt, cynical egotistical character that was the center of all jokes in the show. He was a brilliant character and whenever he spoke, you could guarantee that a joke was soon to follow. Slowly though, he transformed from this childlike character to this evil, spiteful character that had a lack of apathy for his friends and the other South Park residents. I also did not like the replacement of Pip Pirrup. Pip was a great character and had a lot more potential that his replacement, Butters. Pip was my favourite character in the show; he was a caring, happy-go-lucky character that also possessed a mean streak when taunted by another character. He was a very solid, dimensional character and his presence drew in an international audience and I'm still confused to this day why he was pretty much ostracized from the show. Butters is a weak, generic character who offers little in terms of plot development or storyline. I also don't like how they pushed Kenny out of the main gang as well, he was a great character in his own right, a fearless, brave character who is willing to fight for his friends; the juxtaposition of the gutless Butters. Giving good characters such as Officer Barbrady, Mr Mackay, Big Gay Al, Chef, Jimbo and Ned less air time and promoting characters such as Randy Marsh (the most overrated character in the show) was also a big mistake.Overall, the first six seasons are easily a 10/10, but the ones after are less funny and have weaker story lines, which is why I give this a 7/10.","7","7 October 2014"
"251","Out of all the adult cartoon shows I've seen, this is by far the best out of them all. I mean, they aren't like Family Guy whom Family Guy looks like an adult cartoon show that wants kids to watch it. In fact, Family Guy is more of a show based on a family with happy lives, not very much dysfunctional. Wow, there's Peter, he's dumb. But in South Park, everyone is dysfunctional and odd, especially the Broflovski family. Their jokes are unique, also, they can turn a clever lame insult used by a normal eight year old into something funny, like the secret sauce of a Big Mac. That's like a metaphor.Stan Marsh, my favorite character. He's pretty mature for his age and mostly the leader of the four boys; Cartman, Kyle, Stan, Kenny. Example, when they wanted to play cops and they became Junior detectives and had to do it seriously. Stan Marsh was in on most of that. Reminds me of Tommy from Rugrats, except he's not stupid.I recommend this television show for anyone who's mature enough to watch it. Although, I do know some kids who watch this show. They're mature to watch and and actually don't light their farts on fire.","10","24 July 2007"
"252","When ""South Park"" hit the scene in '97 I was all in. I watched it faithfully for a few years, then off and on after that. I couldn't stomach it anymore when they did the Christmas poo. It's weird how some things we can watch no problem and then other things really rub us the wrong way. Well, it had already been going that direction for me for a while anyway. It could've been the show, or it could've been me evolving and maturing. Either way, after the Christmas poo episode I was done.","5","17 February 2022"
"253","South Park could well be called the most ingenious television series of the nineties. The thing about the show that most people don't see, is that South Park shouldn't offend anyone, as it only shows us people what we see, but is afraid to say that we do. Yet, it's still shocking, and is most definitely not for everyone. But if you're looking for a good, filthy laugh, Watch South Park!",NA,"25 February 2001"
"254","South Park, the cheapest animation meets social and political satire made to deliver. So, why is it that it's not popular? Wait, who am I kidding? It totally is!!! That's right, this is, next to ""Drawn Together"", CC's most popular a viewed animated television series. Heck, it could even be the most popular show on the channel! It's not for kids, despite it's innocent look. It's also not for the easily offended, easily disgusted, grumps, or Oprah Winfred. Why? Well, firstly, it's VERY adult-related humor. Secondly, it is in no way innocent or for children. Not just because of the mature language and situations, but also because it is not something children should understand. The only flaw in it is that over time, the series has changed. Characters have become smarter and dumber, environments have expanded, and Stan learned not to puke as much. However, it's a rather normal thing for TV shows to do, so I shan't complain. What I will say is ""keep up the great work""!","10","18 August 2013"
"255","When I started to watch South Park I would tape it, preview it, and censor out the parts I thought too hot for my 9 year old daughter.. Then I realized I was doing more harm then letting her watch the whole thing & fielding questions as they arose. I feel it can be a positive experience! The kids are going to watch it anyway (at a friend's house if not at your own)... why not watch it with them and have some control/comment over what they see!I get sick when I am flipping through the channels and see show after show with a guy (usually a cop or a black man) aiming a gun at someone.

"258","There are few shows that can catch you off guard: South Park and Two and a Half Men (who I will write about next) fill the bill PERFECTLY!! I was watching it a few nights ago when one brief aside happened. In shop class, you see two kids only from the back in front of the teacher. One tells the teacher that the other got his face stuck in the belt sander again. In the blink of an eye you see the other kid's face which is totally blank. No eyes, nose , or mouth. Unfortunately, that came on right when I was taking a drink from a mai tai and it came out my nose.I gets deeply into current events by way of social satire and comments on public figures, which, I assume, is why Paris Hilton, Mel Gibson, Stevie Nicks, Bill Clinton, Tom Cruise, Wal-Mart, the Mormons, etc., can't sue their asses off.I don't get Comedy Central so I watch them on reruns or DVD sets (thanks, I've spent $400 on them) and can't wait to see what they do with Obama.....lol!!","10","3 July 2009"
"259","Knowing how highly i put the Chaser on my list, you won't be surprised i think this is one of animations all time classics. The plot involves (for those still unaware) four young boys and Butters. Kyle, Stan, Cartman and Kenny all have distinct styles and ways of reacting to a situation, as do their parents, teachers and odd religious leaders about them. Amid the numerous jokes and satires on Creationism, Christianism, Scientoligy etc the four just want to play their video games and go to their arcade. But always something tries to intervene with them and they battle their way to the object of their dreams, whether it be a Nintendo Wii or uncovering the truth behind some horrid rumour. The jokes don't get old, as with The Simpsons and Family Guy, and the style of animation helps to simplify it just so that it becomes almost painfully obvious what each character is thinking. The hardly animated legs and barely moving arms let the face do all the talking, which, after all, is what it's meant to do.","10","7 June 2007"
"260","One day, my little 6 year old was looking for cartoons on television, while I was looking through the refridgerator for something to eat. I saw these badly animated characters on the TV, and he watched it. I thought he would be OK so I went inside my room to eat and watch TV. When I was done, I came back in the kitchen to throw out the paper plate. Then my son came up to me and said, ""Holy S***, you killed Kenny!."" I asked him, ""What did you say?!"" I wondered where he got that kind of language because I never cuss around him, or watch bad television around him. He pointed to the TV and I saw the same badly animated kids cussing left and write. I ran over and turned it off. I told him he can never watch it agian. I had to put a block on Comedy Central, and I regret that since I watch SNL sometimes. It had to be done, I don't want him using that language around my parents, his school, or anything else. They will think I am a bad parent. I really don't even think this should be on TV. My son doesn't cuss anymore and had to teach him not to. I really regret leaving him in the living room alone with that crap on....",NA,"20 July 2003"
"261","I loved the older South Park episodes where it was less about political commentary and more about the humor, Cartman being a psychopath or Randy being Randy. In the newer ones, however, they have shifted their attention from the personality defects of the leading comedic characters towards storytelling and society issues. I respect their decision but they lost me on the way. I don't watch hours and hours of a show just to get the political commentary of the creators, I want to be entertained.","10","18 July 2019"
"262","This cartoon has been on the air ever since i was in elementary school, my older sister use too watch this a lot back in the day and thats when I got hooked on it. well, South Park is an animated series featuring four boys who live in the Colorado town of South Park, which is beset by frequent bizarre occurrences. The show grew out of short film that Trey Parker and Matt Stone created called The Spirit of Christmas. The show's main characters; Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny are all able to bring a certain charm to the show. Whether it's Kenny's many deaths, Cartman and Kyle's rivalry or even just Stan's normality! The supporting characters are just as good too, and the antics the boys get caught up in are almost always hilarious. However the older episodes are way better than the newer ones, the newer ones suck big time I've noticed they changed the style of the humor and made it more childish rather than have a point to it, like the older ones did. A lot of people i know who use too watch this a lot like me back in the day don't watch it anymore and I don't blame them.","6","13 October 2012"
"263","I'm not going to lie, South Park is one of my favourite shows on TV. It is testament to the talent of Parker and Stone that after all these years their show has remained just as funny, intelligent and completely up-to-date on serious issues. The last two season before this one may have been a little rough with many fans speculating that season 21 would be the last fully serialised season of the show as it appeared that the duo were not able to reach the highs of season 19 again.season 22 has brought new life in to the series however by managing to keep continuity with previous episodes while moving in a more episodic direction. The episodes themselves seem to have a theme about speaking out against something that is wrong and not allowing yourself to become bored and desensitised to the real issues, a topic that South Park is no stranger to covering. However this season also takes time to analyse the show itself form small fan complaints such as the mistreatment of Kenny in later seasons or the lack of episodes centring on the four main charters together to the much larger issues surrounding the shows contribution to the attitude of ignoring real issues.Season 22 still features the trademark gross-out humour of the show, the final two part episode featuring one of the more horrific scenes in the shows run, but manages to balance this with real subsistence that can spark proper debate if you are willing to hear them out. Just like ever other season of South Park a lot of people are going to hate it, this is the show where one character is a talking poo and another is a towel that is always high (both of which play a role in this season). But for fans that feel like the last few seasons have let them down or anyone that hasn't given the show a chance yet and has become bored of the repetitive nature of shows like The Simpsons or Family Guy this is a great place to pick up the show.","8","6 April 2019"
"264","I watch this animated show on sometimes Fridays and Saturdays and I love it! Much better than Simpsons, only seen two episodes of Family Guy and South Park is highest in the rank. Very funny humour and foul language gives this 'adult cartoon' a 10/10. My favourite episode would have to be when they're in Imaginationland and all hell breaks loose. Butters asked the fat hippy guy 'how do I get home'? then the fat hippy guy says 'tap your shoes three times' Butter says 'really' then the fat hippy guy shouted 'no you fuc*ing dipshi* I was fuc*ing joking'. Very funny and my favourite character in South Part would have to be Eric Cartman.","10","27 April 2008"

The orgin story is pretty impressive too. Must watch tv =)","10","14 May 2020"
"266","I love to watch the classic episodes of this show all the time. Because they are funny and cool, and Cartman's voice is my favorite, but in their later years they were still funny but not as funny as before.Pros: The characters are well designed, the jokes based on real celebrities are funny, and the parodies of other shows are also funny. I like how they always make it so that it isn't supposed to be real life based and something really crazy of unreal happens in every episode. I also like how in most of the episodes Kenny dies, that never gets old. Cons: In the later years Cartman's voice changed to a more serious style and that ticked me off. Also in the later years in the original production they would have bleeps in place of a character saying F--- or S---, but now they use words like that without bleeps and it crude and not funny. If you watch episodes on TV you might not notice that but when you watch it online you will. They will have a character saying (bleep)(bleep)(bleep)(bleep)etc on TV but you know if you want to see that online or on I-Tunes you will have to listen to F---,F---,F---,F--- without bleeps and nobody wants to hear that. They also might show a suggestive body part and have it blurred out or a black bar over it you may think ""oh ha-ha thats funny they would not really show that on the show though"", but if you think that you are dead wrong. So if you want to see the show at its funniest watch the censored version or the classic episodes.","8","26 December 2010"
"267","That's how good this show is. Not that much in the early years, but now we would be hard-pressed to find a better aged spirit. It's always relevant and objectively right on target. It's the Mozart of animated shows.Parker is obviously possessed by a higher form of intelligence and/or wisdom. Also make him Dictator for Life, while we're at it - then he'll tell us what to do, and a new, marvelous age will thus begin.Chapeau.","10","13 December 2021"
"268","South Park is easily one of the most wild cartoons out there. South Park does such a good job of taking real world events and topics, than turning them into hilarious episodes. Unlike Family Guy, the South Park creators make fun of everything and everyone under the sun, instead of just making fun of people and topics that they disagree with, which is another huge reason I like the show so much. The characters in South Park are a mixed bag imo, I love Kenny, Stan, Kyle, Chef, Mr Mackey, Jimbo, Butters and a couple of others. Than there are characters in South Park that I really don't like at all, like Mr Garrison, Shelly, PC Principle, and most of the time Eric Cartman. I have heard a lot of people complain about the animation of this cartoon saying, ""it's ugly"" and such, but personally I find the animation unique and actually kind of charming. Obviously this show is not for everyone and I can understand why some people think it's to much, but I enjoy turning the t.v. On and watching this show when I feel like I need a good laugh. I'd watch this any day over God awful Family Guy.","9","18 December 2021"

As they live in the beautiful fictional CO town of South Park. As they watch TV shows and movies that they are not allowed to watch. And curse like sailors.It is seen from their point of view. Way before Seth McFarland and Adult Swim on CN, South Park started it all. As well as put Comedy Central on the map in 1997! Don't watch it as much as I used too but on occasion. Still very enjoyable and funny to watch!","8","14 January 2013"

In closing, all I can say is that SP certainly is good for a perverse laugh once in awhile, but the shows that stand the test of time have heart and value. SP is brutally honest, but seriously lacking.",NA,"22 December 1998"
"276","I do like South Park without a doubt. I'm always entertained by the humour in it, more so I'm into the kind of humour in it just like I love the humour in other shows like Family Guy. I just adore the characters and the way they act or talk rudely, also there has been many episodes that made me laugh out loud.I just have to be honest with one thing. This show tends to go over the top sometimes. I mean, they get away with a lot of things that I doubt any other show would get away with. Family Guy gets unnecessary hate for being offensive, with less major things, but if they were shown on South Park, they wouldn't be considered as offensive. That's what I don't get (for example the fact that Jesus has appeared many times in FG, people thought it was offensive and blasphemous, but if it happened on SP, it wouldn't have been seen as offensive at all.) So what makes this show get away with more than it probably should? Don't get me wrong I don't get offended or butthurt easily like some people but it's just common sense. I do like this show a lot, but what is it that it gets away with a lot more than Family Guy, or in fact any show ever would? I'm focusing mainly on FG because it gets the most criticism. I just want to know this, sensibly. I'm not an easily offended person at all.","8","22 January 2016"
"277","having watched a lot of episodes, i finally decided to make a review. its a clever series. the way the make fun of things is really good. i like how they make many episodes like a Hollywood movie, with all the clichés that follows, and add stupidity. its a really good way too make fun of the things they want to make fun of. also the use of pop cultural references, is actually good. i normally hate pop culture references, because they soon get dated and often are deployed in a bad way. but south-park makes it work for me, probably, because they in a way make them timeless. in other words if you don't get the reference, there is something else you can laugh at in the scene or plot point. the characters are very simple, and they don't really develop and learn. but thats great in this context, because it would ruin the jokes and laughs you get from watching south-park. i will also give the show some credit, for daring to use many controversial topics. its great that somebody dare to stick out, and it is important. if everything controversial got censored, we would miss a lot of good stuff, and we would slowly kill our right of free speech. so all in all i can highly recommend this show, its in the top of the animated comedy shows, and you will have a great time watching it. except if you are easily offended, then you should rather watch something else.","10","9 February 2013"
"278","For many reasons, this show will always hold fond memories for me. I was in junior high school when it premiered, and it didn't take long for the phenomenon to take over. The show's inspired humor and content certainly appealed to our age group. Within weeks, Kenny T-shirts and bad Cartman impressions had become commonplace. I wholeheartedly plunged feet first into the phenomenon and for awhile I was a borderline addict. Of course, the hype eventually died down and by the time I was in high school the likes of Jackass and Family Guy had emerged as the new shows of choice. Somewhere along the way, I lost interest and stopped watching South Park regularly after the fourth season. Earlier this year I caught some newer episodes, and suddenly the warm memories of my early teenage years came flooding back. The show has remained consistently hilarious throughout its impressive run and continues to defy the realms of good taste. No social hot topic or traditional value has escaped the show's demented satiric grasp. Therein lies part of South Park's genius: its uncanny ability to put a humorous spin on anything and anyone without a hint of guilt. I've recently caught up on most of the recent episodes through season 8. Although I'm not too fond of some of the show's newer changes (namely Cartman's new voice and the emergence of Butters as a main character) the crude and irreverent spirit that first got me hooked has remained intact. Plus the animation has improved dramatically, although in some aspects that's not saying much. It was one of the first shows that got me hooked as a rabid fan, and very few have given me as many laughs. For that, South Park will always be remembered as a huge source of entertainment during an important time of my life.","9","13 November 2004"
"279","This show is cool. Even though it may not be good for younger kids under 13. But some kids understand the value of the show. It is a popular show. I give it 10/10. I have the Cartman and Kenny Doll. Those are my favorite Characters. But that sucks that Kenny has to die in each episode. But the movie sucked big time. At least we know what color Kennys hair is-Blonde! yeah that explains it. Also Kenny can talk. He talked in the movie and that was it. Then of course he died.",NA,"23 November 2001"
"280","I notice without surprise that the majority of people who have negative reviews of Southpark are not even American and would not understand the majority of the jokes on the show. The show primarily pokes fun at American pop culture. It pokes fun in a keenly observant way at our fear of anything that challenges our small-minded views, nationalism, commercialism, racism, sexism, religion, political correctness, media abuse, politics, the religious right, and so on. All those ignorant of American culture would understand is the obvious potty humor. An American who says South Park is just potty humor scares me; they failed to see the relevance of the obvious cultural satire found in the majority of its episodes.In my opinion, no subject is too sacred to poke fun at. Any satirical humor is bound to offend people sooner or later.Not only is the humor in South Park clever, the timing in the characters' dialogs is brilliant. It makes light of human nature and grosses you out in the silliest ways possible, making its satire even more offensive to the ideas and people it challenges. Plus, I think this show WOULD still be kind of funny even if it were just about a small white trash podunk town.The show can appeal to mature, educated audiences and childish people who love fart jokes alike. I believe this was the whole point. Some of the humor is offensive to me. Some of the jokes aren't funny (i.e. the molestation episode). But overall this show takes far more risk than any other show I've seen. South Park has accomplished what The Simpsons could only wish for. The Simpsons was really a wimpy, censored, left-wing attempt to poke fun at American ignorance; where it has failed South Park has succeeded beautifully.Watch at least 3 episodes before making up your mind about South Park.",NA,"12 April 2005"
"281","Season 23 is by far the worst season. What ruined it was all the pop culture stuff, usually trey and Matt implement it well by making it into an entire episode with this season it was just all sellout garbage just by saying the name of it, for example in one of the episodes cartman and butters where selling juuls to kid and cartman said to butters ""if my mom find out what we're doing she's going to ground me from fortnite"" and just other forced crap like that. The characters felt dead and I don't like what they did with randy this season, i don't think I'd watch another new season. This season just felt forced and was pretty unfunny.",NA,"11 February 2020"
"282","There was a time when pop culture references would be creatively scattered throughout an episode that contained a completely original story, and that episode may or may not have contained satirical social commentary. Today, anybody who gets their 15 minutes in the pop culture world gets their own episode of South Park. At least Family Guy's pop culture references are mostly confined to 30-second cutaway segments, South Park's last for the entire duration of the show. Episodes even made last year feel incredibly dated because of this tactic, shows from 4-5 years ago feel like looking into a time capsule. Did we really need Snooki the South Park episode? Or Glenn Beck the South Park episode? How about The Royal Wedding or Occupy Wall Street South Park episodes? Episodes like this use current events as a lame crutch and that crutch has crippled the show. It's lazy and devoid of creativity. I'm not just getting older, this show sucks now.It's a shame too because Parker and Stone are extraordinarily talented. I suppose they're getting paid too much for a job that requires little effort at this point so taking this pain in the ass show behind the woodshed and taking it out of its misery is out of the question.","5","26 September 2013"
"283","South Park is always condemned by parents and critics. They contend that it is nothing but toilet humor and it does not teach good morals while going over the line. These people seem to miss the point that people watch TV shows for entertainment and not lessons. If there is one thing South Park does well it is entertain and it does that through controversial yet funny methods.South Park follows 4 eight year old boys living in South Park, a mountain town in Colorado. Usually outrageous events happen that the 4 boys are in the middle of and usually end up solving. The show has no problem making fun of people or current events. But once you get past all of that you see the creativity of the show. The plot is always good and South Park excels at creating very unique situations and characters.However the show usually creates controversy with its humor. There are absolutely no boundaries when it comes to South Park which makes it both popular and unpopular. Sex, drugs, violence, religion, murder, current events, race, and orientation all appear in the show. Nothing is held back in this show and it makes fun of anyone or anything.The beauty of the show lies in that they can take anything and make it funny no matter what it is. South Park is a show that will make you laugh about something that normally you would not or probably should not laugh at. The bottom line is South Park is a comedy show and it is excellent at providing comic relief.","10","25 April 2009"

"285","I do admit, this show has its funny moments. The absolute wildness and insanity of it definitely outweighs the opponents, ""The Simpsons"" and ""Beavis and Butthead"", but it is certainly too over-the-top for me. Parents be-warned. This is not a cartoon!I was reading a review in the paper once about some of the most watched kids shows. I could have guessed the rest, but then I saw this show listed among them and then I realised what was happening. The kids will ask their parents; ""Mum, can I watch South Park?"", and the mum will reply; ""What is it"", and the kid will say; ""Don't worry, mum, it's only a cartoon!"". Only a cartoon. That's the understatement of the millennium. I imagine that all of these cartoon shows are only cartoons so that more possibilities can be put in. If it was live action, there would be limits to what the characters can do.All in all, this is not the most preferred show for me to be watching. Sickening, fast-paced and rude is loved by some but loathed by others, but I urge parents never to let their kids watch South Park! IT-IS-NOT-A-KID'S-SHOW!!!",NA,"28 May 1999"
"286","Most people misjudge shows like this and you honestly can't blame theme: there's graphic scenes, some sexuality and explicit material, racism, and a good deal of swearing. I was once one of those people who would think of south park and just say, 'what the hell are people watching these days?' And I am now really ashamed of myself for misunderstanding something I didn't even watch before. One day, while being bored on a late night, I skimmed through the channels and watched one episode. I instantly fell in love with the crazy story lines, characters, humor, and references to real life issues and people. All in all, its really not that stupid. I praise the creators for their intelligence. Sometimes, well most of the time, at the end of a south park episode, I find myself learning something I hadn't known while at the same time having lots of fun since the show is so random and hilarious. If you haven't watched an episode, go to the website and watch one now or go on comedy central or something. You won't regret it.","10","13 June 2010"

"288","Some of you might be thinking that South Park has lost its edge. I, on the other hand, think exactly the opposite; South Park is getting better. From a viewpoint of someone saying ""South Park is just mindless garbage about farting and cursing"", South Park has definitely gotten more intelligent. It's gone political, but to the point where it's not preachy, but just poking fun at things. It dropped the whole kenny dying every episode and Cartman saying ""I'm not fat, I'm big-boned"" jokes.Some may say that Southpark changed it's ways. It did. It got more mature. You have to admit, the kenny deaths were getting a bit old. I liked how they mixed it up and made Cartman eat Kenny and have him permanently die for awhile. It definitely shows maturity and that they're ready to be more serious, seriously funny that is. From the standpoints of long-time dedicated fans, the show has definitely stayed true. Same kind of humor, just taken up an intellect level. I've been a fan since the Mr.Hankey episode in Season 1. I watched it on Christmas Eve and I've been in love with the show ever since. I can't believe it's gone this far. I remember thinking the ""Cartman's mom is a slut"" episode was new. But it's been almost ten full years since they began, and they've come a long way. And because of the way they're going and the fact that they do current events, they can go on for as long as they want. Frankly, I don't want to see the day where I turn on the television and read ""South Park Series Finale."" My heart would sink. Honestly, this is my all-time favorite shows and I don't think i have it in me to say goodbye to it yet.",NA,"28 March 2007"
"289","One of the few things funnier than the South Park series is reading some of the criticism of the program -- mostly from people either too young or simply too unsophisticated to understand the humor.Now and then there is a dull episode, but not often. The majority of them are bitingly satirical essays and (believe it or not) extremely conservative. Pay attention to what follows after one of the kids says,""I think I've learned something today....""  One suspects this is to make sure the point, however subtle, isn't missed by the younger kids who they know are watching.  You rope them in with fart jokes, but you teach them something of value.Aside from the brilliantly-conceived and executed gems like the Elian Gonzalez parody (with Janet Reno in an Easter Bunny suit attacking the house with Easter Egg grenades), there are an amazing number of very common-sense, rationalist episodes carefully conceived to skewer many of the absurd popular icons (Streisand, Jennifer Anniston, Jennifer Lopez, ad nauseum) or equally absurd popular fallacies:  alien abductions, cattle mutilations, alternative medicine, crystal/aroma therapy, the ""recovered memory"" horsecrap, phony child abuse reporting, the over-glorified ""gay lifestyle, supernatural nonsense, and so forth. Like the old National Lampoon of the 70s, absolutely NOTHING is sacred. The Christmas episode where we visit Hell and meet the Kennedys and Princess Di (performing a sex act with another inhabitant) is a classic.This may not appeal to many -- the deeply religious, those too ignorant to catch the references, or those with only a vestigial sense of humor.  But who gives a **** about them anyway?",NA,"12 December 2001"
"290","The world is made up largely of those who hate South Park and those that love it. Many of the flaming criticisms posted here are obviously by the very young, who largely don't get most of it anyhow...even though they think they do.This is a combination of subtlety and sledge-hammer comedy.  Hiding under the bathroom humor and crude humor (and after all, that's mostly what 9-year-olds indulge in), there is -- as is rarely pointed out -- a lot of deeply moral and even instructional material. It's the only program on ANYWHERE that isn't afraid to take on the politically correct crap we're spoon-fed on every other channel.  Including that clever but oh-so-PC ""The Simpsons.""The ripping assaults on such social outrages as the rampant litigation aimed at our school systems, the ultra-PC B.S.that is fed to us (and our kids), the cheap pandering to any whining special-interest group (gays, cripples, foreigners, the elderly, organized religion), and so forth, are artfully conceived and masterfully done.  Even the dull-witted may get the message.If you want weak mush that won't offend anyone, watch the Simpsons. If you can take your comedy strong and undiluted, watch South Park.",NA,"12 December 2001"
"291","I had heard many things about this show. ""A kid dies in every episode, it's always winter, it's disgusting"". But I had never watched the show 'cause it's not on mexican TV (and I guess it will NEVER be on mexican TV). So, I decided to buy the ""Cartman's mom is a dirty slut"" video in a visit to LA, to finally discover this famous show. I couldn't believe what I had been missing! It's so hilarious! Definitely, an acid animation show that many people will find offensive. Just not me.I can't wait to order more videos online. I'm sure the South park movie won't be released here, but I sure have to see that movie!!! The posters were great, making fun of the ridiculous ad campaign for ""Armageddon"" last year.

I must warn you that this show is explicit, violent, crude, loud, obnoxious, offensive, and all those other fun things that our parents tried to keep us away from, but if you're looking for a good laugh while shunning morals and family values, look no further.  Matt and Trey have an incredible insight into american society, and to see what we all really look like, look no further than South Park.",NA,"20 December 1998"
"293","Having the ability to create comedy that results from presenting issues in an intelligently sarcastic way still does not conceal this fact well enough: This show has a very conservative and manipulative agenda. It is packaged so well that it has gone over most fans heads and they have swallowed it altogether. The show tries to take a self-righteous completely falsified neutral role and pretends it criticizes anyone and everyone. But when you take a closer look, you realize the producers/backers have very clear standpoints. After you start seeing this, the show becomes very annoying.I actually agree on some of the absurdities around us that the show points out well, and that is their strategy to lure fans in. If you agree with some of it, you will watch all of it, and laugh of the other horse sh""""t that gets thrown in here and there, until one day you don't find the horse sh""""t stinks as much. It is actually so acceptable you would bring it home for dinner. Three types of fans of this show in my opinion. I have met all three types. - The easily manipulated ones that think it is intelligent, well meaning, neutral comedy. - Airheads who think it is a funny cartoon and enjoy the funny voices and most basic comical aspects. - The ones that agree with the show's (not so perfectly) hidden attitude in the first place.Southpark, I don't appreciate your opinion being shoved down my throat, cowardly disguised as satire. You can be very good at making fun of things but you could still be a huge a-h""""le. No thank you for me. I have stopped watching. But here goes a bit of advice so you can keep your fans: Infantile ""I will show stuff other people won't so that makes me reeaally cool"" stops being funny after a couple of seasons. We have all seen stupid things like butt rape and rats eating face or vomit and poop and so on. It's no big deal. Kenny dies, you can do racist and sexist jokes, we get it. It's just boring. Think of something else or shut it down.","1","5 August 2017"
"294","When I first saw South Park, I was roughly the same age as the boys are. I saw it and couldn't help but feel like I had lost brain cells. It wasn't funny, it was poorly animated, it was full of needless swearing, toilet humor, and gratuitous violence. There was nothing to like about this show.Now, many years later, I get it.Zealots will see the episode which opened the floodgates to ""the 'S' word"" as an excuse to say a dirty word as many times as possible (I believe it was 159). However, it was really a commentary about the very concept of cursing. They will see the episode about the Nintendo Wii and be enraged that people have forsook God. In reality, it shows just how religious atheism is, and how petty religious war can be. They will see Satan having relationship troubles with Saddam Hussein and heat up at the mere fact that it shows Satan as having a heart. Truly, it shows that everyone has their differences, and that people shouldn't be dependent on relationships for happiness. Let's not think that only right-wing types might get offended though. The episode about hybrid cars exploits the tree-hugger stereotype. Al Gore has a few appearances, each more ridiculous than the last. Nothing is sacred on South Park.This show is truly an incredibly intelligent brand of satire, wrapped up in a skin of vulgarity and crudeness. I recently sat down and started watching it, and I have yet to find an episode I dislike. My personal favorite is ""Cartman Sucks"", which is unfortunately a very accurate satire of sexual conversion therapy. Then again, one of my favorite moments is in ""Jewbilee"", where it turns out a bear had been hunting young children not to eat, but to give her cub an entourage with whom to enjoy his birthday party.I just cannot say enough about this show. Look past the idiocy and see what is really being said, and I guarantee you'll love this show!","10","12 February 2008"
"295","This is a TV-show you will either love or hate I have spoken to so many people that hate the show (most are over the age of 29 but that's not relevant). The creators of south park are creative and at the same time witty and sarcastic, they brilliantly depict childhood as raw and cruel, when you think about it then you realize that kids are mean, although they don't mean to be. Kids have no sense of morality and therefore cannot understand the consequences of their actions/words. Everyone knows this and that is why people say ""come on he's just a kid"". Well believe it or not the 4 main characters in SP are kids and act like them, they just say what every kid thinks. Imdb commenters say that this show will never be as good as the Simpsons, I agree, but I think that one should not compare so completely different shows, it's like comparing ""driving miss daisy"" and ""silence of the lambs""! The drawings are terrible but that is only to further depict how raw it is and that the language and dialogue are the main subjects of the show.All in all lovable characters (especially Eric Cartman) and brilliantly sarcastic and nasty humor. 8/10",NA,"11 September 1999"
"296","i am not shameful to say that i have watched all the episodes of the 16 seasons, understanding some while confused by some others, due to the culture gap.i like the show itself because of the reasons already mentioned by the others and many more.US TV shows are very popular in mainland china. here what shows you are watching is often a register to demonstrate your social status in your taste and whether you are up to date in following the fads. the sequence in watching TV shows from high to low is British show viewer-US-Japanese Korean-HK/Taiwan/Singapore-mainland Chinese-Thailand. viewers are just crazy. they waited online the whole night for a new episode to be posted, watched it without any Chinese sub-tiles, watched it again when the version with Chinese translation sub-tiles is released.the hits include Prison Break, Lost, Friends, Homeland and many others. SP and another one Mad Men are not so popular, since they might be too culturally loaded that they are rather hard to understand.apart from all the praise the former reviews heaping on the show i can still add quite a few.no one mentions the opening disclaimer of the show. have you ever seen that before? it gives you a hint in what style the show is going to be.besides its staggering AC Nelson Ratings (more than 13 with the episode who is Cartmen's Father), the show gets responds from the academics, with books analyzing and discussing it, like Pychology in SP.what is amusing is when i happened to come across a short clip of porn, the 18 year old heroine tells the camera she likes SP most when interviewed.just like the characters in Friends, here in SP, the smart one might do something stupid, while the mean might offer a hand to the needy. no one is perfect and even the most hated might do something good. they are surreal most of the time and at one point they are just the guys cross the road. to sum up, whether you love or hate the show, you have to admit it that in one way or another, you are the very person depicted in the show,be it mean, ignorant, stupid, racist or anything.","9","9 March 2013"

"299","The show is basically about four kids walking around getting into trouble, bad mouthing people and racial groups as they go along. It's a comedy, although I seem to be one of those people who can sit through a whole episode without even smirking, it's just not that funny!Trey Parker and Matt Stone have really gone too far. This is perhaps the most annoying show I've personally ever seen. It's badly done, and most of the jokes aren't even that funny. For example, Chef's songs are funny for the first few times, then they kind of get boring, and they they get bad-bad-bad! Isaac Hayes is a very talented man, a great person! Unfortunately, now he's only going to be remembered for this cartoon! People won't think of him when they hear Shaft, they'll think of a badly drawn chef! It's upsetting to think about.I can't see South Park will still be going after the year 2000. After they've made the movie, people will look at it and think ""What was I doing? This is getting boring!"" just like how people did with the Spice Girls!How many times can you kill Kenny? I mean, how many different ways is there to kill someone? It's gonna get dull, seeing this kid get sliced up every episode. I'm not going to say South Park will die tomorrow, but one day we will turn our backs and say ""To hell with you!"", and that'll be it for South Park.All in all, I'd say it's originality will eventually fade, but for now we're pretty much stuck with it.

"300","When I 1st overheard this show, my kneejerk reaction to the abrasive-seemingly pottymouthed juveniles was ""What the ""F"" is this!?"" That's probably what a lot of people think when they overhear it being watched by me. Eric Cartman's raspy voice laced w/ expletives, & Kyle or Stan saying ""Shut up Fat@$$!"". What brought it around was that the main thing they ripped on was not the voice of reasoning, or traditional values, but political correctness, sacred cows, & demogoguery. Namely things that deserve to be ripped on. The general impression of the show is not that it liked conservatives, but it hated liberals more. The main way it ripped on conservatives was all the redneck(bad conservative stenotype)overtones.This ""cartoon"" is an ironic exception to my agreement w/ statements that classic 60's cartoons like Underdog, Jonny Quest, The Flintstones, Secret Squirrel, Fat Albert(70's?) & the like monopolized on teaching good moral values. Southpark may not be as wholesome(understatement of the century), but it ultimately teaches good moral lessons, at least in the sense that it UNteaches bad ones. I think the episode that brought me around was ""Sexual Harassment Panda"" & the way it ripped on reckless litigation. The one where Eric Cartman was busted for a hate crime because a boy he hit was black was also good.The kid's influence brought reasoning about in these episodes. There was one where the kids were helping Gloria Alred pass laws to force the Boy Scouts to accept a homosexual Scout leader. I thought SP was going to lean to the left. But it was the rejected homosexual who was the voice of reason, saying that the Scouts had the same right to free expression as he did & he didn't want to use force of law to make the Scouts change their religious base.","7","2 October 2006"

"302","In '97, Matt Stone and Trey Parker set out to make an animated series that would rival THE SIMPSONS. And to date, they're still chugging along. During the early years, their team used the most basic of animation techniques (everything looks like construction paper cut-outs) to create a world of demented, quirky citizens all living in the fictional Colorado town of South Park. More recently, the team has discovered CGI. Which has further helped them envision the town and characters more thoroughly. Typically, here's how an episode goes: The four main characters: boys Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman, get mixed up in some sort of shenanigans; the town gets threatened by some kind of disaster; and usually, Kenny dies in some inventive way. Almost all the jokes are adult-themed, clearly not for children. Usually, there's a smattering of socially-relevant current topics that crop up in the show. Most of the time, there's no plot to speak of. There's also a healthy dose of profanity and scatological humor (fart and poop jokes are their favorite). Like with any TV series, some episodes are hits while others are misses. However, there is one episode that stands as their finest work: ""MAKE LOVE, NOT WARCRAFT"" that parodies on-line gaming.

Since no book can be judged by its cover, there for no TV show can be criticized just by rumors or by watching only 2-3 episodes and I'm no exception. So I've forced myself to watch at least one season as my friends told me just to give it a fair chance to see will I find it amusing as much as everyone talked me about it. I had not, not a slightest bit. Why? I'll try to be as shorter with this text as I can, so that no one falls asleep while reading it. So...here goes.By reading my title someone will probably think that I'm some ""fine nurtured"" person who is grossed out by loads of swearing, vulgarity and ironical morbidness of this show. It's not like that at all. Why I gave it such low vote is not because of constant badmouthing during episodes. No, it's 'cause of it's thematics. We all well know the world we live in is worst than hell itself, we're all well aware of awkward and ironic society that we can see each and every day, we know about constant nonsenses that's been delivered to us through media, etc, etc, etc. We got the point already. I'm not gonna say that each animated feature should talk about ""good vs evil"" or something behind the mask just to satisfy crowd. Of course not. But neither it should be like this. It is not as smart as it's treated and if you turn your brain for a second, you're realize that this what's put to irony and laugh here is actually more to cry than to laugh about. Haven't we all been fed up by this world's dirt in our everyday lives. I watched the show as I've spoke...ho, I understand it's meanings, understand that the idea is to put our human stupidity to laugh and by doing that make us viewers laugh at ourselves and the society we live in. Right? Figured it out by watching one episode. That's okay, but why repeating it all the time, what's the point of it if I may ask? Will it really make us feel all that better if we're just going to laugh at ourselves and the world around us, will we make things more right and better just by laughing at them. Honestly I don't know how any person who calls itself intelligent could find this amusing. By this I really have no intention to offend anyone. Obviously this is the easiest way of dealing with problems and that's exactly and IMHO the only thing that this show manages to point out in somehow funny way. It shows personality of the majority. It shows how most of people're enjoying and laughing in massive amount of irony and sarcasm. It's showing that most of us is actually no different than the ones that this kind of show puts to laugh. If you know what I mean. And for that and only that I'll give it a credit, but again, it has no deeper meaning than this and it surely won't make us any smarter.Overall...this show is greatly overrated. It's nothing more than average and sometimes even quite dumb sometimes and by this I don't have an intention to offend anyone.","1","21 February 2011"
"308","This has got to be the dumbest tv show ever created.  How many times can ""Oh my god, they killed Kenny"" be funny.  And they make what, like 4 new episodes a year???  It is stupid, plain stupid.  I forced myself to watch it once or twice with a friend, but i didnt hardly even giggle or make a smirk, it was not funny.  This is just my opinion, if you like it, by all means watch it, but i think it is dumb.",NA,"7 November 2001"
"309","I remember as a kid, when this first came out in the late 90's, and I think it was kind of a naughty thing to watch that our young minds didn't quite get, in the same way the early SNL was to our parents. but this....this is about 1000 times worse in its content then probably any TV show ever created before it, even the Simpson's. when i finally ""grew up"" i saw this show for what it really is. at first i think we all thought because its a cartoon and its a little bit more adult its still kinda funny. but of course they went into religion bashing, racist jokes, ethnic jokes of all kinds, blasphemous language and plots, especially the whole devil and Jesus thing, was so completely wrong. i never like to say this but I've never seen 2 guys so willingly wanting to go to hell. this is what happens when perverts get free reign on television. i read one ""hate"" post below that said the reasons they hated the show Weren't because they were a ""fine nurtured person who is grossed out by loads of swearing, vulgarity and ironical morbidness of this show"". well, I am that person. I was raised in a Christian home and had a great mother who taught me the ways to be a good honest person in life and not to be a foul mouthed moron like many others out there who have no life including those who created this show. not saying I'm Mr. Perfect by any means, but trying to live to the standards set by God the best to my ability. but at some point you have to open your eyes to the sick culture your in and give a critique of it. i mean look at how far we've come. we went from TV shows like ""i love Lucy"", genuine Christian based shows on national TV like ""little house on the prairie"", corny yet fun, child safe action shows from the 80's like Macgyver and A team. then in the 90's we saw just how much you can show on TV and just how much you can get away with on TV. faux kid looking shows like The Simpsons i never got into because it was the precursor to the crude nasty shows like south park and family guy, only a little bit lighter and not nearly as crude or offensive, though it did come close. but i still found it unsettling. then the big one, south park, that ushered in a whole generation of nasty, foul mouthed piggish kids and complete lack of morality. seeing absolute crap shows like this and looking back at the shows of yesteryear, its a sad, sad reminder of how far down the toilet bowl our culture has gone and even scarier about where its going. there is some sinister work being done in the media today to undermine God and common decency and have complete and utter chaos sweep our once great society. i hope people will wake up soon and realize what junk we have been feeding our culture for many years now and that we need a return to decency and morality on television, not to mention our society.",NA,"16 January 2013"
"310","I have been reading the comments on this show and I think the people who do not like this show are obviously very confused and there are a few things they do not understand.1) South Park is not trying to be like the Simpsons. These 2 cartoons have NOTHING in common except for the fact that they are both animated. Thats it...nothing else. 2)The poor animation is obviously is done purposely. After all its not the animation that makes us laugh. It's all the crude jokes. This show is one of the highest rated on TV and the makers are making MILLIONS. Some of the most prestigious in Hollywood have made appearances on this show. Elton John,Jennifer Anniston,George Clooney,KORN,etc.. 3) The characters walking sideways are simply a trademark of the show. Kind of like the Simpsons ugly irritating cone shape heads and that annoying baby constantly sucking on that pacifier. You have to appreciate the humor of this show. All the classic one-liners and I think the characters were all so well developed. Mr. Garrison is the funniest closet-case homo character on TV. And they have tried to make light of some very serious real-life situations. Assisted suicide, The depletion of the rainforests,spontanious combustion,beastiality....which is obviously a sick, but funny joke.This is sort of like Howard Stern.....many people watch it for shock value...you are simply waiting to see what these little kids are going to do next. I watch it because its funnier than hell and very enjoyable.Like Howard Stern...if you don't like it, then don't watch it.",NA,"21 December 1999"
"311","After reading a lot of the user comments on how great this show is I came to the conclusion that it must be because it's so straightforward.. Sh#"", Di#¤, F¤%# and other obscene words are said over and over again. So where the he""#¤ is the funny part! Is it because most of you people have such a simple humor that you simply can't understand more complex humor from other series like The Simpsons??. And another thing. Some of you say that Simpsons and South Park is the same, well forget about it! It's not nearly the same! In South Park the animations suck, the humor is for kids with no vocabulary at all - only obscene words which of course they think are soooo funny (??) and most of all the whole concept!! Two guys are making BIG BUCKS off making the most crappy cartoon ever! And you like because of a couple off crude words once in a while .... Wake up!!!",NA,"15 February 2000"
"312","It's foul degrading nonsense, they mask their contempt for everyone with jokes, and if you look a little deeper you'll see they are without any integrity at all, they have no principles or values, it's an indictment of a sick society.","1","14 February 2021"
"313","There's been a lot of moral outrage about South Park right from the very start. This has mainly centered around the fact that there's a lot of swearing. When there are positive comments in the media they usually focus solely on the fact that Kenny dies in every episode. This is doing a great disservice to a show that is essentially the second best animation ever.The main thing that people seem to be mistaken over is the idea that South Park has no intelligence and is merely an excuse to make rude jokes for a teenage audience. In actual fact South Park is frequently very clever indeed and the constant flashes of surrealism mark it out as far funnier than the majority of 'worth' sitcoms. And South Park also has a surprisingly strong sense of morals - almost every single episode has some kind of moral, and occasionally these can be as preachy as the bible bashers that disparage it. In some cases the only difference is that one group has an incredibly foul mouth...and the other one consists of four young boys living in Colorado.South Park is consistently funny and permanently smart. It quite honestly deserves almost as large an audience as The Simpsons (though obviously not the kiddies) as it is sometimes equally brilliant in its satire of just about everything in this modern world.",NA,"8 May 2003"
"314","The 3rd season was very bad. The 4th season was a little better, but since the film, the show just has not been the same. Last night, I saw the first episode of the new season. Kenny is not in the intro this year, and it seems he is gone for good, thank god. Timmy is a much funnier character. Butters is always good for a laugh.The Simpsons are the royal family of animated TV, but this show does have its moments. If the rest of this season, and yes they do make more than 4 shows a season, is like last night, the spark may be back.I have never been offended by the show, I am old enough (31) to think for myself, and I take responsibility for my own actions. TV, music, and games are not my cop-outs to scapegoat all my failures on. If you do not like the show, do not watch it. To call fans of the show names, and imply that they (me) lack gray matter upstairs only shows your own insecurities, and maybe provides some insight into your other ""short-comings"". Digital Cable/Sat. TV have 200 plus stations for a reason. There is usually something on, at any time, for everybody. Go watch what you want, and leave SP alone.",NA,"8 March 2002"
"315","this is by far one of the best shows out. just for the sake that they have no boundaries. unfortunately their new episodes are a bit poor because they need to be more ... offensive thats what makes south park great its offensiveness. if you get offended by it don't watch it simples. that is in my opinion need to do and in their new season they need to be more offensive and with that comes the laughs.other than that their old episodes are bloody brilliant only their newest season was poor the rest were brilliant. congrats to the creators. the best characters in this show has to be Randy and Cartman.p.s if you haven't seen this show ... watch it watch it NOW !!!!!","10","8 August 2013"
"316","Around where I work I would sometimes hear my buddies talking about South Park. i would think to myself why would they want watch that? But then one night I was flipping through channels I found an episode of south park. Since there was nothing else on I decided to watch it. It was the episode called an elephant makes love to a pig. I cracked up at it. And soon I really got into the show! (When I watch something and like it I get into it) Every now and then there is a bad episode like the vampire one eat pray queef or the china one but usually the show is hilarious. My favorite episodes are Somalian Pirates we, fishsticks and the passion of the Jew","8","26 June 2009"
"317","I love this show and Cartman is very funny when he sang a song about Kyle's mom.I think that Trey & Matt should get an emmy for the best cartoon series.I love South Park.A+",NA,"21 January 2000"
"318","I started watching South Park right when I was a senior in high-school, mainly as an act of defiance- it was rated TV-MA and most people said it mainly revolved around absurd story lines with generous amounts of crude and offensive humor, and fart jokes thrown in. Being a fan of comedies like Borat, The Dictator, and American Pie, I was naturally attracted. However, I discovered, after watching a few episodes, that the opinions of my friends were rather ungrounded. Though 'Park' does really have absurd story lines, crude and offensive humor, and fart jokes, it actually serves as one of the most intelligent satires on television today. Taking full advantage of the freedom Comedy Central gave them, Trey Parker and Matt Stone went on to fully tackle issues which no one else would touch and leap over lines other shows wouldn't dare cross. The fart and sex jokes aren't there for the heck of it, they actually have some substance in them. Whats really sad is that this show has been misunderstood so much that its been discredited, when this show really is pure genius.The show takes place in a crazy little mountain town in Colorado where four 3rd graders live. Eric Cartman is the portrayal of bigotry and ignorance in the show- as he's an obese, obnoxious, ignorant little assh*le who everybody else hates. Kyle Broflovski is the cartoon projection of co-creator Matt Stone, as Stan Marsh is of Trey Parker, and they are often used as the mouthpieces of their philosophies, morals, and messages. Kenny McCormick is the fourth member of the group, who besides being poor and perverted, dies in many episodes, as is a running gag in the show. Also besides them is the gay redneck Mr. Garrison, the black pimp Chef, the sweet innocent Butters, the strong and independent Wendy Testaburger, and the goofy laugh-riot Randy Marsh.From Catholicism to Scientology, from censorship to propaganda, from Pokemon to World Of Warcraft, from Obama to Osama, Park's story lines transcend almost every topic or current event that needs ripping on or evaluation. And if its not that, the show deals with the kids just being kids, and the characters interacting with each other in silly situations.Personally I have watched over 200 episodes of Park and it still hasn't failed me in terms of its originality and freshness. I definitely recommend this show to teens at least over 15. You will never look back.10/10","10","31 October 2013"
"319","I've been watching South Park since I first heard the uproarious laughter emiting throughout the living room last year. I walk in to see what's making my parents crack up like that- and I see a bunch of HORRIBLY drawn lil' 8 year old punks swearing their way through a half hour of crass and vulgar jokes... and guess what.. I LOVE IT! To all who say that the four lil monsters don't have a personality would be like SAYING Monica Lewinsky isn't a fat .... (sorry too much south park.. heh heh..) You have Cartman the fatt-ass, rude, obnoxious and disgusting pig- who's also somewhat enderaing. Kyle the neurotic and smart Jew- with a mother who's a perfect mockery of all the ridiculous TV censoring parents out there that really think they can control US? (ha) who's best friends with a piece of crap. Stan the lover of the bunch who's Grampa wants to die, sister beats the tar out of him and his girlfriend can't get close to him without getting puked on. Kenny almost always dies yadda yadda we know that but it's still great:) Now to my complaint- does anyone else think the ""quality"" of the shows is slipping ridiculously? I could watch ""Mr Hankey the Christmas Poo"" & ""Starvin Marvin"" a million billion times and not get tired of it (as with MOST of the first season) but I can't watch ""Clubhouse"" ""the fourth of july"" or ""mr hankey returns"" without moaning... ungh.. turn it off. This season has really sucked- making us wait FOREVER for new episodes and constantly playing reruns... I think I only liked 3 episodes this season ""Chicken Pox"" (a classic!) ""Spooky Fish"" and ""the gnomes"" (great song):) I just hope Trey and Matt put more thought in the 3rd season then they have in their merchandise. I'd take Simpson's Sounds of Springfield over Chef's Aid anyday (with the exception of wake up wendy and eric's sailing away)",NA,"12 January 1999"
"320","This show is amazing. Not only does it expose controversial topics for the stupidity it is but it sets it in a comedic setting.

"322","I have read many reviews, mostly positive, about South Park. Although the reviews were well written and informative in most cases, not even one review mentioned the true brilliance of the show. The characters and the voices. My two favourites are Cartman and Butters. Trey Parker is a god. I could never have imagined the day I would enjoy an animated character as much as Bugs Bunny. I was wrong. Eric has made me laugh in hysterics like Bugs never could. The subtleties are priceless. I especially like when he talks in his soft whinny voice when he wants something. He is no cliché in any way that I'm aware of. Originality is the purest form of genius.","10","11 July 2005"
"323","I'm bored watching this show, now. Been watching since day one, have all the shows on DVD, used to love it. Thought it was landmark but now it's just dull. Not only that but anything political is completely overblown, shoehorned and one sided, that side being anti-Trump (which can't be done with the actual president as that would be difficult to make a joke of, instead opting for the character on the show who used to be a joke on cross dressers, perverts and deviants to be an alternate universe stand in because the jokes the character used to be in aren't PC anymore). The messaging of the stories is confused and the conclusions are baffling. I don't enjoy watching it anymore and it's a chore to get through and I'm only persisting because I paid for the season box. It'll be the last I buy.","3","5 May 2020"
"324","I have been hearing a lot of bad reviews about this show saying that it is nothing but toilet humour, swearing and fart jokes, well all those reviewers can screw themselves! Because i can guarantee you that beneath the offencive language lies huge laughs! South park is so sadly misunderstood by so many people. South park delivers that kind of wall to wall comedy that will leave you in stitches! Every episode has been a classic from season 1 to season 11, i could not find one episode in that i did not laugh. Im serious! As soon as i watched one episode of South park I've been trying to see them all, and i guarantee it will happen to you.

"325","South Park is amazing satire that takes the dumbest aspects of modern society and lampoons them with witty and thought provoking commentary and morals it's a million times better than family guy and will still be relevant long after the Simpsons ends if it ever does this is a show that people will use 200 years from now to study our culture and is absolutely timeless a world without South Park is a darker world indeed","10","7 July 2019"
"326","I just want to say that South Park is a great show. I can't believe that anyone would not like it. First of all, South Park deals with issues and combines them with light humor.I don't believe that South Park is a racist show at all. It has, in some shows, used racism to illustrate points and to prove issues, but never to put down anybody.I find it hard to believe that people say that the Simpsons are better than South Park. The Simpsons stereo-types Indians as convenient store workers, Australians as old fashion and country folk, fat people as dumb, and it puts down many more groups of people.After reading what other people's comments are, it is obvious that South Park is aimed at a certain group of people, and deals with issues related to those types of people. Not everyone will like South Park.If you have never watched South Park, or only watch a few episodes and hate it, I suggest that you watch more. I know a few people who had never watched it, and from what they had heard didn't want to watch it, however when they watched a few episodes they enjoyed it. So at least give it a go!",NA,"11 January 1999"
"327","Sorry if I can't conform with everybody else who has reviewed this but I really can't see what's so funny about this show!!! As far as I am concerned 'South Park' represents everything that it wrong with TV today! I hate it with a vengeance!!!! As far as I'm concerned it is nothing more than cheap trash that thanks advantage of disturbing political and moral situations in a desperate attempt to entertain people. Don't get me wrong I am up for a laugh and I have to admit that there are a few moments in this show that did make me smile. But these moments are few and far between and often undermined by something terribly disgusting. There is no way that this show compares to other American cartoons that really can be classed as funny... such as 'Family Guy' and 'The Simpsons'! I'm sorry that I don't have much more to say on this show. I definitely wouldn't recommend this show to people, but I also understand that not everybody thinks as I do... each to out own I suppose.",NA,"27 November 2005"

Line that most caught my attention: Ms. Crabtree: Sit down!  Stan: Ah, whatever you fat b*^ch.  Reply: What did you say!?  Stan: I said I have a bad itch.  Everyone in the room cracked up at that one, but all they said was ""South Park.""  Basically, I'm left in the dark with it.  Eventually, I asked one of my friends about it, who said ""Comedy Central.""  But, I still didn't get to see it til July '98.  I was home from summer school that day (summer school AAAHHHHHHHH) with really bad muscle cramps and was in bed all day.  My friend said that South Park is on Wednesday at 9:00.  First episode I saw, Chicken Lover, I had to suffer through.  Why?  My back hurt worse every time I laughed.  It was hysterical. I watched it the next week too, and was then hooked on it.

"331","South Park is an American animated television comedy series about four third/fourth-grade school boys who live in the small, backward mountain town of South Park, Colorado. The series was created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and has been distributed and aired by Comedy Central since 1997. The show is well-known for its pop-culture parody, scatological humor, and satirical handling of current events.Irrespective of whether , its the over rated campaigning for votes or its the intolerance of some rednecks for other communities, South Park has targeted them all. The makers have made the best use of their freedom of expression and have brought all kinds of prejudices to their knees by making an episode about each topic absolutely hilarious nailing the prejudice on the head.Many communities did not welcome it as it just brought forward their prejudices and pointed it right on its face.On August 26, 2007, it was revealed that Parker and Stone, South Park's creators, had renewed their contracts for a 15th season, running through 2011. In recent years, each season has been aired in two halves, in spring and in autumn, with a summer hiatus. The eleventh season began airing on March 7, 2007, and is set to follow this system. The first half of the eleventh season ended on April 18, 2007, and is scheduled to begin again on October 3, 2007.South Park's early episodes tended to be shock value-oriented and featured more Pythonesque humor than later episodes. Although satire had been used on the show occasionally in its early and middle years, it became more evident around the seventh season. Episodes have parodied Michael Jackson (in ""The Jeffersons""), Paris Hilton (""Stupid Spoiled W*ore Video Playset""), The Passion of the Christ (in ""The Passion of the Jew""), and American immigration policy (""Goobacks"").Prior to season four, the main characters of the show were four third grade students (often called ""the boys"" when as a group for easier reference): Stanley ""Stan"" Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Theodore Cartman and Kenneth ""Kenny"" McCormick. There are many recurring characters on the show, including the boys' families, school staff and other students. These include Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch, Chef, Mr. Hankey, Towelie, Jesus, and Satan. There are also many other minor characters.South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is an Academy Award-nominated animated satirical comedy/musical film released in 1999 and based on the animated television series South Park. The film parodies animated Disney films such as Beauty and the Beast as well the Broadway musical Les Misérables. It features 12 songs by Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman. The song ""Blame Canada"" was nominated for an Academy Award. The film was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for frequent coarse language, crude sexual humor and violence.It was nominated for Best Song, Blame Canada was performed by Robin Williams at the Academy Awards.The film caused little controversy in Canada even though it poked fun at the country. Canadian Consul General (and former Prime Minister) Kim Campbell noted that the song ""Blame Canada"" did not offend her since it was clearly a silly satirical song not intended to insult her country. Well-known Canadian singer Anne Murray allayed concern about the fact that the song referred to her as a ""bitch"" by indicating that she wasn't offended by the tongue-in-cheek lyric. Murray was invited to sing the song on the Oscar telecast but declined due to a prior commitment. Robin Williams ended up singing it.I would suggest South Park to all Mature Audience who are willing to go beyond their everyday TV and movies to try this classic (series or the movie). I know I loved it.","9","23 September 2007"

There isn't a single race, religion, political group, sexuality, gender, nationality, celebrity etc etc that it doesn't make fun of. The show even pops fun at itself in some episodes, signalling to the world that they themselves are open to ridicule. If you think the show has a nasty message about a certain group then your just not getting it and i'm glad you have ceased watching and have moved on to more brain numbing programmes that don't cause you to think (might I recommend 'Friends').","6","30 June 2017"

Nothing like chewing on a box, and eating carpet to make you laugh...Poor Kenny.  He has the worst things happen to him just because he is poor.If you have not seen this series, you should.

"336","I have tried, really tried to understand why South Park is so popular but the only conclusion I can come to is that it is popular for the same reason that tabloid newspapers and reality TV are popular: it appeals to the brain dead masses who have no more than 2 neurons to rub together. The scripts are plain, banal and boring; any approaches to humour are pathetic and predictable. Its political satire, much vaunted by many of the reviews, is about as insightful as that provided by Star Wars or the National Enquirer. It's not even bad enough to be funny in the sense of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". It just ""is"", in the sense of something taking up space for no useful purpose.",NA,"17 June 2005"
"337","This show is SO FUNNY!!! Yes, a little offensive. Yes, a little crude. Yes, the animation sucks. But, well, I don't know how they did it, but Trey Parker and Matt Stone turned these bad things into the funniest show ever made in history. I just started watching it recently when we got DirecTV, and I just LOVE it. I watch every episode.People who say that Kenny's dying in every episode gets boring, that's part of what makes the show so good. Just look at Home Improvement. The fact that you never see Wilson's entire face is part of what makes it so good. The same thing goes with Frasier. You never see Maris. It's just one of those things.Well, I am still a big Simpsons fan, King of The Hill sucks though. I can't believe that after 10 years, there hasn't been a Simpsons Movie! South Parks been on for only a few years and they're ALREADY making a movie. The reason is that they probably waited too long to have the idea of a Simpsons movie that now they don't have any ideas. They're already running out of ideas for the show.Well anyway, South Park RULES!!!",NA,"3 January 1999"

"340","I'll give this show credit that during the first season (1997-1998), this TV show seemed to be the best.  It was funny because one could relate to it. It seemed to have everything.  Everyone thought it could topple the legendary ""Simpsons"".  That was in the years of '97-'98.I was once a fan of South Park.  I watched it because everyone else did. When it came on, I would tune in.  But no more.  On many Anti-South Park sites, they mention the ""Death"" episode as a spoof of the speakers against cartoon violence.  A lot of recent cartoons have already done episodes like it (Simpsons, Tiny Toon Adventures, Beavis and Butt-head among them) but unlike them, as one previous person commented, Terrance and Philip are not spoofs of Beavis and Butt-head.  They're an answer to those who think South Park is nothing but fart jokes.  I didn't understand it at first.  But as I continued reading, the episode was not to deliver a message about cartoon violence.  Its purpose was a self-promotional bit: to mock those who hate South Park, accepting no tolerance of criticism!  That's one out of many reasons why ""South Park"" will never beat ""The Simpsons"": it can mock everyone, but it can't laugh at it's own flaws.The first bad choice made had to be the swapping of the second half of ""Cartman's mom is a dirty slut"" with that Terrance and Philip junk ""Not Without My Anus"" (Hope you didn't break your TVs over it.)  Then, the lackluster second season came in.  I know they wanted to save their best jokes for the movie, but I never laughed, gasped, etc. at it, either. 
After that, South Park's popularity was, in a way, gone.  In just April, 1998, they lost 46% of their ratings.  It was almost embarrassing to watch anymore.  Also, it wants to shock everyone, but it sometimes wimps out.  In ""Jakovasaurs"" (ho-ho), the annoying characters eventually leave by being shipped to....France!  Why France?  Why not Germany or Spain, where it COULD be offensive?  I'll tell you: the French can take a joke.  With the other two, you need to be choosey, because some jokes upset the Germans, and the Spanish just wouldn't stand for it.I know the show will last probably 3 years at best (emphasized by MAD magazine, who quotes: Dumb element of TV, #38: Comedy Central's choice to renew the tiresome, repetitive ""South Park"" for three more years despite the fact no one cares about it anymore after its massive overexposure in only 2 years).  But the fans won't.In 1999, I swore off the show.  I liked it, but I'm starting to hate it. It's not funny anymore.  The characters are just getting dumber and more irritating.  The jokes are stuff little kids laugh at.  It's now a cartoon that does anything for a cheap laugh or two.  Compared to ""Simpsons"", ""South Park"" is just a diversion.  It won't last.  The movie pounded the final nail in the South Park coffin.  After that movie, it should've just died.

"341","I want to know why I'm seeing comments all over the place that the show is going downhill! South Park, like any other enduring show, does start to become tiresome, I'll admit. But South Park has proven itself by not putting out crappy episode after crappy episode, like the 12th and 13th seasons of The Simpsons. Just look at episode 611-The Great Wall/Kidnapping episode. This has to be one of my all-time favorite episodes! I have on my computer every South Park episode ever made, and there are very few crappy ones, especially in the new season! So all of you out there who say the show sucks now, or has always sucked, stop being so pompous and arrogant, and just sit down, watch the show, and laugh. Simple as that!",NA,"11 November 2002"
"342","I'm an all time South Park fan in the sense that i enjoyed their show starting from my early teen years. The show also formed my own 'dark' humor to some point and i do thank them for that. However, it has become clear that this show has run its course. Maybe i'm getting 'too old' for South Park but it is abundantly clear that they have run out of ideas. This current season (21) has some of the worst writing i've seen of the show. I don't wanna go into detail (since I'm a bit lazy) but you should check for yourself if you agree. In a nutshell, they can't comment on social/political events anymore in a clever and comprehensive manner nor do they have the ability to write stand-alone episodes that are entertaining at this point. A constantly farting opiod dealing elderly woman might have been fun a few years ago, but now it falls short in comedic value. The fact that she has urine stains on her dress is almost a stigma of the aggression, frustration and desperation the creators have in dealing with their writers-block. I'm referencing the latest episode here btw. Maybe its because we live in a 'Trump era' that makes South Park loses its punch or inspiration. Maybe i am getting too old. In any case, South Park deserves a great finale and i really hope they go out with a bang. Worst case scenario..they continue on this path of mediocrity and operating as a shallow shadow of its former self...","1","20 October 2017"

"344","SP is sooo immature and juvenile but still makes me wet my pants at the age of 23. the only problem is that it has taken the same path as the simpsons: it goes for shock value nowadays rather than comedy. there is a noticeable trend towards more shocking violence and disgusting situations than early episodes. its an obvious sign of parker and stone's running out of ideas and i have no doubt it will go the way of the simpsons if it continues. whereas the simpsons took a few seasons to warm up and find its feet, SP started at its peak and has steadily gone downhill. if trey and matt care about their creation more than the money they should give it one or more seasons then stop.",NA,"27 December 2004"
"345","One of the golden rules of television comedy (and one of the rules least heeded) is this - when you run out of things to say, shut up. John Cleese apparently called a halt to the delirious FAWLTY TOWERS after only a dozen episodes, because only twelve things annoyed him about hotels, and once he'd worked out those grievances, there was nothing more to add. That's why FAWLTY TOWERS remains a classic. There was no jumping the shark, no undignified senescence, no ratings decline. Ideally, SOUTH PARK should have ended after the first thirteen episodes, leaving its mark on comedy history as a hilarious smash and grab raid on pop culture, American morals and political correctness. Had that been the case, it would still be revered as a classic to this day. Unfortunately, its creators Parker and Stone realised there was a huge cash cow in their midst begging to be milked regularly, and the world promptly sank under a welter of t-shirts, dolls, spin-off albums (their decision to rescue coke-addled wife-beater Ike Turner from obscurity on the Chef Aid disaster speaks volumes about their warped sense of 'cool'), posters, stickers and God knows what else, most - if not all - of it aimed at prepubescent kids. Early fans, who struggled through Channel Four's erratic scheduling and lack of sleep to catch the first run, got their first whiff of high-smelling excreta when series two limped into 'action' with a Terrance and Phillip 'special'. Yes, thanks guys, twenty-two minutes of sped-up Canadian voices, worse animation than usual and fart gags. Go ahead and insult our intelligence, have fun, I'm sure the rest of the series will be better. When the rest of the series turned out to be dismal, the damage was done. People jumped off the SOUTH PARK bandwagon in droves, and although the third and fourth seasons offered isolated moments of bad-taste fun (Cartman inadvertently joining NAMBLA being a particularly warped highlight), the glory days were dead and gone. The movie, unsurprisingly, ran out of steam after the first twenty minutes, and expected adults to laugh at the sight of a small boy watching his mother eating feces on a German fetish website. In their endless desire to be perceived as 'cool' by the world's immature teenagers, Parker and Stone painted themselves into a corner and fell asleep, leaving the coast clear for the far more intelligent, ballsy and tightly-written FAMILY GUY to replace their paean to bad taste in the hearts and minds of discerning viewers on both sides of the Atlantic. I've read that they hate Seth MacFarlane's subversive satire, for what the opinions of a the one-trick lame donkeys behind ORGASMO and BASEKETBALL are worth. Probably not enough poop jokes or ejaculating dogs for them.I never liked THE SIMPSONS - too arch and self-referential for me - but in the final analysis, SOUTH PARK stands as the bigger disappointment because it took a giant, corporate-sponsored dump on the very people it initially set out to entertain. Screw Parker and Stone, I'm going home.",NA,"28 March 2006"
"346","Kind of pointless to even review South Park since so many before have done it. But I don't watch a lot of TV, but South Park is one thing i never miss. It's funny, when i first watched it I wasn't very old - I still loved it, because of the crude humor and because my parents disliked it. I remember looking at clips on the internet where Kenny died just laughing about that and discussing it with friends. Now I'm older (19years old) but not a lot more mature apparently, because I still love the crude humor (not especially Kenny dying though, it did get kind of old). But the satiric aspect of the series is indeed very important too, and you get a feeling that this is a clever show, it doesn't answer a lot but I think you do see things in a different light (while not being an enlightenment :)). As an example, I don't like Family Guy or American Dad because i feel like they are a little too pointless - all the time.Oh, and since it's cool to ridicule America here in Denmark, it's nice to have somebody to do it for you.Matt Stone And Trey Parker doesn't seem like they are liberals and conservatives, but pokes fun at the extremes in American society, and I think they have a very healthy view on America and the world.","10","26 August 2008"
"347","And if you get this title you've probably been paying to much attention to South park, like I have lately.South park is a pop culture Dynasty that really earned that sort of title even for it's first decade or so in existence. Said some great things, broke some important boundaries, made a lot of people laugh, and I'll always Love it for those reasons. But I fear Matt Stone and Trey Parker are flirting with less than irrelevancy by trying to keep the show in that realm, despite the mounted now s*** piling evidence that this is impossible.It's era of importance is long over. Like the Simpsons, it's still around as a bread and butter cash grab for comedy Central, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. It rightfully should have ended with its divorce from Isaac Hayes and certainly when the two creators stopped writing together.It's elitist attitude and coverage of irrelevant pop culture fads has passed being stale and has become rotten. As Book Of Mormon has proven they have the potential to create meaningful laughter outside of the confines of the show and I hope and pray that those two guys can get over themselves and can get over the ones brilliant phenomena they created.#LetSPDie and let it die with the little dignity it's got left.","3","30 May 2020"
"348","As much as I'd like South Park to be a short two or three season failure, I just don't think it's going to happen.  As long as it maintains its current cult-like following, it's not going anywhere.  I agree with all the other South Park-hating Simpsons-lovers out there, this show needs to grovel at the metaphorical feet of the Simpsons.  What I think it's doing is taking all the vulgarity, sex jokes, and swearing of, say, a whole season of the Simpsons and cramming it all into one episode.  Although I have nothing against some good raunchy humor and vulgar jokes (I love 80s teen sex comedies myself), trying to use it as the basis for a cartoon doesn't really work.  I think that South Park is, in fact, the sad product of a sad generation (I'm 14, so I suppose that is a little hypocritical), and that the Simpsons will always be the best.  HAIL SIMPSONS!!!",NA,"4 April 1999"
"349","I absolutely loved South Park when I was about 4 years younger than I am today. I still love it as much. But, in my opinion now, it's kind of going downhill, because all they are doing now is making fun of recent history, which in my opinion, is starting to get very old. When South Park first started, and when it amped up into it's 5th season, the episodes I thought were very brilliant, and normal. Most of them are hilarious, some have their disappointments, but most of it is very entertaining. When it first started, it was crappy animation, nothing but cheap cutouts of construction paper, but the gags were hysterical. But as the show gained popularity, and raised more money, the show was able to afford more advance animation. At least they kept the shows style the same, such as the eyes and expressions. During the eighth and tenth season, I got kind of disappointed, because they kept making episodes ripping off current events, which isn't wrong, but it is when you keep doing it. I liked it when Trey Parker and Matt Stone were making stories of their own, having to do nothing with events going on now. But now that's all they do, instead of just making up a story about an event they made up. They might have done it sometime around the eighth and tenth season, but I always see stuff on South Park the same as what I'm seeing on the news every week. But if your a true South Park fan, you might not care, which is fine with me. If you like it, then keeping doing so. But I recommend if you're buying the DVD sets for the show, buy all through season 5, I don't recommend 6 and through.","7","8 August 2007"
"350","South Park is the best thing ever to happen to animation! Really, I'm not lying. It is far superior to the Simpson's or the Family Guy. The Simpson's is funny yes, but in my experience the plots are tame. Yes, the Family Guy is funny also. The humor is very often insensible and pointless. If you want comedy from the big boys, then there is South Park.I will not even try to generalize the plot of South Park; it has been in play for far to long. Each episode is nearly always a story over itself per episode anyway. It is a story/comedy/commentary about current events in the United States of America. The twist being that it is saturated with liberal type philosophy. Any foreigners reading this? Psss, this show is an excellent portal into my great superpower dysfunctional hellfire nation. It is also very adult humor; the profanity in the show would fill volumes. But who cares about that? It is generally quite funny and nearly every episode comes with a moral lesson attached to it. If you are cool, you are already watching it. 10/10","9","29 June 2005"
"351","South Park is easily the best animated comedy I have ever seen, and one of my favorite shows of all time. It follows the adventures of Eric Cartman, Kyle Broflovski, Stan Marsh, and Kenny McCormick. Kyle (a Jewish kid with a strong moral center) is best friends with Stan (a relatively normal kid in the middle of his crazy town). They are joined by Eric Cartman (he's fat, hateful, widely disliked, and a bully AT BEST), their #1 frenemy, and Kenny (an impoverished, unfortunate child who is Eric's mistreated sidekick). The show follows their adventures in their quiet but crazy mountain town, South Park, Colorado.
The animation is supposed to be bad, but I've grown to like it over the years, although I somewhat prefer the very old animation style over the new one. Perhaps it's just the nostalgia though. The storyline and characters are amazing. I did a short overview of the 4 main boys earlier in this review, but there are many I didn't mention at all, and I mean MANY. Mr. Garrison (President Trump), Wendy, Heidi, Butters, the families of the kids, etc. THERE'S SO MANY. The story is pretty amazing. You don't have to start anywhere in the show, you can watch any random episode you want, unless it's in season 19, 20, and perhaps 21. Season 22 is more random, like the old seasons.
I've talked enough, GO WATCH THE SHOW! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!","10","10 January 2019"
"352","You old-school Simpsonites who are complaining about South Park should be ashamed of yourselves.  A one-joke show that relied on crude humor and annoying catchphrases to attract impressionable kids -- that's exactly what parents used to say about The Simpsons!  Being 16 and an avid 'toon viewer, I remember way back to when ""Eat my Shorts"" sent parents into fits. Remember?  It wasn't all that long ago.Yes, both The Simpsons and South Park are offensive on the surface -- razor-sharp wit is just like that (not that SP doesn't heap it on anyway). Unfortunately, a lot of people were/are so distracted by the ""offensiveness"" that they missed the brilliant writing!  South Park and The Simpsons are both excellent, creative, and realistic parodies, they're just different styles.  And I, for one, am glad that both shows had the guts to p*** people off in order to deliver great entertainment!",NA,"1 December 1999"
"353","Look, I love South Park.  I think it is one of the most original shows to come along in a long time.  However, let's get a couple of things straight.1) It is not, nor will it ever be, nor does it attempt to be The Simpsons. The Simpsons will likely have a legacy similar to that of the Flintstones in that it will be remembered long after those of us who grew up watching it have tuned it out (you know, like when we die).  South Park was never intended as a serious venture.  It was only contemplated as such after the original short had gained so much popularity.  Trey Parker describes himself primarily as a filmmaker (hence the speed with which the movie is being released)2) I don't understand why the vulgarity of South Park offends so many people.  The only reason I can think of is that kids are watching it.  I think the most telling point about the vulgarity was made in the Time Magazine article about the show.  A young child (around 10) was asked whether he was bothered by the vulgarity.  He responded by saying that nothing on the show was anything he hadn't heard his father say.  Vulgarity is all around us in movies, TV and radio (Howard Stern anyone?).3) Am I the only person who has noticed that the Simpsons really sucks this year?4) Name 5 sitcoms that are more original and entertaining that are currently on TV.5) By the way, Terence and Philip are not riffs on Beavis and Butthead. They are a response to TV critics who have clainmed that South Park is ""nothing but fart jokes"".However, for me, the bottom line is this.  I hate the show ""Touched by and Angel""  To me, it represents everything horrible about TV.  Yet, I am not about to go onto its web space here and decry its horriblenss.  I respect Trey and Matt for making a show based only on what they think is funny and if we like it, great.  If you don't like it, that's fine.  All I have to say is ""Screw you guys, I'm goin' home!""",NA,"4 April 1999"
"354","The show has gone so far into politics it isn't even done in good taste anymore it's like watching the news, or modern talk shows. It's just bad now, it's disgraceful that the creators of this show would turn such a wonderful, funny, entertaining, and satirical show and turn it into nothing but political mush. It's pathetic in its current state. I give it a 9/10 for it's overall grade but the current show is literally not even a 4 it's garbage. Don't watch past S18. It's literally just Trump jokes and slightly, and I mean slightly satirized current events it's essentially nothing but opinions at this point it isn't even funny.","9","29 July 2021"
"355","When the show ""South Park"" comes to some people's minds, they think toilet humor or mean-spirited jokes. When I saw this show back in 1998 I immediately fell in love with it, but I thought this series was all low-brow humor. A few years later, I realized that this show was much more than gross-out gags, but actually some of the wittiest humor on this side of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" or ""The Simpsons"". Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone are masters of low-brow humor; they don't go too overboard with the gross-out gags and while this humor can be ridiculously hard to attempt, they make it hilarious. The targets of this show are of wide range. Trey Parker and Matt Stone take no prisoners on certain issues(the media, pop culture, politics, and even religion). This series is also not as mean spirited as everyone says. If you look at it closely, it is done in a light-hearted way. The show does have a weakness, however, that it is topical. Even though it is topical, I personally think that it won't become too dated, especially with issues like censorship. Overall, this is one of the most brilliant satires that I have ever seen that seems to be very low-brow, but incredibly witty at the same time; it's a perfect balance. If you are into satire you will personally love this incredibly funny, sharply written series, that ranks right up there with ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" and The Simpsons"" as one of the best comedies I have ever seen.",NA,"19 July 2004"

I have only seen a handful of episodes, but have really enjoyed all that I have seen.  Cartman is irresistible.  This tub of lard is really funny.  How can you not love a kid who steals food from a starving ethiopian.  By the way, he makes an excellent cop, don't you think?  ""You will respect my A-thor-I-Ti!!"".

Its spin-off movie kicked ass and was as good as the Series(T&M's best film imho), The Simpsons never has and never will have a movie(EDIT:OK So I was wrong about that). SP's characters & story lines are non-linear, The boys have changed a lot since that first season, I always felt the simpsons should of moved on and the children grown up(me n bart were similar in age when the Simpsons first appeared on the Tracy Ullman show). SP has got better(generally) season on season(although s8 is better than s9) where the Simpsons has been on decline for years s16 & s17 for example are way below par s1-6. SP is cooler(hipness). Always has been always will be(The age of simpsons writers?). Both are musical shows, But the music from the Simpsons is great, where as the music from SP is better than super great(sublime even) think of The Chef aid album Vs Any of Simpsons albums(ulp just remembered TSSTB, bartman??! ne1 ¬_¬) or the film soundtrack with is outstanding(imho). OK I realise all of this and all the other stuff I haven't mentioned, will only provide a contemporary laymen's notion of better which as we should all know by now is subjective. But I'am fully aware of all the arguments for the Simpsons(like without it there would most likely wouldn't of been a SP as we know it) and could argue them almost as passionately but if I had to choose between the two for rest of eternities viewing I'd go for SP.My fave SP episodes are in no order: Scott Tenorman Must DIe 501(One of the funniest not to mention scary looks into the dark matter that is Cartman, with some hilarious moments such as When Radiohead read the plea letter supple 8yr old boy....Cancer!!....in his ass), The Simpsons already did it 608 This episode goes someway in clearing up this debate acknowledging the simpsons influence on SP but also points out that the Simpsons get a lot of there ideas from the twilight zone and every other family sitcom before and since. Christian Rock Hard 709 this episode is pure ""myrrh"" love it cos i'm a musician and cos its right on the money from start to finsh, and finally Season 8 eps 1 to 8 with the exception of Goobacks are beyond good. Too many of my all time fave TV shows are in this lot. good times with weapons 801 was the coolest SP yet, the style of animation changes(as in 608) to anime as the boys muck about as ninjas after buying authentic(sharp) ninja weapons. Up the down the steroid and Awesom-o making my S8 top 3 . Well i held the floor for a while now, I best retire and let you discuss this is you are so moved to do so. Adios Kobe",NA,"15 March 2006"
"374","South Park is running on Germany's RTL network for some weeks now and at first I was very eager to watch it because it got so much -and often good- press. But after having seen the show I don't think that it deserves so much attention. Maybe some of the jokes got lost in the German synch, but I don't find the kids funny at all and Chef's obsession with sex was only funny the first time. The only thing that is special about South Park is its unique, cheap-looking style of animation. Yet...the Simpsons had white -or rather yellow- trash style, Beavis and Butt-head had an attitude - South Park has nothing of both.",NA,"19 September 1999"
"375","I Like that cartoon. It's one of my favorite adult cartoons. But I don't think It would be sutable for people under twelve years of age because it cusses a lot and has a lot of adult diolog. Any way my favorite charactor is Kenny because he always has bad luck with his life. Poor Kenny always dies in this show. And he has a family that is ""poor"". Cartman always makes fun of Kenny being poor. Kenny hates it when he calls him poor. Mr Hanky the Christmas poo always makes me laugh because... uh well you don't want to know. It seems to me that Stan and Kyle are close friends together in the pack of four and Cartman seems to hate Kyle, Stan and Kenny. But he always hangs out with him any. My favorite Quote from Cartman is ""Screw you guys, I'm going home.""I hope South Park stays on the Air forever. Kick ass!","10","10 January 2003"

"377","Like The Simpsons, South Park is the best educational program the american TV has to offer. Many episodes are the product of insightful thinking. ""South Park"" has probably done more good to the american mind than most americans are aware of.",NA,"16 December 2003"
"378","Yes, ""South Park"" has survived all those negative reviews and comments from many people, including myself, but other than all that foul language and mature content (some people might not handle such content until they are old enough to live in a retirement home), there is the theme song. If I was to watch at least one part of it, it would be the opening sequence,because I like the theme song; it, like, spoofs the themes from ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", ""Petticoat Junction"", and ""Green Acres""! Currently, the theme sounds more like those themes than ever before, especially the ""Petticoat Junction"" theme. BTW, the first season recording sounds a little like it has a carillon in the background, a la ""Always Something There to Remind Me"". So, if you want to watch ""South Park"", unless you can tolerate mature content, don't watch the actual show itself, just the opening sequence.BTW, I personally didn't like the show at first, but after about a decade, it has grown on me. People my age come to appreciate the rude and crude adult humor that the team of Parker and Stone have come out with, and I've taken a good laugh from them. Older people (like my older relatives) wouldn't appreciate the stuff that ""South Park"" has to offer, and they make a good point. It's just that what is right for some people isn't right for others. But no matter what I thought of the show itself, before or after, disdain or just-for-laughs, this is one of the shows that always gives me something to laugh at when I feel like it.""Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!""","9","8 February 2003"
"379","Well, I agree with many of the reviewers I've seen. This show is, on the surface, incredibly stupid and full of dumb fart and sex jokes. But if you look a little bit closer, you can see strangely intelligent, and extremely humorous, ties to our own society. For example, there is one where people from the future come to South Park for work. Because they work at jobs that none of the South Park residents want to, and because they do it cheaply... well, you can probably guess what ends up happening, something that makes the residents furious. Can you spot the ties to current US issues? If not then you probably won't get it; but if you do you'll see and understand more than just the sex jokes.I originally watched only a little bit of South Park, and went, ""What a piece of garbage!"" and turned it off. I voiced my disgust to a friend of mine who is apparently a loyal South Park watcher, and they insisted that I see it through. And I did. And now I watch it all the time. It's really the sort of show that grows on you, and once you start watching you realize that the way they use the farting and sex jokes is really quite funny. But you do understand more than that. So don't just pass it off as a dumb show, watch it a couple times and see what you think.","9","3 June 2007"
"380","I dont write reviews usually but south park is One of the best comedies i have ever seen.
The satire can get tricky sometimes to understand but it eventually catches up with cutaways and references.","10","22 March 2020"
"381","South Park was a breath of fresh air for anyone with enough brain to look past its crude and disgusting surface, and read some of the messages behind its humour and sarcasm.The movie itself is the climax of all the angst filled, battered down, and hidden anger that exists against an entertainment industry that is too geared towards making the moral minority happy than providing true fun and humour for people who actually watch Television.The cartoons stars are full of cynical and sarcastic opinions completely devoid of any of the bulls**t that the TV Censors and uptight politicians that run our lives seem to be full of. The basic and unbelievably banal storylines are parodies of the moralistic themes that we are force fed day in and day out by other shows, such as day time drama, and cheesey after school specials.South Park is as real as a cartoon can get without being live action. It presents children as they really are, foul mouthed little b***ers... Parents are too concerned with their careers, or the lives of others to care for the family unit. The police and school system are totally incompetent and ignorant. It was the ultimate show, funny because it could be related too. Now, its lost its edge, becoming a mire of pop-culture ripoffs, and a satirical cynicism that has lost its attacking edge.Screw the series, Trey and Matt should work on another brilliant movie, and leave the series to die. By the way, if you think that South Park is nothing more than toilet humour and foul language, then you have missed the entire point, and probably too ignorant to have a properly informed opinion.",NA,"16 February 2000"
"382","Unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros in many of the situations.Now a lot of you who don't agree with me will argue that I hate it because its not politically correct or that it uses a lot swearing (etc.). But that's really not the case. It's more the fact that it has fallen into a rut of nothing but non-PC jokes. At times this causes the show to feel stale, forced, and a one-note show.A good example of a stale moment is the coffee moment in the recent ""Les Bos"" episode. The slowed down action is a parody of the movie 300, i get it. But it takes so long for her to get up and do a joke that in and of itself isn't too strong itself really bogs down the show.Also, its not the fact that they are using satire that turns me away from the show (I am a huge fan of Mr.Show, which does not have an episode without it), but more the fact that they hit it so hard every single episode. What they satire is actually very good, but it is presented so blatantly and with no subtlety that it loses all its charm with trying to make its message. Essentially, it's message is a good one, but they beat you over the head with it way to much.I guess the thing I really don't like about is not that its not PC or that it swears so much, its that its comedy isn't presented as well as it could be and its monotony of material wears thin after a while.Final Word: Comedy is stale and bludgeons you with its political incorrectness until you laugh. It's funny, just don't cram it down our throats.","3","13 April 2007"
"383","South Park is a hilarious show. It can be gross at times, but the show is brilliant. I'm surprised the show has last this long. I don't think this is the best animated show ever, because the best animated show with no doubt is The Simpsons. But this show is probably second. I'd give this show *** and a half out of ****.",NA,"8 March 2003"
"384","South Park is a great and funny show. It gets away with a lot of crazy stuff. But that is what makes it good. How the show makes fun of real life events and people is the best park about it the earlier seasons 1-10 are great.With seasons 11-19 still being great but not as good as the earlier ones Season 20-23 are the worst seasons but they are still good they are really weird but still funny and idk how they have made so many episodes and have not run out of ideas. The later seasons get away from random episodes and focuses on a whole story line","10","2 June 2020"
"385","South Park ranks amoung my top favorite TV shows ( along with Courage, the Cowardly Dog ). South Park is one very funny show. But poor Kenny officially dies *tear*. BRING BACK KENNY! Though Tweek is very funny.Like i said, South park is a funny, hillarious, downright awesome show!",NA,"15 July 2002"
"386","South Park is genius. It is irreverent, crude, foul, and brilliant. People talk about all of its political messages (which there are a great many of), but for me, the most important part of the show is how it reminds us how wonderful the ignorance of an eight-year old really is. The show is made up of various events surrounding four young boys living in a small town in Colorado. They constantly use foul language and speak of crude things, but ,for the most part, have no clue what there speaking about. Wasn't it wonderful when we were that age, and didn't have to worry about the deeper meaning of things. These four boys often go to extreme lengths to get something as simple as candy.Not only is the show meaningful, but it is flat out hilarious. I don't want to give away any jokes, but I can almost assure you that at least one joke will have you rolling on the floor.This is one of my favorite shows. A+!","10","17 October 2007"

Within the first 3 seconds of hearing the intro sung by Randy in the Mexican Joker episode,, I knew it was going to be terrible. And it was, just like the last 5 seasons. I didn't even watch the last 5 episodes of the previous season, now I will stop watching all toghether, I'm done. It's like seeing a loved one slowly being taken down by an illness. I will never watch an episode of SP ever again cause I want to keep the good memories intact. And dear God were they good back in the days.","5","1 October 2019"
"388","South Park is an amazing comedy show that never fails to make me laugh. Matt Stone and Trey Parker cover current events, social topics, politics, etc., while making it funny at the same time. The animation has greatly improved over time and, as of 2017, it's PERFECTION! 20 seasons and it still hasn't lost its humor that America fell in love with 20 years ago! Great show!",NA,"21 August 2017"
"389","It's a show that can stay current because each episode is made that week. It's satire is spot on and even though it has some material I find a bit offensive, it has material I can agree with as well. The crude humor is not for everyone, but it's a well made show. Long as you can take the jokes at face value, you can enjoy it. I don enjoy how the creators goes after everyone, without being afraid of offending anyone group, as they hit each group equally, rather than focusing on one side as most shows do. My personal favorite episodes are; Make love not Warcraft, Eek a penis, and Trapped in the Closet. A close 4th would be Cartoon Wars multi part. Good show, far from great, but worth watching. Not suitable for kids, which makes it that much better.","7","10 June 2017"
"390","This is one of my definite faves as i have seen each and every single episode at least once. seasons 1 and 2 were absolutely hilarious and can be recommended to everyone (old enough and open enough to handle it). then, as the third season rolled in, one could clearly notice the lack of ideas trey and matt seemed to have, some episodes turned out real classics nevertheless. it kinda dragged along up to season 6, which started to air this year and is in its break 'till june (if i'm not completely wrong).the episode with Osama BL totally p****d me off!!!!!!! i am NOT american and i'm not anti-american either but this was just more than i could handle since it was aired quite shortly after september 11th and the US attacks on afghanistan. it was tasteless (usually one of SP's most outstanding qualities) and if they tried to make some kind of political statement, then i didn't get it. another reviewer expressed his hate for the towelie-episode.... i have to agree: the episode truly sucked b***s and bored me. but introducing Towelie as a character was something i'm thankful for until this day (he reappears in ""professor chaos""/Season 6 and i LOVED the scene where he tries to play ""stairway to heaven"" but ultimately fails since he's far too stoned... as usual. it SO much reminded me of a few guys i used to hang around with... damn it reminds me of MYSELF! ;) ). let's not forget good old Mr. Hankey (the christmas poo) whom we've all come to love over the years.there are the ones who like nothing more than SP and there are the ones who detest it. the choice is up 2 you. but i will always respect this series most for its first 2 seasons... season 6 is notably going back to the roots of the series and i like it that way. let's just hope it stays like this and that trey & matt will know when the time has come to say ""it's over""."".....i have totally no idea what's goin' on...."" 8-)",NA,"29 April 2002"

We'll put something together while taking a dump,we get paid anyway.
I'm a fan since the start of Southpark and I always enjoyed the show but since season 21 it's going downhill.
The 5 episodes so far from season 23 are not humorous at all, the whole spinoff tegridy farms is cheap and shows the creators lost all inspiration to make something new again.
Please bring back the boys and make a story involving them, not Randy and his weed pfffff every episode (:

"393","South Park is an animated comedy series made by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Consisting of over 21 seasons, this show has become one of the most well-known and humorous shows ever. The average episode is about the lives of 4 fourth graders, that live in South Park, Colorado. The humor dark, little obnoxious, but still insanely hilarious. In the show, the attend South Park Elementary, where they have lots of other friends, such as: Craig, Tweek, Clyde, Butters, Jimmy and Token. The main characters have lots of adventures together. The four boys are different in many ways, like for example Kyle, Kyle has and still is the rational one, the boy who thinks with logic and is Jewish, though Eric Cartman, has a hatred towards people that are not in he's same religion, which makes him hate Kyle for being Jewish. Then there's Stan who is kinda the naive kid, but also pretty rational as well. And Kenny who's family is very poor and is often ridiculed for it by Eric Cartman. Kenny has, I think never, spoken normally, he for some reason prefers having an hoodie on, and speaking through the hoodie, making it muffled and hard to understand. And last, but certainly not least, there's Eric Cartman, who's often the one you think about, when you think of South Park, as a whole. Nonetheless he's always been the fat kid, even though he's in denial about it, and always neglects it by saying, that he's ""Big Boned."" Kids still ridicule him. His mom is a whore, but still is rational, caring and very sweet. She treats Cartman very badly, thus making him so mean spirited and fat. Cartman can easily control his mother by begging and crying to get what he wants. Eric Cartman is my personal favorite and I'm pretty sure a whole lot of people agree with me. All in all, South Park is incredibly funny and I definitely recommend it.","10","30 November 2017"
"394","I am a typical 15-year old kid. I am easily amused and basically anything can make me laugh. I like Beavis & Butthead and The Simpsons and King of the Hill, Family Guy, Futurama, etc... But South Park goes beyond these funny cartoons. South Park takes the risk that all dirty cartoons are afraid to go. I admit South Park is a 2-dimensional paper cut-out cartoon made by obviously 2 high school social rejects but it's funny. It's better than your gay Frasier or Seinfield, actually Seinfield is hilarious but anyway parents are always saying ""This show needs to be canceled, it's having a bad influence on my children."" Simple solution soccer mom don't let your kids watch it. A hard solution to such a HARD problem. So if there are any parents reading this: get over it, get a life and if you don't like your kids watching it then don't let them. Problem solved.",NA,"26 April 2000"
"395","While the show's best year hands down was it's first one, and while South Park lost a big chunk of it's veiwers, I still tune in. Nope, I'm not the fart-an-ass joke fetishist, but most of the time people just can't see the ingenious undertones among the stupidity.'While it's jokes are getting staler as we speak, the writers still try to get a point through, with out being modest the least bit.The best moment of the year, I think, was the ridicule of the KKK. It was so silly and dumb (they have a game called ""Who's wearing the silliest thing under their robe"" and a cake raffle at the klan meetings!), yet it seemed so right because the KKK sucks and deserves it.South Park's jokes may grow repetitive. They may have promoted the heck out of it. But if you can't take it, then don't watch, get over it, and, to quote Cartmen, ""Quit your bitching"".",NA,"3 June 2001"
"396","Most of the people who criticize this show, do so because they are either prudes or dont get it. As for the animation being bad, isnt that kind of the joke as well?? Some of these episodes are comic masterpieces not just for their gross out qualities but also for their social satire. ""Death camp of tolerance"", ""Fat Camp"" and ""Timmy 2000"" are absolutely biting in their lampooning of Americana. The writers on this show are dead on in their ridiculing of many aspects of American culture and the tons of obscure references to movies or Tv shows (Star Trek) are well done. Easily one of the best shows on TV.",NA,"11 February 2004"

"398","Ok it's a funny show but you have to not take yourself seriously to watch this and not hold any strong values. Otherwise you will be disappointed. The creators provide their own personal bias on issues through comedy and it can be very polarising.","7","14 October 2018"
"399","I cannot understand as many others have already stated that this fantastic programme full of intelligence is persistently mocked. Yes it does have obscene language yet it also does give warning that it is directed for an adult audience. It's like watching American Pie but in cartoon version and moaning that it is too crude. However for myself to say I have been watching South Park since I was 7 years old (Now almost 18) and I'm still watching it like there's no tomorrow. In fact I've become to obsessed I want to emulate my own version (obviously slightly different). My favourite character is Kenny and always has been he absolutely rocks, I thank Trey and Matt for bringing him back as he's the greatest and without him it would suck. Overall rating, 10.

I wanna thank Trey Parker&Matt Stone for this. It's something completely different and that's really what we want to see. But at least i'm able to listen to its songs and they are also great!! Thank God for South Park.",NA,"30 May 2000"
"401","*BEWARE, SPOILERS AHEAD*Who says cartoons are for children? Not anymore! If you thought the Simpsons were more of an adult show, think again.And let's face it, how many people haven't heard of South Park yet? If it's not on your TV right now, you may have come across the name on the news or in a newspaper - for it does contain some foul language. And references to sex. Lots of 'em. Oh and did I mention violence? All the things a kid's show shouldn't have.So what is South Park? It's a small mountain town in Colorado. It's about Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and their parents, pets, neighbours, friends and foes... and their crazy adventures. And it's about making fun of a entire army of celebrities whose voices are (according to the makers of the show) imitated... poorly. But a big Hurrah! and a bone-crushing hug to Matt Stone and Trey Parker for bringing the show to our screens. The DVDs do not contain any extras (though you may enjoy the short introduction at the beginning of each episode - so far I have only season one on DVD so I'm not sure about the rest) which is a bit sad, for I would have greatly enjoyed a little look-behind-the-scenes.One of the best features of the series is Kenny's death. It kind of resembles the Simpson's couch gag, and you simply won't grow tired of it. My favourite so far was when the space station MIR crashed on to Earth and simply landed on top of poor little Kenny. Err splash? Matt and Trey, rock on!",NA,"26 August 2005"
"402","True, I agree South Park can be crude, but the cursing andtoilet humor is just the first layer. There are some genuinelyfunny moments that make me laugh out loud, such as thesemi-classic ""Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut"" cliffhanger, where,after Kenny is frozen to death Stan says to Kyle, ""Dude! Do youthink if we hit him with a shovel, he'd shatter?!"" And Cartman's voice is a riot. Just the way he goes "" 'ey!"" whenhe's p***ed off is hilarious. The cursing can be gratuitous, but somehow it's part of theappeal of the show. Love it or hate it, it's there to watch, andwill be for a while",NA,"28 November 2000"
"403","And that is, that this show is hilarious. Every new season brings new surprises and adventures. The show manages to stay funny even after 7 seasons. Normally, shows would begin to go stale and the jokes become old and unfunny. (the Simpsons) The reason why South Park is not like the others is mainly because of it's use of current events to make episodes. This show is extremely funny and you are missing out on a truly comedic masterpiece is you don't see it. And, apparently, the 8th season premiere will be something to look forward to. It will do something that South Park never did before. The only way to find out for sure, is to stay tuned.I give South Park a 10/10.","10","1 March 2004"
"404","This show is probably my number one favorite of all time, This show goes really in depth with the struggles that happen in our world.

This show is 100x better than family guy and the simpsons.","10","19 November 2021"
"405","South Park is probably the most misunderstood show in TV history.Sure, it does have fart jokes but what it has really involved into is a show that depicts a wide range of current events, pop cultures references, social problems through the lenses of a group of 10 year olds and all the wacky characters that surround them.The fact that the drawings are fairly simple also makes a lot of people shy away from it, but actually this show has a completely unique approach to several divisive or thought-provoking subjects. To name a few:'The Hobbit"" looks at how photoshopped photos makes society expectations of a woman's body hard to reach and the amount of pressure it may put on little girls (whilst taking hilarious jabs at Kanye West and Kim Kardashian)
""You're getting old"" takes you over the nightmare that is feeling like you might be mentally older than you friends and that may make left out
Console Wars episodes dive into the consumerism involving Black Friday, video games and the world's obsession with Game of Thrones
These are all great episodes and I think the show if anything has aged well with time.The other brilliant thing about South Park is that because each episode gets produced in the span of week, it can be more up to date than any scripted show - just this season it referenced Kavanaugh nomination controversy in an episode even before he was eventually confirmed.Second 10/10 I have given on IMDb and South Park is well deserving of it.","10","28 June 2020"
"406","Many of my friends at my high school watch south park and think that it's the funniest thing on t.v . I myself have watched it numerous times and think that while it can on occasion be quite entertaining it is often disgusting, offensive, and simply awful. Now many of you are probably saying now ""lighten up its a animated TV show, all the jokes probably go over your head thats why you don't like it"" ERRRRRRRRR WRONG! One of the few episodes I enjoyed was ""Make Love, not Warcraft"" having wasted a year of my life to that game I found it simply hilarious and frightfully accurate about how it takes control of your life. However, on the other hand the episodes about the passion of the Christ, the one where Cartmen gets a inheritance and buys a amusement park, and the n-word one are simply disgraceful as are many others but these are just some extreme examples. The one about that passion of the Christ simply bashes religious beliefs, is strongly anti-semitic (for those idiots who are like ""what does that mean"" its a word for being discriminatory towards Jews), and does not accurately portray what happens in the film or what the message the film tries to convey. The episode where Cartmen buys the amusement park I found almost as offensive. First, its wasn't funny.... Second, when Stan (I don't remember if it was kyle or Stan) gets a ulcer or tumor or something on him and hes in the hospital dying and his parents read him a story from the bible about a guy who was extremely devoted to god and the devil bet god that if god cursed the man that he would no longer believe in/be devoted to god. God did this and took away all this guys wealth and killed his family etc. but the man stayed devoted. In south park this is where the story ends and Stan or kyle is like ""OMG thats so awful"" or something to that extent and renounces his belief in god. The thing is that while most of the story is actually in the bible they decided to cut out the end...after seeing that this man was so devoted to him God blessed him 10 times over, making him the richest man in the country, making him powerful, giving him a beautiful wife and many kids etc. , I'm so goddamn sick of people trashing religion like that. Then the kicker, the episode which basically just involves saying the N-word 2,000 times over 30 minutes. Now, I'm not African-American but I found this episode simply revolting so that after around halfway through it I switched off my t.v and vowed never to watch South Park again. If you guys want to watch real comedy and satire watch The Daily Show or the Colbert Report. Or if you are into animated stuff then check out family guy, which is even funnier and much less offensive.","1","30 September 2007"
"407","This show is stupid and yet it keeps you rolling with laughter. There were episodes where there were meaningful messages like in the episode titled ""The Super Best Friends"". It is a funny show with funny lines and a constant talkitive pain-in-the-butt 8-year-old Cartman, who suprisingly went on the list of vh1's 200 greatest pop culture icons. Funny show and a must see for those who need a good laugh. Check your local listings.",NA,"25 September 2003"
"408","South park caters to both intellectuals and the sheep alike. The in your face comedy is top tier, and 99.9% of the time is incredibly original. Their are countless lines that get stuck in your head for years, and for the direct comedy alone the show is a contemporary classic.However, the dark comedic elements, undertone, political messages, and plots of the episodes are basically the best you can get in a show. Matt and Trey are ruthless to the satirized people/cultures portrayed in the show and sometimes the parodies reflect their actual opinions.This show is a must watch for anyone but kids under the age of 12 and soulless religious fanatics.","10","29 November 2011"

He's willing to believe anything, like in the episode where Cartman built the bomb shelter.I also like Twong Lu Kim, the guy who works at City Wok; he's really funny, and so is Nobunaga Hiroichi.Maybe I'm wrong here, but  did they make the joke in the movie that Saddam Hussein did his own voice? The Liza Minelli joke is really funny, and his high voice is great!Does anyone know what exactly Kenny said in the first two seasons? I read in the trivia it was really crude, but it's hard to understand.P.S. If you guys don't know who Nobunaga Hiroichi is, wait for my next message.South Park rules!",NA,"25 January 2004"
"410","People often get the wrong impression with South Park. They see it as an immature show that relies on the lowest common denomenator to be funny. To an extent when it burst on to the scene that was true. Killing Kenny every episode was contorversial, as was the swearing that came with it. This was what got people's attention and sadly deflected away from the rest of the program. However with time the writers have got better, and now produced much better quality episodes, which still cause controversy, but do so in different ways, and have done away with the lowest common denomenator which attracted the average viewer. This leaves us with the most intelligent comedy show on TV as another user pointed out, and I'm impartial because I love most shows. The other cartoon comedys are not to the same standard in their writing, as though we all love Family Guy, its completely random and may well be written by manatee like South Park pointed out. The Simpsons is past it too, they were right about running out of material, they should end it before viewing figures end it, as re-runs are becoming more enjoyable than the show, and this leaves South Park out in front. Every episode now makes a point and makes you think. A lot of my view points now come from South Park, may it be about Spoilt American teenagers, the evils of Wal Mart or Paris Hilton. Have I really written this much? I'm off to watch South Park on AllSp.com!","10","14 January 2007"

This show has jokes that anyone can get if listening properly. This show may not be The Simpsons but It's just as good. And It's amazing that a small number of people can cover a large amount of Character voices. Celebrity stabs are visible but when the creators demean him or her they do it good!South Park will not be moved from our TV Screens. The Show will be around for at least another 3-5 Years.

"414","Sure, the show can sometimes have dark humor and disturbing themes, as well as disgusting things, but this is a funny and wonderful show nevertheless.

"415","Previously a ""10"" until Season 24, Episode 01; New South Park - Brilliantly clever, covering every possible argument, EXCEPT a running gag that Trump secretly wants the Pandemic to continue, in order to ""kill as many Mexicans??"" Not even clever or funny. South Park has gone overboard, being ""harsh"" on Trump the last 3-4 seasons, which is fine, BUT without any balanced ""satire"" against the Left! Parker & Stone may be geniuses, but are also tremendously ""OCD Mental"" about Trump.","5","1 October 2020"
"416","I honestly can't figure out why two zany exploitives known as Trey Parker and Matt Stone and a zany cast including the late Mary Kay Bergman (who did voice-over work for several animated Disney projects), the late Isaac Hayes (a legendary blues singer who contributed to the ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" and ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" soundtracks) and April Stewart (who provides English voice-overs for several Japanese anime video games) got together and created this sloppy-looking animated sitcom that obviously looks like it satirizes ""The Simpsons"". To my knowledge, this was the first thing that Parker & Stone created as a team, and after seeing some of the episodes, I'd say it's for a very good reason.The animation is actually pretty good in places considering the circumstances and the fact that this show is made really, really on the cheap. However, like I said, it is really cheapo, with sloppy cardboard characters, sloppy backgrounds and lazy-looking objects. (Comedian Will Sasso once joked that Parker & Stone are always in such a huge rush that the print on screen is still wet from the lab.) Most of the episodes also have a tendency to be really slow, like 3-5 frames per second where most of ""The Simpsons"" episodes are 24. Therefore the movement looks a lot less fluid, almost slide-show like.As for the episodes' story lines and theme concepts themselves, it fits well with the lack of technical razzle-dazzle by providing equally underwhelming stories. As with most animated sitcoms, there's basically two stories going on at once, but the episodes are so short that nothing really comes out of the stories. There's a two-part story arc where Eric Cartman (the most annoying character on the show, obviously the biggest reason for this show's failure) gets tossed into an imaginary world, itself a thinly disguised ""Spirited Away"", an episode about film festivals in which the hosts want noise to be bought upon the town, several holiday specials all involving a relatively disgusting figure known as ""Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo"" (seriously, what happened to Santa Claus?), and another two- part story arc where everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) overreacts to a ""Family Guy"" episode with Muhammed Ali in it. All the episodes have no meaning to them and only exist as filler, as well as insults to the stuff portrayed within, including Broadway, Tom Hanks, Kate Beckinsale, etc. As for the rest that are offended, this show simply manages to get away with it, with no one to sue this show whatsoever.To sum up, most people will be disgusted at the animation and styles that they don't even want to believe it exists. Thus, this show is bound to wind up getting canceled --- and another sad reminder as to why Comedy Central is on the rocks.","1","19 June 2012"
"417","I think the earlier seasons of the show were better. Now they are trying to hard to touch on all the major political issues which we are already beat over the head with all day every day. Those older episodes that weren't serialized that focused on the not so serious topics like black Friday, or the release of the ps4 and xbox one, or blockbuster etc etc... those were just better.I don't really find the show offensive or outside the box. It's just like OK been beat over the head with this highly politicized topic enough, and the show doesn't really bring anything new or interesting to the table. And on top of that they've been focusing on basically a single topic for entire seasons. So if you are bored with it then there's really nothing for you for the rest of the season. At least in the past all the episodes were different, so if you weren't interested one week, you might still enjoy the next week's episode.","5","14 September 2017"

How many times has that poor kid kicked the bucket....hey I lost count a long time ago.That Canadian duo, Terence and Phillip rock. They just love to FART!!! They are just plain rude and very funny. I have been watching South Park right from the start. I never miss an episode. Good thing that it is going to be around for a while. Could a cartoon be any ruder, sicker or funnier.....probably. But it will never be as good as South Park.",NA,"14 February 2001"
"423","South Park was created by Trey Park and Matt Stone. Both Stone and Parker are still to this day highly involved in the making of each episode, often writing and directing most of the episodes, something very rare in television(animation or otherwise). They also perform a majority of the voice-overs for the male characters, often using pitch-shift technology in order to do the voices of the child characters. The first episode was actually made almost entirely construction paper- cutout stop motion animation. But from the second episode onwards, they switched to computer animation. By the fourth season, the technology and production had advanced to where they could write, produce, and animate an entire episode within a week. By season 5(my personal favorite season), they had become the quintessential satirical television show. In addition to the fast production cycle, the creators had a fearless ambition to write about hot topic events, sensitive issues, and other aspects of society deemed too taboo for television. Whether it be an episode that addressed post-9/11 America and U.S. military activity in Afghanistan a mere 2 months after 9/11(""Osama Bin Laden Has Farty Pants"" by personal favorite episode), an episode that aired one day after the '08 election that predicted Obama would win, and predicted both Democrats and Republican's (over)reactions towards it(""About Last Night...""), numerous episodes about the controversy over cartoon depictions of Muhammed(some of which resulted in death threats towards the South Park crew), or episodes that simultaneously slammed PC Culture and Trump- esque xenophobia(most of Season 19, most notably ""Where My Country Gone""), no topic or ideology is free from slander. But it's not just current events that make South Park so amazing. Some of their better episodes have involved more low-key, sitcom-based plots, which the creators sometimes call ""kids being kids"", or ""Peanuts-esque"" episodes. In addition to clever and humorous writing, these become successful due to the great characters that inhibit South Park. The series mostly revolves around four 4th grade boys: Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Kenny McCormick and Eric Cartman. Stan and Kyle are the main protagonists of the series, and often act as the voice of reason amidst all the chaos that consumes South Park. Stan and Kyle are based on series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone respectively. While both Stan and Kyle have similar personalities, they differ in other ways. Stan(my favorite character in the show) has had numerous episodes devoted to his occasional spells of depression, and Kyle's Jewish heritage and rivalry with Cartman are long running hallmarks of the series. Kenny, while most famous for his numerous deaths and reincarnation throughout, as well as his near inability to speak without mumbling due to him almost always wearing his iconic orange parka, with the hood pulled to tight over his face, has in recent seasons become one of the more complex characters in the series. In recent seasons he has occasionally become his superhero alter-ego Mysterion to save the day. He also often uses his immortality(which he only knows about, as later episodes have explained everyone but Kenny forget his numerous deaths ever happened) to sacrifice himself in order to save his friends and family. His sex obsession, occasional drug use, and family's lack of money are also key characteristics Kenny's had since the beginning. Cartman(only his mom calls him Eric), despite sometimes being considered a ""friend"" by the others, and constantly hangs out with them, is openly hated by almost everyone in town, and rightfully so. Cartman's key characteristics include his shrewd deception, greed, racism, and is generally described as a borderline sociopath, and his schemes have intentionally caused the deaths of numerous one- time characters(most infamously in ""Scott Tenorman Must Die""). South Park also has excellent secondary characters, who occasionally steal the spotlight. This includes but is not limited to: Butters, a friend of the main boys, whose innocence and naiveness often gets him in trouble, and makes him a perfect victim and/or right-hand man for Cartman's schemes. Wendy, Stan's girlfriend, who is often a very outspoken and politically active(for a 4th grader) feminist, and often acts as another voice of reason. She also has a rivalry with Cartman, who often insults her and her liberal viewpoints. Tweek, the boys overly-caffenated, paranoid, but well-meaning and likable friend. Randy, Stan's humorous father, who often acts irrationally(especially when drunk) over trite situations, and usually gets caught up in South Park residents near constant mob mentality, often as the mob's leader. Mr.Garrison, the boys teacher for most of the series, who is actually very mentally unstable, and often has the same racist, and xenophobic ideologies as Cartman.While I've tried my best to describe what makes South Park the best, the only way to find out is to actually watch it. I never thought I'd consider myself a South Park fan, but about 2 years ago I gave it a shot, and it's become my favorite show ever. It's even helped shape me as a person. There are numerous life lessons and philosophical teachings scattered throughout almost all their episodes. And that's what makes South Park special and enjoyable, for me at least. There's a healthy mix of heart and humor that not a lot of people expect, but South Park has handled topics such as depression, grief, isolation, the value of love and friendship, and other emotional and personal topics so perfectly, that sometimes I almost end up crying because the episodes are just so beautiful, heartfelt, and amazing. As of writing this, South Park just finished up it's 19th season a month ago, and it's still going strong. Hopefully it'll go on forever, because I know it'll still be good in it's 40th season if it ever reaches it, that's how amazing Trey Parker and Matt Stone are. And that's why in my opinion, South Park is television's greatest achievement.","10","18 January 2016"
"424","Ever since I started watching 'South Park' when I was about 9 years old, I have loved it so very much. Yes, I know it is kind of messed up to start watching a show like this as such a young age, but I do not seem to have bared any damage whatsoever.Anyways. I know plenty of people, especially old folks, who would rather commit suicide than watching this show. Though, I am certain I know more than ten times that amount of people who love it from the bottom of their hearts - including my girlfriend and I. I can understand that it is too much profanity for some people, though, since this show goes further than any other with its humor.What I personally /love/ about this show is the fact that most if not all episodes carry subliminal messages. Some of those messages are about politics whereas others are about suicidal thoughts. The more you watch it, the more you will understand what I mean. This proves that 'South Park' is, in fact, not a show for simple-minded rednecks, but much rather it is meant to be viewed by an intellectual audience.This show, with all its profanity, has bestowed me with plenty of joyful years filled with laughter, and believe it or not: I am /going/ to make my children watch this once they turn approximately 12 years old. It is simply too great to not be shared with friends as well as family!","10","13 May 2014"
"425","""What the...FAT ALBERT DOESN'T SWEAR!""That's what I was telling myself watching the episode ""Clubhouses"". Obviously they can't think up any new, funny jokes for parodies, so they take away that character's personality to make them a lifeless, humorless, soulless ""South Park"" character.  And the Fantasia ""spoof"" in Mr. Hankey returns""?  UGH!!!!  I don't call ""making all the sewage rise up"" funny. Maybe pre-schoolers would, but I doubt this is for pre-schoolers, now, am I right?And gimme a break with Kenny's deaths all the time!  ""Oh my God, you killed Kenny"" is SO old.  Yes, I know he didn't die in the first season's Christmas episode, but I say, SO THE HELL WHAT.  The point is, he dies in every episode.  This show's only joke, used up in the first episode, and before that in that ""Spirit of Christmas"".Other stuff like that ""Chef Aid"" CD and that ""South Park"" Nintendo 64 game are nothing but useless, boring, inept pieces of propaganda that will only be bought by the lunatic fans of this show, who refuse to say, ""It just sucks.""  Trey and Matt no longer care about the show, they let fortune and fame go to their heads, and now, your hard-earned cash is the only thing important to them.Plus, this show was only on for a year before they said, ""Let's do a South Park movie!""  I've read the plot outline, and it doesn't sound too promising.  It was about three years before a Beavis and Butt-head movie was made, and it was cool.  What Comedy Central is doing is going too fast. Plus, I've heard a plot similar to it...it sounds like they ripped off an episode of ""The Simpsons.""  (A show I'd MUCH rather watch.)Speaking of which, you South Park freaks who say South Park wipes out The Simpsons and Beavis and Butt-head need to realize the next thing I'm about to say.All you South Park freaks need to give Beavis and Butt-head some credit and/or respect.  If the order of shows went ""Simpsons, Ren and Stimpy, South Park,"" you probably would not BE watching South Park today because you'd watch it and think it sucks.  Why?  Well, a few people called it ""Peanuts on acid.""  I call it, ""A wannabe Simpsons trying to be Ren and Stimpy.""As well, Beavis and Butt-head became popular because they are one thing: ORIGINAL.  South Park is, well, a rip-off of The Simpsons in several ways. Try putting Simpsons characters in South Park situations and it'd turn out the same way.(ie.  Homer Simpson for Chef, Marge Simpson for Mrs. Cartman, Bart for Stan, Milhouse for Kyle, Nelson for Cartman, Martin for Kenny, Lisa for Wendy, Chief Wiggum for Officer Barbrady, Seymour Skinner for Mr. Garrison, Maggie for Ike, etc.)Trey and Matt, no one is going to be watching this forever.  After that movie, please kill the show.  (You'll probably have to.)  After the second season, I see no more humor or life in this show.  It's hopeless.",NA,"12 March 1999"

"427","I loved the first 18 seasons of this show very much and would have rated those with 9s or 10s without any hesitation.
But since the last couple of seasons, this show just isn't funny or even original anymore. The PC principal stuff is not funny and I don't get who this tries to target. The carman's girl friend stuff is even less funny but was dragged over many, many episodes that did not trigger one single laugh. And now this Tegridy Farm stuff?! What's that? I don't get it.
The show now feels like being done by some completely different people as it lost all of its funniness and does not have any good idea anymore. And I can't really understand this, as The Fractured But Whole (game) was hillarious and felt like having the older seasons ""soul"", indicating that the creators are still able to do funny stuff, but decide to don't do funny stuff in the actual show and rather choose some boring political stuff.As a true old hard-core fan of this show, I am very, very disappointed with this development.","5","7 December 2019"
"428","This show started off great but as it got in to it's third season, it just stopped being funny.  There's only so many times swear words and tasteless storylines can be entertaining.

"429","Yes. I believe this truelly is the finest Animated show ever. It is consistently funny, morally acute and down to earth in the most far out way possible. I refuse to miss a single episode, and am always surprised that Trey Parker continues to produce some of the most thought provoking, intelligent stuff on the mind control box. When South Park is on top form it can deliver a powerful message with the simple facial expression of a minor character. Given the depth of most of the central characters, it's always fun to get an insite into one of the lesser known ones, allowing characters like Butters to become as indespensible as the rest.

Think about, man, I seriously don't like South Park. Another reason I gave South Park a 4 out of 10 is because it's humor is a little dry and inmature. Who the hell finds a kid getting killed in an accident funny? Plus, if people think South Park is art, then where have you been. South Park is not art, it's just as trashy as Jerry Springer or other sleazy, disgusting, crude, offensive crap on television that people are warped by.","4","17 June 2006"
"436","On my list of all-time comedies, South Park is in second, behind Family Guy and before the Simpsons (this is of all comedies, not just cartoons.  That the top three happen to be cartoons is quite interesting...).  I know I've just mortally offended 90% of the people reading this, but hear me out. The Simpsons was the greatest comedy of its time.  Its perfect blend of physical humor, political satire, and social commentary defined its genre in the 90s. But the 90s are over, and the Simpsons have died.  They are a pathetic shell of their formal selves, and now South Park has taken up the torch they dropped.South Park is too often defined by its use of foul language and vile sight gags.  But those who do so are blinded by their ignorance and fail to see the true heart of the show.  For South Park has taken political and social satire and turned it up a notch.  They are able to take the hottest topics of the day and rip them apart while leaving you gasping for breath from all the laughter.  The creators are unafraid to tackle any issue, and their unique form of production allows them to respond to recent events in a very timely manner.  Take for example their 9/11 episode that aired in November of 2001.  Despite the seriousness of the subject, they were able to make fun of the situation without belittling it, and were recognized for it with an Emmy nomination.  I think the main point of the show is they are able to tell society, ""you know, you're taking yourselves too seriously again. You need to just back up, have a laugh at yourself and move on.""  It's very refreshing.Of course, the show would be nothing without Cartman.  There's nothing like a foul-mouthed, racist, greedy, selfish, fat little eight year old boy whose voice you wish you could imitate better.  Move over Homer.  Your replacement's here.",NA,"20 September 2003"

One of my best friends suggested South Park to me because it made her laugh like it made me laugh. We would watch it together every time it was on on TV. I would recommend it to anyone who loves comedy and a laugh. Even my son agrees that South Park is one of the best ever created shows. He is 19 and has literally stolen all my South Park discs. I probably would have done the same if i were him because i have loved it for so long that i just understand that one of the best ways to make comedy is by making fun of people, in the most kindest way but it normally ends up different.

"439","I got into South Park last year, and I didn't know what I was getting into when I saw the first episode. I will say this plain and simple; South Park is one of the smartest shows on television right now. I suggest it to everyone who likes Family Guy, The Simpsons, Team America (made by the same guys, by the way) rolled into one. Matt Stone and Trey Parker have created a masterpiece. South Park is the story of 4 boys, Stan Marsh (the almost-regular boy who has a crush on pretty girl Wendy Testaburger), Kyle Broflofski (Stan's best friend, who is sometimes picked on for being Jewish), Eric Cartman (the fat racist mean boy who for some reason is able to be slightly befriended by the other three), and Kenny McKormick (the poor kid who always wears a hoody, so you can't see his face, also he dies in every episode). The show consists of the gang going on a bunch of misadventures that range from being chased down by a 200-ft mechanical Barbara Streisand to shooting terrorists with Jesus. Bottom Line: South Park is smart, funny, stupid, and spine-tingling. The show is on at about 7 on Comedy Central. WARNING: not suitable for kids under about 13.","10","26 January 2007"

It's not TV trash: they often introduce serious deep moral and political questions managing to present those issues in a non-boring and even hysterically fun way.Their ability to in every episode surprise everybody with a new unimaginable hilarious situation and/or a new caricature (let it be of a famous person, about the behaviour of just about any character [even walk-ons and ""normal"" people] or the catch phrases of Eric Cartman) that makes everybody remember something they have witnessed but they couldn't ever imagine so much parodied!And sure by mixing that with curses and goofy violent killings the result is irresistible laughter.It couldn't get any better: 10/10",NA,"30 January 2003"

"443","My favourite show at the min, but unfortunately the retards over in the UK refuse to show it often enough. The show is simple...4 kids and a town full of nut-jobs. The humour is consistently funny and blows every other show which thinks there being controversial out of the water. They touch upon subjects which are risky but often the best episodes are those which are risky...someone give Matt and trey an Oscar",NA,"1 July 2003"

"445","South Park is a comedy(If it can be called that) for people who have no sense of humour at all. It gets its laughs purely threw crude language and sick story lines.Kids would find it funny because of the bad language as kids don't know the meaning of funny, but for adults to like it I would seriously question them. There is no intellect at all in this programme and Family Guy is a complete class above this.I would not recommend this at all to anyone who hasn't seen this. Would be a waste of 20 minutes. The rating of South Park on IMDb does not reflect the programme at all.","1","21 April 2011"
"446","Stone and Parker are quite intelligent people, but even they make mistakes. And where others would try to hide that fact, they shove it in our faces. I was always a big fan of the series, but from early on I oftentimes wasn't on board with points the creators made. Too capitalist, too conservative, and, their biggest mistake in my view, not taking climate change seriously.But the Manbearpig story - which is a metaphor for climate change, which they at first seemingly denied - showed one thing clear: That they are capable of openly apologizing and accepting when they were wrong.The thing is: You don't need to be 100 percent on board with their political views to enjoy this show. I saw some Trumpsters on here claiming South Park has gone ""PC"" - why? Because they made Mister Garrison into Trump and are ridiculing him heavily? So it's okay if they ridicule EVERYBODY but when it comes to your Messiah suddenly you're angry and scream ""PC""? I feel like they were very generous towards Mister Trump. And they ridiculed the Political Correctness movement more than once. But well.Sure, there's plenty of toilet humor. If you don't like that, maybe South Park isn't for you. I for one was quite sad when they banned Mister Hankey from South Park for talking bad on Twitter about the townspeople.If you're offended easily then this show isn't for you either. You should be able to take a joke - or two - because South Park will most likely have ridiculed your political view, religion or whatever as well. I'm for example an agnostic, even we get made into a joke and the episode ridiculing agnostics is hilarious.","10","13 January 2021"
"447","Let me tell you, the producers of South Park made that dumb show because they knew about all of the morons out there who laugh when they hear ""ass"" and ""lesbian"". People, get real, South Park is a highly offensive, very unintelligent, very very unfunny, and very gay show that only entertains 5 year olds or people with an IQ less than 90.Don't EVER mention South Park with The Simpsons.

"450","South Park is one of my favorite shows to watch, it makes me laugh and it makes me happy. I'll be honest there's plenty of episodes that I do not like but there's more of them I do. The newest season is really good and keeps a storyline which is different from the others. If you haven't seen South Park before I would definitely do so if you aren't offended easily. It's great at showing plenty of emotions like in the Episode 'Chef goes Nanners' Wendy and Cartman show to have feelings for each other. But in the next episode Cartman hates Wendy and doesn't want her to be in their band. I could use more examples but I don't want to write too much. Please check out the show as I think you'll enjoy it!","9","14 March 2017"
"451","South Park is a crappy little cartoon that could, and did. The animation is terrible but for some reason it's so appealing. Each character is equally unique and equally hilarious. Especially Cartman. In my personal opinion one of the funniest cartoon characters of all time. Cartman is so mean and spiteful and hates to lose. When ever he gets worked up the outcome is hilarious. He screams and swears and curses his friends for his mistakes. His character has never changed even after all the episodes. The cartoon is vulgar and disgusting but this is all one could expect and all I really hope for. South Park has been around for seven years and I hope it will go on for another seven.","10","5 April 2004"
"452","I love South Park. They rip on everybody.I watched it as a kid and still watch it today. I actually learn more from it than news that lean liberal or conservative.

"453","It's sad, reading negative reviews. They seem to either say, ""If you want political commentary, watch the news,"" or ""Fart jokes aren't funny. Let me classify these two people. 1. The first person doesn't like facing facts, hard decisions, or the real world. To them, television is an escape from their somber reality. Buddy, what makes South Park great is that it downplays serious issues and makes them funny. Also, person 1 probably disagrees with the shows politics.2. I hate person number two. This person watches maybe one or two episodes and makes the choice of liking or disliking. This pisses me off, because I've given the Simpsons for years after they sucked, giving them chances to turn around. If you think this show is nothing but fart jokes, then please don't post here or watch the show again.On to my review: There is a certain...thing to South Park. It makes it so good that it can get away with pissing you off, yet still be funny. It's also the most accurate portrayal of how kids really act that I've ever seen.It's wide range of humor almost always hits, and it's commentary usually is even minded.9.5/10",NA,"15 November 2004"

"456","Ladies and gentlemen, in one year Comedy Central saw a juggernaut come out of their Wednesday and Saturday 10 PM time spots and in a short time in fell into the crater it made when it hit.  As much as I don't want to say it (despite the fact that I still watch it) South Park's popularity has now been centered around the collegiate and working people.  I can say this because I'm 15, and I believe it to be true.But I admit, South Park has been losing popularity ever since the summer when Matt Stone and Trey Parker pulled the old switcheroo on April Fools. When the second season started up (finally), it regained some popularity, but now the show seems fatally weak, and I imagine 9 out of 10 viewers would say the same.They would also probably say that South Park is better than the 10 year old Simpsons who still have some spark in their quest to now be the longest running program in history.  South Park is better in many ways:1.  The mercandising has been ""off the hook"" since the first three shows, and while sales are still giving Matt and Trey something to smile about, the Simpsons merchandise hasn't been noticed for a while.2.  It's a surprise that in 10 years the Simpsons don't have a movie, and as of this moment (December 8, 1998) Matt and Trey are filming away at what should be an ""all-out slobberknocker"" of a movie for South Park fans.  South Park: The Movie is due out sometime in Spring '99.3.  No Simpsons CD was as highly touted as the new Chef Aid CD that came out on Thanksgiving.  With such great artists as Ozzy Osbourne, Old Dirty Bastard (or Big Baby Jesus, whichever), DMX, Crystal Method, Master P, Puff Daddy, Lil' Kim, Mase, Wyclef John, Elton John, Meat Loaf and Devo, Chef Aid blows any and all Simpsons CDs out of the water.And contrary to what some skeptics may think, as long as South Park gets 10% of the viewing audience on Wednesdays and Saturdays from 10 PM to 10:30 PM, they're still going.",NA,"8 December 1998"
"457","So many dismiss South Park as a vulgar adult cartoon, laced with foul language and offensive jokes. I won't deny those, although the compliment the show's appeal for the teenage age group. But, what matters is the edginess and sharp satire of every episode that makes this show a classic.Matt and Trey are fearless when it comes to who they attack with their razor-sharp satire, their aim ranging from Al Gore to Mexicans, homosexuality to Paris Hilton and all that's in between. The potty-mouthed fourth graders we've come to love have the wackiest misadventures that always parody or satire with wit and wisdom.","10","25 March 2008"
"458","When South Park came out in 97' my mother locked it out of our Television. It was two years later that I was finally able to watch what everyone was talking about. Come to say I waited two years to long; I hated it. The episode I watched was very slow and stupid, I didn't even laugh once. So basically that was the end of that, I had not intentions of ever watching South Park again.Then this summer (2001) there was nothing on, so I turned to Comedy Central (the good old standby). When I saw South Park on I was ready to go to bed early, but I started watching it. Then I started laughing, and enjoying the antics of these fourth graders. I've watched South Park ever since. True the show may be very crude, rude, perverted, and all around sick but you have to remember it's and ""ADULT"" cartoon for those with that type of humor. So if you're up for some major potty humor, and the many deaths of Kenny. Then catch South Park, even if it is just for a cheap laugh.",NA,"5 August 2001"
"459","I have been watching this show since the first episode. In fact, I had seen ""The Spirt of Christmas"" a year before the first episode came out.  Apart from the usual fart, fat, and Jew jokes, ""South Park"" happens to be one of the smartest commentaries on our culture.  Unfortunately, it takes a bit of delving to get to that commentary and so there are many people who see this show as just childish jokes and crude humor. The past two seasons have been nothing less than inspired. The episode where Kenny dies couched a serious discussion about stem cell research in a show where Cartman leads all of Congress in a rousing verse of ""Heat of the Moment"" by Asia.  ""Jared Has Aides"" is all in an elaborate plot to say that AIDS is now funny because enough time has passed-whether Matt and Trey truly believe this is unclear. But watching people celebrating in Times Square is wonderful. To those who feel that that the Butters episode was too unsubtle, it was _meant_ to be that way.  The yelling at OJ, the Ramseys, and Condit was in no way supposed to be hidden. This was Matt and Trey commented on the fact that these people all got away with murder no matter what any court said. As for the comparision to the Simpsons: yes ""South Park"" could never have existed without the Simpsons. However, the Simpsons has not done any serious social commentary in years and even their basic plots are getting dumber and dumber and highly unfunny. Matt Greoning has given all his efforts to the unappreciated ""Futurama"".  As I say about ""Family Guy"", appreciate ""South Park"" for what it is and you'll be fine. I am looking forward to many more years of foul-mouthed, potty humor that just might make us all say ""You know, I've learned something today"".",NA,"2 May 2002"

Also, despite the crude animation, and the fact that only a couple guys are doing the voices, the show has likeable characters, each with separate personalities. It also follows the tradition of such shows as Married with Children, Night Stand, and Get a life, by never showing an episode that isn't funny.",NA,"19 December 2001"
"468","This show is the most retarded piece of crap! And yes I have watched it before. The jokes just aren't funny, and if you do think they're funny, then just go to any high school, or even junior high. Those are the only kind of jokes you'll hear! I hate the animation it's like bad paper dolls. People have said that cartoons aren't just for kids, and they're right but this cartoon isn't funny. It's just the same stupid joke after another. I friend of mine said that there was severe political issues talked about in the show. If that's what you want to watch then turn on the freaking news!

I just could never watch this without wanting to peel my skin off with a rusty spoon.",NA,"1 May 2004"
"469","I've certainly seen South Park scenes that made me cringe and wonder if the childish or outright profane references are necessary. I don't think Parker and Stone write perfect humour, and occasionally they step over the line without positive effect.For the most part, though, the profanity is an integral part of the show's message. Sure, it might attract some viewers who simply enjoy the sheer grossness of the dialogue, but it also serves some important purposes. The profanity creates a context in which the other themes of the show are portrayed from a different standpoint than those taken by mainstream media (whether it be a simplification, division, criticism or a representation of multiple views on the issue). Many episodes combine a foul or ""immature"" theme with a popular current issue, setting up both plot lines as ridiculous. In the same vein, it mocks the common standard that everyday behaviour like violence, profane language, sexuality and even normal body functions are off-limits for display on television, and in doing so prepares the viewer for uncomfortable subjects.I don't think a cartoon that simply poked fun at the headline issues would do as well. It takes some additional creativity, and sometimes shock, to really draw in an audience, and South Park does it quite well.","8","8 March 2008"

It gets old with time and it becomes tiring and exhausting and the ridiculousness of it...(which is what makes it so effective in its satire and comedy)...becomes a weighti honestly can't believe it did more than 8 seasons.

I've been watching the show since the first episode, and I still can't believe some of the crazy stuff they come up with.  Lemmiwinks, Mr. Slave, and the Lil' Crime Stoppers's first case (granny killed by husband with a hammer) are some of the best moments of the series, for shock factor.While I understand that this show is not for everyone, If you allow yourself to realize it is just a cartoon, in no way real, then you would enjoy the show.Congrats to Trey and Matt, and I hope South Park makes as long a run as the Simpsons.",NA,"1 July 2003"

"473","Since this has been stated hundreds of times before, I will be quick with this. South Park truly is brilliant satire. It has some of the best critiques of todays society on TV. For instance, in one episode involving the Church using Hell as a scare tactic to get people to come to church, one of the children asks if crippled people go to hell because they can't confess their sins. The nun who was asked has no answer. When she goes to ask the preacher, Kyle(the jew) bursts in and asks if Jews go to hell. The preachers response goes something like this: ""The bible says that all children will stand before God and be judged...unless they're filthy Jews who go straight to Hell!!!!!"" The show constantly attacks politically correct morons, religion(much as I do), and everything else from fat camps to child molestation.

"477","Matt and Trey are probably the greatest satirists in modern TV history. Their real genius is demonstrated in their ability to be both generally conservative and counter-cultural at the same time.South Park is really appreciated by right-leaning libertarians, since we don't have much else in the mainstream media (other than maybe John Stossel and Penn & Teller). Some people complain that Parker and Stone don't go after Pres Bush that much. Well, that's because they are above that. They're on a whole other level. And to be honest, it's refreshing.Politics aside, the comedy is pure gold. The show intelligently uses comedic timing and shockingly abrasive content. It also purposely employs the use of children, which helps get their messages through, and uses a crude animation style which enables Parker and Stone to tackle very current and topical subject matter. They can supposedly get a show out within a week or two of a news story breaking.","10","22 June 2007"
"478","I have just gotten into watching South Park. I in fact used to hate it but when I sat down and actually WATCHED some of the shows I realized how clever it actually is. When you look past the toilet humour, the cursing, even the so called bad animation you get a cleverly written very funny show that challenges the limits of television broadcasting.This show does not promote intolerance towards anyone (with the exception of Barbara Streisand);) rather it makes fun of the stupidity of people who are intolerant as well as society's over compensation towards these issues.
Some examples of these issues are in the episodes 'Cartman's Silly Hate Crime' where Cartman is sent to jail for throwing a rock at Token because it was considered a hate crime just because Token is black, 'Death Camp of Tolerance' where the children complain to their parents that Mr. Garrison, who is trying to get fired so he can sue the school, is acting too gay and are sent to tolerance camp, 'Chef Goes Nanners' Chef complains that South Park's flag is racist, when the children hold a debate on the issue, they completely miss the point of WHY it is racist and 'Child Abduction is not Funny' where all the parents freak out about child abduction and begin getting suspicious of everybody and eventually suspicious of themselves. There are of course many other very funny episodesThis is a very well written, well thought out show. It is NOT intended for children or people with no sense of humour. I give this show 9 out of 10.",NA,"30 April 2003"
"479","The reason this show is funny is because it's bold, and doesn't care who it offends. Since it offends every racial group and both sexes nobody is left out. The shock value for it will send you into fits of laughter, but beware, if you are really touchy about language and sexual jokes, this show will most likely make you mad. By the way, this show is for more mature viewers. Kids (people under 17) shouldn't watch it.",NA,"18 December 1999"
"480","South park presents a simple premise: ""Everyone will laugh, everyone will be offended. No one is off limits."" Seemingly, the show delivers on all fronts. The comedy is unrelenting, with hilarious voice acting. The gross out humor is abundant. Yet, when the last component of the premise falls flat. Many episodes suffer from forced and painfully biased satire, which can make some episodes very unpleasant to watch. In truth, some ideologies and political parties are picked on far more often, while some are not mocked at all (Note: to maintain political neutrality, I will not name the show's biases). That said, the show is undeniably funny, and the animation style and voice acting is charming. Not a terrible show, but certainly far from perfect.","7","5 June 2015"
"481","I became aware of ""South Park"" by seeing an commercial for the N64 Computer-Game, as the Show itself is completely unknown in my country. It appeared strange, and out of curiosity I went out and bought the DVD containing the first four episodes named ""Cartman gets an anal probe"" ""Volcano"" ""Weight Gain 4000"" ""Big gay Al´s big gay boat ride"".I was impressed.The show is drawn very simple, everything is ´flat´ and 2-Dimensional and has this ´painted by a small child´ look. Animationwise, it reminded me of the 1982 Czech Animation feature ""Krabat""(D: Karel Zeman), although ´SP´ is much more colourful. As a contrast to the innocent, childish look of the show, there is the crude and brutal way the people of South Park, (especially the four main characters) treat (and talk to) each other.The dialogues and the storys are funny, and give political statements, as any satire should.The Show is about the main characters Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny, four 8-Year old kids. they live in in the tiny town of South Park, Colorado, a strange place full of deranged people(does it exist ?).Stan is somewhat the leader of the pack, a good quarterback who´s major weakness is his throwing up when his girlfriend Wendy talks to him.Kyle is a jewish kid, and Stan´s best friend. He has a baby brother who he uses as a football.Cartman is called ´fat-ass´ by the others who don´t seem to respect him much. He´s so fat because he get´s stuffed by his mother. He has the dirtiest mouth and is the star of the show.Kenny is a little strange. He can´t talk because his mouth is covered by his overall. The other kids appear to understand his mumbling, though. Kenny dies in every episode I´ve seen.Other series regulars include CHEF(Isaac Hayes is brilliant), the cook of South Park elementary, their teacher, a lunatic who talks to his handpuppet ´Mr. Hat´, and the publicity-hungry mayor McDaniels.I loved the characters and the show. In my opinion you can´t compare it to other cartoons out there, not because it´s better, but simply because it´s different.I rate it 8 out of 10.",NA,"30 March 1999"

This show actually touches more real life issues than you might think. It just happens to exploit them for all they're worth. This is the greatest show ever because it actually dares to go beyond the boundary and actually deals with something that people can relate to.

It started out as a delightfully vulgar series of well-disguised morality plays, with a variety of humor that gave everyone something to laugh about in just about every episode. If you liked it because it was raunchy, you were consistently satisfied and if you were looking for smart humor, you could enjoy it, too. Though I'm not exactly sure when this show fell into a black pit of stupidity and never recovered, the moment when I personally lost interest was ""A Million Little Fibers"". The show was at its best when the four principal characters were vehicles for the jokes. When they decided to do an entire episode about Towelie, run his only funny catch phrase into the ground in the first 5 minutes, and include a sub-plot about talking genitalia, I knew the intelligence was gone from this show. I've seen a few episodes that came after it, and current fans rave about (such as ""Imaginationland""), but remain unimpressed. South Park gets high marks from me because the first seven seasons are, with little exception, enjoyable. The decline of the show since then all but eliminates that goodness, though, and I do not recommend that anyone watch South Park in its current state.","6","17 April 2010"
"486","Yeah, most people are right. The old South Park episodes were genius and brilliantly hilarious (chinpokomon and cartman's anal probe), but the new ones lack as much social satire and shoot more for shock. Kenny is finally dead. but now that he is gone, the show has lost some of its edge. Every show dies (except for simpsons) and I guess this one had to as well. SO long South Park, if you fellas don't make some serious change, I really think the show will be canceled in 2-4 more seasons and then what will comedy central do for profit?? (they certainly arent gonna run SNL all day)",NA,"14 June 2002"
"487","South Park is the greatest cartoon and one of the greatest comedies ever made. Matt Stone and Trey Parker's bold attack on political correctness was and still is exceptionally courageous but at all times delivered with great humour. Episodes usually consist of current events,references to popular culture, parodies and critiques of public figures, a look at ridiculous social phenomenon such as metrosexuality,racial stereotypes, a humorous but unoffensive look at religion, the odd sexual reference or act and attacks on any group or individual who is intolerant of other people's opinions. All and all a groundbreaking comedy.","10","22 October 2007"
"488","With our lives, we have been designed with purpose and the ability to achieve that purpose through goals and achievement. Our focus with our purpose should be on others first and then ourselves. In this TV series of South Park, you see anything but purpose. Four Kids - Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny - go around in their town of South Park with meaningless lives. They criticize everybody and everything, they do things for their own benefit, and half the time, they don't even like each other. This series portrays a very individualistic model that is seen in our culture today. I have even watched episodes and have seen the purposeless life, always wondering why they do things. Why have a purpose in our lives, when we can do whatever we want to do and not care? South Park is the best example of living life with no purpose and not achieving the potential that you have. It becomes all about self. God created us with a special design and purpose and the will to achieve that purpose, but it comes to the choice of the person. If we follow the South Park model, we will find ourselves wondering around aimlessly in our world, doing whatever the trend sets. However, if we follow the idea that we were created with a purpose and can will ourselves to achieve it, we will find ultimate happiness and satisfaction. Our purpose is simply to serve God and others around us, which goes against the individualistic mindset of South Park. Why live aimlessly for ourselves, when we can live ultimately for God and others?","1","2 May 2012"
"489","When I saw people talking about South Park I always hear them talking about the same thing '' South Park is much cool is both dirty word''Because I am a person who likes series with intellect, I tried to stay away from South Park, until when I saw South Park, for seasons 7-8 I realized how wrong those people wereSouth Park is not just an offensive humor and meaningless, is a critical of acidic society and the world, is an intelligent humor, and offensive, that you do not see the South Park is cool simply because of their language real, like people really think and talk on the day-to-day, think about South Park as one of the greatest inventions of mankind, where the target of the criticism is simply the worldIf you do not like to see South Park because you feel ''offended'' I'm really sorry for you","9","30 June 2013"
"490","The first time I saw an episode of this show I hated it more than anything! I thought it was the biggest train wreck I've ever seen but then I gave it another chance and started from the beginning. I absolutely loved and adored it! It was funny, random, f*cked up, cruel and with a perfect amount of political satire. It was perfect until season seven, then it just became lame, it tried to much and it was just plain boring. But I sat through every episode until season 12, then I just couldn't do it anymore! Every episode was complete torture. If I only had to grade the six first season I would give it 10/10 but now I can only give it 4/10. And then I'm being nice!","7","6 November 2011"
"491","This is probably one of the funniest series I have ever seen, and I just can't wait for the movie to come out.  As I say, this series is both good and bad.  My four favorite characters are Stan and Kyle, the friendliest of the four scamps, and Chef and Mrs. Cartman, probably the two most notable adults in the series.  Two of the characters I can't tolerate at all are Stan's sister, Shelly, and Eric Cartman.  Shelly just gets in the way and is an annoying addition to the series, and Cartman is totally annoying by voice and dialogue.  I give this series a nine out of ten rating.",NA,"3 April 1999"
"492","obviously it's one of the funniest shows on television...and'the best thing about it is how it gets under the skin of all the repressed people who want to censor it. The fact that the conservatives are on a warpath to censor material just shows that they are illiberal by nature - they do not believe in freedom and democracy, or the open exchange of information and ideas. We can't have a free society if you don't have the freedom to read the books, watch the movies and TV shows, and listen to the music that you want to. Closed societies respond to the expression of ideas with censorship and repression, because the governments in these societies are not confident of their legitimacy, that is why they must resort to repression of dissent.","10","6 April 2008"
"493","There is no better show than South Park on TV. People have clearly judged it by its early years, when Trey and Matt mainly did fart jokes, which I still found hilarious, but they have blossomed since those years. They have taken the show in many new directions, from their early years of youngster oriented comedy, to the satirical look on the Western world,to integrating their own love of musicals into the show, with their constantly hilarious songs they write themselves, to proving great points on the American goings on, such as the Scientology episode, as well as giving us all life lessons in an EXTREMELY comedic way, such as the episode where Randy Marsh becomes an alcoholic. South Park is great, I've been an avid watcher since it first started, and am now considering a career as a writer thanks to in large part to this show and it's creators. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, I will say again, are comic geniuses, with some great voice over work, despite the disclaimer at the start of every show which says voices are impersonated...poorly.They do great work, from Stans dads voice, to Mr Garrison, right on to Dr Mephesto, the voices just work so well. For anybody who fancies comedy, this show has it all and more, so give it a watch. I can't think of enough good things to say about this creative masterpiece.","10","22 August 2006"
"494","Above and beyond any other adult cartoon on TV. Reruns are on the local Fox affiliate here on Saturday nights for hours and hours and I think it actually gets better ratings than SNL reruns. The show is just so brilliant and well structured. Occasionally there are episodes that aren't as good as others, but the boys continue to make great product. It seems like just yesterday the movie came out, and I still watch it and enjoy it when it's on. I think my favorite part of the series is the episodes in which Randy, Stan's dad, is asked about anything science related and although he is just a geologist, he is expected to know/help the situation.","10","9 June 2008"
"495","This show is probably the funniest and most on-point on it's satirical comments. Sometimes they stretches the line so far that you just sit back and wonder how on earth they came up with this idea. The political comments are also smart, especially in season 6 and 7. I'm not american so I don't even notice the cursing, and don't understand how people get offended by words they have heard a million times before.Favourite episodes : 101-104-105-110-213-215-401-404-406-408-410-501-503-511-512-514-602-607-608- 612-613-614-615-616-702-704-705",NA,"20 April 2003"
"496","If you haven't already seen South Park, rush out and buy the videos NOW, but I do have to warn you, they can be a touch...what's the word...offensive. It all depends on your sense of humour, as long as your a little...sick, you'll love it. It's not just the humour, but it's the characters as well, they all go into this great programme. LOVE IT",NA,"27 September 1998"
"497","The early days of South Park were so random and funny. That has changed and became a political cartoon making fun of political errors. Whilst not as great it's still funny and follows a way better storyline now.","7","14 August 2018"
"498","I just started watching this show again after a several year break from it, and it's still as funny, if not funnier than before. Matt and Trey have this way of taking anything from politics to pop-culture and crafting a bizarre story that garners lots of laughs. Sure, there are those who will be offended by some of the content, but I think it must be emphasized that a lot of Matt and Trey should not be taken seriously at all. It is a cartoon after all, not a political statement. Of course, you should be able to figure that out after seeing Eric Cartman use stem-cells to make his own pizza restaurant, or two disables kids join ""The Crips"".",NA,"24 September 2004"

"501","I first became a South Park fan 4 years ago.As soon as I finished watching my first episode, one thought ran through my mind: Holy sh1t. This show still makes me laugh to this day!The characters are very funny. I really begin to wonder at the beginning of every episode: how will Kenny die tonight? Oh, and Cartman deserves a kick in the a**.The list of interesting things would continue but it would take too long.My personal favorite episodes: It Hits The Fan, Wacko Jacko, Professor Chaos, Mr. Hankey's Christmas Special, and The Shove Food Up You A** and You'll Crap out of your mouth episode (I forgot the name).Bottom lime: see this show! It's on Wednesday at 9:30 and 10:00 P.M. on Comedy Central",NA,"18 July 2004"
"502","I used to be a HUGE south park fan as a kid and teen. By the time I was in my early 20's, I started to realize that this show isn't really that good as its ""fans"" make it be.For a show that tries too hard to be ""mature"" animated show, it relies on a lot of immature jokes that just appeal to juveniles. Fecal humor, cussing, sexual and racially insensitive jokes are what middle schoolers enjoy, not full grown men. I don't understand why not just the fans, but tv critics praise this show. In my opinion, this show has singlehandedly ruined adult animation. Because of its success, every other adult cartoon tries to copy its humor and fail miserably.Adult animation doesn't have to be about vulgar humor, it can be focused on serious or actual mature content. Think about it, they can be like dramadies (drama+comedy, like How I Met Your Mother), horror/thriller (Black Mirror), crime shows (Law and Order, CSI), or even in settings about the gloomy aspects of life (This Is Us). Even better it could be on historical , sci-fi, or fantasy settings in an epic scale (Game of Thrones, Vikings, Star Trek, The Gilded Age). Shows that actually focus on the human condition and make stories based on the human mind and heart.South Park focuses on the crude and ugly aspect of humanity, were teenagers dominate comedy and gatekeep on what is considered funny.","1","23 March 2022"
"503","South park traces the adventures of 4 elementary school kids and the people around them. Stan, the most 'normal' boy of the four, has loving parents and a sister who bullies him all the time. Kyle is the intelligent one but it isn't surprising since it runs in his family. Kenny is poor and dies in several episodes only to be resurrected after that without fail. cartman is the obnoxious spoilt anti-hippies kid who is used to get everything he wants. These four kids always find themselves embroiled in a sticky situation, sometimes those that are so serious that they concern the whole world, but always get out of them unscathed (except maybe kenny). south park is filled with humour that gets very offensive, but i've to admit they are generally funny. it makes references to almost everything from religion, latest hypes, politics and various famous characters and exaggerates on them so much that it's amusing. Some episodes does not seem to have any message to convey, yet they're still fun to watch, cheap animations aside.",NA,"16 May 2004"
"504","This show is magnificent and is in my opinion probably the most fun show to watch and every episode is so creative made with the perfect voice actors, all the voice actors match the characters and i love how the show is made and the animation of the show kinda gives it a 2D vibe, i feel like there's episodes of everything and, you can learn about gen z from it and all the new trends and poltic news.","10","13 September 2021"
"505","It's the coolest show ever....that's right, better than the Simpsons. It's South Park and it's the most genius idea ever thought of. I mean, who hasn't seen it? And the better question is, who hasn't loved it at the same time? South Park is great in every way. From the smut jokes to the vulgar cursing, it's great. In fact there isn't one person in my house that hasn't laughed at South Park at one point. (Who couldn't like the Michael Jackson parody?)Everyone I know loves South Park and fans are growing by the second. So if you haven't seen it, I suggest you start sitting in front of the TV for hours......or at least until it comes on. You have a lot of catching up to do. And if you don't like it, then maybe you shouldn't be here. And if you do, then thank you, you have made this the best show ever!So for starters, this show is about four 8-year-old boys, Stan Marsh, Eric Cartman, Kenny McCormick, and Kyle Broflovski. They are all some of many of the strange, dysfunctional residents of the redneck mountain town of South Park, Colorado. Along with some other great background characters such as the coffee-addicted Tweek, Stan's ex-girlfriend Wendy, Mr. Hankey the Christmas poo, and Chef, South Park is one awesome show.",NA,"1 February 2005"
"506","first of all, i don't know if anyone noticed but, the message posted by nickL-3 said that ""south park is the most stupidest show"" which is grammatically incorrect. South park is a very funny show that uses some times ""crude"" humor to make fun of current events, people and more. Some of their humor is very witty and if you arent smart enough or know enough current events to understand the humor then laugh at the interesting voices, funny characters,celebrity impressions and clever antics then just follow along as best you can.",NA,"16 February 2004"

"508","Never before and never again will we have a show that's attempt to reach as far into the comedic stratosphere as possible be as successful as South Park.Time and time again this show has proven that crossing the line is ironically acceptable if all the right elements are combined together to make excellent satire, hence why the show has lived on for so long.On multiple rewatches I have found this show to be seemingly never-ending in its richness an depth. Upon each reviewing there is always some new interpretation to a story arc or a nuance that I haven't noticed before.Another important part of this TV masterpiece is that it never takes it self seriously and routinely denies any attempt at doing so. Whether this be from the media, or from winning an award (the episode where they made fun of their Emmy). Or even from the creators own egos.This devotion to keeping things simple is why the shows comedic excellence will only be understood by those who've given the time to it, who have looked past the front cover of fart jokes and bad language and seen that it's a whole other world more than that.Few other TV programmes have had such well tuned social commentary that's managed to stay neutral in its mission to shed light on social and political issues like South Park has.To surmise, If there's one thing that South Park will be remembered for throughout the ages it will be it's silly uniqueness that couldn't really be emulated the same way again.","10","5 December 2021"

"512","South Park is not only good. South Park is in my opinion the best show ever. South Park don't know rules and that's a good thing. They make over everybody jokes. The jokes are not only funny, much of them are good social criticism.","10","11 January 2022"
"513","South Park's one of the best American shows in a long long time. Just like The Simpsons, this is one of my favourite comedy series ever. Cartman is simply the meanest human been ever; he compiles everything that's bad. Stan and Kyle are the average smart kids and Towelie is the regular hash-stoned towel.Unfortunately, it's very unlikely that most people will understand it. Most pseudo-intellectuals will bash it; false moralists too. But I can see that, in ten years, when the show is no longer aired, it'll be classified as ""cult"" and the very same people who once criticized it are gonna love it.",NA,"8 May 2002"

But what could be funnier than 4 foul-mouthed 8yr old in a small town in Colorado? My favorite character is Stanley. He is really funny and smart. My favorite episode is probably ""Towelie"". It was hilarious! I also liked the episodes ""The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers"", and ""Cripple Fight"". They were funny too. South Park is not for everyone though... (Mainly young children and adults). It's definitely made for mostly a teenager audience. But if you find dark and crude humor funny, then you'll love this show!

"517","South Park , now in its 10th season has established itself as one of the funniest animated shows ever created.Trey Parker and Matt Stone ( creators of South Park) are comical geniuses . The show mocks everything from religion to the American government.All the characters are well developed and brilliantly voiced. ( From closet homosexual : Mr. Garrison to the fat smart mouth : Eric Cartman ).South Park ( like a good wine ) gets better with age and I personally hope the show goes on for a few more seasons.","10","3 July 2006"
"518","You bet it does.This show is the only one that I watch religiously, never missing an episode, even if its one I have already seen. I think it is so funny, and it stands the test of time. I can watch it over and over and find new things funnier every time.Eric Cartman is the most hilarious character on television. You can take Joey Tribianni and shove him up your butt. No one else can get away with the things Cartman says, and he also has one of the most memorable and imitatable voices I've ever heard. The show is so crude and vulgar at times - but that it what makes it even funnier. Watching this show is one of the only times I've ever actually cried because I was laughing so hard, and my stomach hurt for a while after because I had been laughing for such a long period of time.I have a word of advice for anyone who says this show isn't funny, it's overhyped, and whatever: just watch the show. Most of the people who bash this show have only seen snipits, or have seen an episode about an issue they might not agree with. If you watch one of the funniest episodes, like ""Death Camp of Tolerance"" (my favorite) or ""Fat Butt and Pancake Head"" or any other one: you'll get hooked.

"520","I must say that even just a year ago I couldn't stand watching South Park. I had never taken the time to really sit down and watch it once I was old enough to understand. I saw pieces when with my uncles on holidays and never understood the ""funny"" element of the show. This year however I started being friends with a different group of people. My new friends aren't as stuck up and they watched the show all the time. They all found the show very funny, which I thought was odd since we liked the same sort of shows and movies. So I sat down one night and watched the first episode, and by the end of the night I had watched the whole first season. South Park was better than I ever could have dreamed. I loved watching Kenny die over and over again. Seeing Stan puke on Wendy even when they were dating. Watching as Kyle went against his mother. Seeing Kyle and Stan the ""super best friends"" and wondering if there's more to that than there seems to be. Having Cartman follow Kyle around the US, all so Kyle will suck his balls. So much has happened and it leaves me wanting more. I can never seem to wait for the next episode wondering if anything new will happen between the boys. No matter if it's just another crazy adventure or some relationship (my favorite ship at the moment is Kyle/Cartman; I just watched imagination land.) Maybe there is a lot going on in the show but you have to love it. Yes there is language. Yes there is violence. Yes they make fun of religion. Yes they make fun of race. South Park makes fun of just about everything you can think of. The point is they make fun of it ALL. They don't just make fun of one race or religion. The show is funny and everything that could be viewed as bad just adds a little bit more to it. South Park is what it is. It's just plain funny, no matter what anyone says... it's amazing!","9","19 July 2008"

"523","I love SP, and I don't get upset easy. But the latest episode, ""Best Friends Forever"" (which hasn't aired here in Sweden by the way), is in my opinion a bit provocative since Terri Schiavo just passed away (the same day it aired in the US?). Trey and Matt didn't know that when they wrote it of course, but anyway. Maybe it was just a coincidence. Being Swedish, I don't know how long this has been a debate in the US.SP is of course a satire, and you should be able to make fun of euthanasia just like anything else. Especially since it reflects the division between a conservative and a more pragmatic view of life among people, a classic SP-topic.But whatever your opinion on removing life-support to Mrs. Schiavo may be, shouldn't the family be left alone to grieve before anyone make jokes about the situation? I know the joke isn't directed to her or her relatives, but you know...just for the sake of politeness and decency? I mean, radio stations were not allowed to play certain songs after 9/11 (no other comparisons made) which was understandable. Views anyone?",NA,"31 March 2005"
"524","South Park usually tries to push the limits on animation and always succeeds with its charming paper cut style, gross-out moments and gore and always keeps fans coming back for more. South Park was considered a fad in 1997 when it started with the episode ""Cartman Gets A Anal Probe"" where cartman is convinced the has been abductted by aliens and tries to prove it, and was called crude by many people and critcs alike however it was the highest rated program on comedy central. With many people requesting comedy central to watch South Park on their TVs the ratings increased and kids were even banned from having South Park T-Shirts in schools. i prefer having this shock humor burned in my mind rather than hearing practiclally farts for 30 minutes, because it actually tells you how much society messes up, like the over censorship of TV or how many stupid internet memes so all in all this show is practically the news only funnier and more entertaining.","9","19 June 2014"
"525","It is sad that there are people that watched 2-3 episodes of South Park on TV and they probably think what is this childish crap.Well they cant be more wrong. South Park is one of the smartest TV shows ever. It is true that the last 2 seasons are not so great but every real fan who watched all the episodes will enjoy them too. Character development is so amazing in the show if you are watching from the beginning. Everything always seems stupid and unrelated but that is what makes it funny. Every episode actually ends with 2 or 3 messages that you can take from them. You will laugh at the very stupid stuff but you will end up loving the show for more reasons then just that. Watch the first season and you will not regret it! Cheers","10","2 March 2015"

There's a story in the news now about a catholic watchdog league shutting down the episode about the bleeding virgin Mary. if you haven't seen the show, it's probably the most irreverent yet, and i can totally see how it would be offensive to catholics. that doesn't mean i agree with it being yanked from the schedule, and now that same watchdog group is trying to get the episode completely struck from the archives and not be put on the season 9 DVD. what they don't realize is the second every South Park is done airing, there are a thousand little hacker kids transferring the DV to their computers and uploading it to a file sharing network. completely banning the episode from future viewing will create more of a buzz around it and have everybody downloading the notorious ""banned south park episode"". oh well, we'll see what happens.long live South Park!",NA,"5 January 2006"

"530","This show is by far one of the funniest on TV. It is clever, funny and not afraid to be very inapropriate. To those who say the animation is awful, yeah it is! It's not supposed to be from pixar or disney. If you are offended by it, then DON'T WATCH IT AND QUIT COMPLAINING! It's that simple. The new characters have been great, especially Timmy, Jimmy and Butters. Every show slides after time? It's only getting better with age!",NA,"27 December 2002"
"531","South Park is a love it or hate it kind of thing. If you have the first 4 seasons and like it, then you probably don't even need to read this to know it's a must buy. Two words, cripple fight!!!! This season was even better than the previous four.This season has the first appearance of Jimy, the other handicapped kid on the show (Timmmy being the first). Personalities collide and we see probably the most un PC fight in the history of television. The only episode that is funnier than cripple fight is the Lord of the Rings spoof but that's not til season 6 or 7. if you don't like political satire or aren't sure if this is up your alley then you may want to watch a few episodes on comedy central before splurging for an entire season. Who am I kidding, if you don't know South Park at this point just take a cyanide capsule and take a permanent nap.",NA,"24 September 2005"
"532","This show was probably one of the most funniest and satirical shows out here was part of the 90's animation Renaissance which lasted from 1989 to 2014.
When the show first started which was inspired by a web short that became famous in 1995 and was considered the first viral video. It wasn't a satire masterpiece but just a funny show with some jabs of satire of US culture and was just simply a funny show to watch.
But when Season 4 the show became better and they also became 4th graders came on the show still kept its comedy of the kids being kids and it also started to get more satirical with politics and various subjects happening in the US which was done smart and funny and yet be true to the series with its weird sense of humor and edgy jokes for the alternative audience. Although they still slightly did it in the older season like the episode ""The Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka"" made fun of the ""Trash TV"" genre just that now more of the episodes were going to take that slight turn of direction. But when season 12 came around it got a lil less funny and smart and have gotten just more stupider by trying to use jokes that use feces and urine 
which were done in a un-funny way like they used to do these types of jokes but where done not to the extreme and often But around season 18 that when the show had a big downgrade got political but this time they would not use satire and the jokes they tried to do were un-funny as hell. To add to that the kids changed to being smart funny and jerks to now just boring and lost every single traits like Kyle going anginst Terrace and Philip which was just stupid and taken to serious this season was the worst i ever seen and should be ignored. The show has gotten to serious to be called South Park.The show lost it satire and go overboard in to politics to the point where i can just watch the news to here about that. Its the news just in animated form and the jokes are not even funny only one joke made me laugh about the Eric Cartman's song about suicide was funny show if you agree with me do not watch the show on the network Comedy Central and watch it on a bootleg site so they do not get any extra ratings so if you want to see how bad it is watch on there to bust there balls. Note Only giving season 1-11 a 10 the rest of it is pretty much bad.","10","22 June 2018"
"533","""South Park"" can be labeled as 'dumb humor' by those who have not watched the program. On the contrary, South Park delivers a contemporary, political, and current event oriented view of the society we live in. The only thing they change from everything else you've seen; they make it funny AND informative! Whether it's Katrina, Racism, the war on Iraq, or IMMIGRATION (before it was an issue), ""South Park"" has a fresh and intelligent way of delivering their views and being entertaining at the same time. Their presentation provides an equal balance of liberal or conservative views that lacks in the media today. Their program has the power to announce or denounce the views you believe in and are unparalleled to any program that can obtain that balance. It's easy to label ""South Park"" as 'dumb humor,' but spend a half hour a week watching this show and you might reconsider your disposition. South Park is informative, opinionated, political, and yes, very entertaining. This may not be the Holy Grail of television shows, but it will make you pray that it have no need to be resurrected.","10","12 June 2006"

"535","South Park is the most repulsive and disgusting cartoon show on tv. It is offensive, often quite sickening, the language is filthy and the show is completely immature...AND I LOVE IT!!! South Park is without a doubt the goddamn funniest show EVER and Trey Parker and Matt Stone deserve,like, 50 Emmys!!! The description I was talking about before, yeah, I agree with it, but thats what makes it as good as it is! It is a TV show that after watching every episode makes you say ""oh my god, I dont believe what theyre doing!!"" Some people say ""Oh, South Park is so EVIL, how can you watch something so stupid?"" but I will never stop watching, and loving, South Park!!",NA,"17 October 2002"

"538","...according to an overnight study, this episode was the highest rated South Park episode ever among adults 18-34 who have attended the Blue Collar Comedy Tour. seriously though, my reasons for believing this to be one of the weakest south park satires to date include: - whole episode built around a cheesy and weak pun (""smog""-""smug""- not too funny) - ""people in san francisco are so into themselves they love the smell of their own farts"" intended as episodes biggest laughs, was not intelligent, insightful, or hilarious. - trey and matt were off on many cultural insights. i found it telling that they depicted the California grade schoolers as drug addled while kyle was oblivious to drugs, as if midwesterners (much less people in Colorado) don't do drugs. Take that cali!Everything in the episode tended to be obvious (liberals are smug do gooders, Hollywood is out of touch (which has been said so often it has become cliché), etc. In fact, in his Oscar speech clooney was being somewhat daring by bucking this ""truism,"" trumpeted endlessly fox news and its like, and suggesting that Hollywood can be ahead of the curve, too. my only real laugh came as the clooney cloud said ""i am the sexiest man alive."" South Park is probably my favorite show, but it really peaked by season 8. 9 had its moments. chef episode was funny.","10","30 March 2006"
"539","This show is simply the best on TV! Certainly the four first episodes (well, some of four already sucked big ass) are really great, but now it's getting worse. The two episodes of season seven are just the worst piece of craps I've ever seen (=> the stories don't make sense at all anymore, can't they just do something with their town and Stan, Kyle, Kenny (and why does he doesn't die anymore ??) and Cartman? And Cartman his voice isn't funny anymore, in 'Weight gain 4000' it kicked ass).Although some episodes from five and six are great, but you should watch it yourself. But SP is still the most funniest program I've ever seen and the dirty language is so awesome.Go watch the first seasons, avoid the last. And let's hope that Matt and Trey get back to the early years and let Kenny die again!",NA,"30 March 2003"
"540","The show overall if funny for its major swearing to Kenny dying in very graphic ways, the show has best moments where we could all share a laugh.My favorite episode was S7E15: It's Christmas in Canada.Forgotten characters:The most forgotten characters are Canadians (such as Terrance and Phillip, Scott the Dick, the Duke of Canada, Celine Dion and more.), Starvin' Marvin, Principal Victoria, Mr. Hankey, Scott Tenorman. Satan (Died), Saddam Hussein, Dr. Mephesto (returned in vaccination special), Ms. Crabree (dead), Chef (also dead) and Jason White (dead yet again). That is all for forgotten characters.Rating: 10/10 :D.","10","12 June 2021"
"541","This is a good show overall, the excessive swearing makes it funnier than most shows, the infamous line ""Oh my god, they killed Kenny!

"542","I never heard of south park until 2006. One of my 7 year old cousin was watching it and my older brother said that that isn't something she's suppose to be watching. One night I saw that it was on and decided to give it a try. The whole episode kept me interested for some reason. After it all finished I realise that what they were talking about was real stuff and what is going on in the world. From then on I got pulled into it and i'm watching every episode that I can.I give it a TEN for being one of the best shows of television. Hope other people would give it a try and see what happens, i'm pretty sure you wouldn't be disappointed","10","29 May 2007"
"543","This is the best show television has ever seen for many reasons.  Those of you who think it is pure toilet humor and fart jokes, like it was in the beginning (in the before time, in the long-long ago, lmao), then you are completely wrong.  Ever since the end of the second season, the creators, the near-demigod Matt Stone and Trey Parker, have instilled the most clever humor ever seen in television into their series.  The Simpsons, above everything, is stupid humor.  Just because it's been on the air longer and is watched by more people doesn't mean its humor is cleverer, it just means it appeals to more people.  Seinfeld has intelligent humor, but nothing even CLOSE to this.  Curb Your Enthusiasm, Just Shoot Me, Friends and others are shows that are very funny but are dwarfed when compared to the pure genius of South Park.South Park not only makes fun of things we encounter in our own everyday lives, which the other aforementioned shows do, but they also make fun of political issues brilliantly.  Anyone who saw the 100th episode knows this full well.  It's the most intelligent humor on television.  The fart jokes and toilet humor were abandoned a very long time ago.  Now the show is 100 times funnier than before because it's that much more slick.  Folks, this is undoubtedly the best thing ever to happen to television; if you don't get it, your sense of humor needs to be adjusted and/or you need to re-evaluate your life.  This is the funniest material ever to grace a television set. Ever.I will simply list the reasons why South Park is the funniest show on television.1) It has both overt and covert jokes, making each episode funnier to watch because of the way you discover something new every time you watch it (little known fact: in the Jakovasaurs episode, try pronouncing the airline with a French accent.  You oughta get a kick out of it).2) The clever political humor is like none other and makes you want to laugh every time you watch the news because of how stupid you know world affairs have become when put into the hands of Trey Parker and Matt Stone.3) The voices are absolutely incredible, and Trey and Matt are incredibly talented voice actors.4) It gets to the point that you find yourself constantly laughing out of nowhere because every time you see something on the street, you can relate it to that one funny moment in a South Park episode.5) Running down a list of characters never to be forgotten in comedy history: Kyle's cousin Kyle, Jimmy, Timmy, Towelie, the Prehistoric Ice Man from 1996, Kevin, Alex, Chief Runswithpremise, the Underpants Gnomes, Hat, The Ghost of Human Kindness, and many others that I have probably overlooked.",NA,"13 May 2003"
"544","alright, alright, technically, i ""shouldn't"" be watching south park, since i'm not 17 [i'm actually 14], but i don't care!! this is the best goddamn animated show, with the simpsons coming 2nd. speaking of the simpsons, i loved the ep. with the boys' sea men, and how butters [professor chaos] kept thinking of ways to destroy the earth, but general disarray kept saying ""simpsons did it! simpsons did it!"" the animators tried making everything look like the simpsons thru butter's view, which was hilarious. even though this show is nasty at times, i still luv it, and the dirtiest one i've seen is probably the lord of the rings one.my favorite characters are butters, kyle, tweek, and mr. garrison. he's so gay, but really funny! and i enjoy seeing the character Pip, cuz in school i just finished reading Great Expectations [SNORE] and Pip is the main character in it.some other episodes that i liked: chickenlover, fun w/veal, freak strike [maury show], fat camp, tweek vs. craig, cripple fight [big gay al!!!] chicken pox, the list goes on! one ep. i especially liked was the one when cartman figured out that if he puts food up his ass, he could crap thru his mouth. and Cartman's dad mystery!!! 2 part episode. very very very funny.the new season is off to a great start! the creators are so clever, i almost thought for a second that they were showing a repeat of the alien episode.
my point is, this show kicks MAJOR ass!!!!!!",NA,"22 March 2003"
"545","though this show may be crude, there is a lot of clever humor as well some slapstick humor and a fart joke here and there to make a combination that can't be beat. one of the reasons why this show is so funny is because trey and matt are always willing to make fun of subjects that many shows would never think of touching. they also always manage to slip in some advice and moral lessons here and there (though you should be REALLY careful about which parts of the shows  you actually take to heart). trey and matt, keep it up!",NA,"22 August 2003"
"546","""South Park"" has been one of my favorite shows for the past 10 years. It basically follows the adventures of four foul-mouthed little boys and their families, friends, and neighbors, in a small mountain town in Colorado. It is one of the few shows I find to be consistently funny. It tends to be very raunchy and inappropriate, but underneath all of the 'offensive' content there is often biting social commentary. Although, sometimes it's just funny for funny's sake. At any rate, it's one of the best shows on television and definitely THE funniest animated show on TV right now. It's edgy, satirical, and just plain hilarious. The easily offended probably should avoid it, but anyone who enjoys satire and social commentary will probably find it incredibly entertaining.","10","9 October 2006"
"547","Season 8 shows that just when you thought the show couldn't get any better , the comedy gets upped by many notches , the dialogues get nastier , and the characters start kicking ass once again .I mean in one episode , the animation turns to anime suddenly and switches back and forth , and in another, Stan is helping cute animals build for Christmas , only to find out they are doing it for bringing Satan on earth !What could be greater than that? Hats off to Matt and Trey , hope they can do even better in 9! Though I missed Chef and other people like Jimbo and Mr. Garrison , they weren't there a lot this time .As for people who think that the episodes are only getting more offensive , I implore them to open their eyes and look more closely at the deep symbolism hidden beneath each episode and how it ridicules things going on in modern America and the world as a whole . I can't help but wonder how beautifully Stan , Kyle , Eric and Kenny encompass four basic sections of society : the average white American , people of other races , the angry intolerant redneck male , and the poor neglected American . Believe me or not , there's something important to learn from every episode for each section of society , including Mel Gibson .In a nutshell , Matt and Trey , rock on ! Tim Tim Temmah!",NA,"24 December 2004"
"548","This show is drivel and jumped the shark. These last few years must only appeal to cretins and they remind me of the last few years of The Simpsons. The last good seasons of The Simpsons were 3-8. The best episode ever was Rosebud. Lately it's all been drivel. Surely people can't enjoy this? They're cretins. This show is appalling. I'm appalled by this show. It's garbage. It's disgusting. Is this what passes for entertainment in today's society of mindless sheep? The problem is that society has jumped the shark. Cretins have jumped the shark. Cretins eat drivel for breakfast, the drivel that these shows pump out. Where's my mommy? Drivel.","10","3 November 2011"
"549","South Park is a show based on four kids in a small town. Somehow every big news story affects this town. Then they pretty much poke at the story and make it dumb and unimportant. They take story that everyone is obsessing about and make it so stupid you have to laugh. They are crazy and will make fun of anything and everything, but it still makes me laugh. The show making everything dumb and funny has kept veiwers in for years and probably many more.South Park keeps itself fresh and probably will be around for many other years. So everything in South Park is funny, but you really have to be in America to laugh, or get ti. It is still funny and it makes me laugh. So hooray for South Park!",NA,"17 April 2004"

I know that Isaac Hayes is a Scientologist and wonder if he'll continue to work on the show after his beloved religion just got skewered with no mercy.

They then tried to play it of as just a word, also not okay. And the climate change denial for a good while also bad. It's just mean, it's not satire to say slurs. And Before I can enjoy this and before you should it's important to acknowledge it's SERIOUS issues. But it's really funny, it's got good characters and I love it. If you want something to simply enjoy this is it. I hate to review it so high for its lack of anything else but really for what it is to me I watch this for the characters, the comedy and just that it's really fun. It has its issues and the creators really need to acknowledge and apologize but it's just a really fun show. I can't forgive the anti the transphobia, racism (the drawings and representation of asian people), the ableism or even as a gay person I can't forgive the f slur. I don't forgive the show (until the creators apologize out right) but I still enjoy it for the fact it's funny and it honestly does grow over time.

There is literally a joke in every episode to please everyone.I hope this show continues airing for years and years to come. I hope to show my children this show (when they get older of course). My only negative about this show is that the latest season has NOT been that funny except for the Human Centipede episode.

"561","South Park is an amazing show, even though it is inappropriate for younger viewers. With all the characters and the different happenings in different episode, it is a forever unique series.One of the (best) things about the series is the in-show television series the boys are always watching calling Terrance and Phillip; as the boys are forever being entertained and influenced by the stupidity seen on the show (just like how some adults see South Park to be a bad influence on kids). Even if the show isn't humorous at some points, it is always entertaining as there is some sort of suspense that keeps the viewers entertained to keep watching the show (like how Kenny will die).","9","16 May 2013"
