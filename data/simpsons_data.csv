"1","Brilliant television series that could probably be best described as ""The Flintstones"" gone stark-raving mad. ""The Simpsons"", everyone knows them. Some love the series and some could care less about it. Love it or hate it, it is near impossible to criticize the intelligence and creativity of this series. The titled animated family makes their home in Springfield, USA and gets into situations that are seemingly more outlandish and crazier than the previous adventure. Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are still going strong after nearly a dozen years of television life and with each passing moment it seems that the series sets some new precedent. For several years the show seemed to be the only attraction to the then obscure Fox Network. It was the first primetime animated show that was treated like a sitcom since ""The Flintstones"" quietly left the air in 1966. Many people feared the series when it first premiered in 1989 because they felt that it was hardcore adult material in a candied form that would appeal to younger audiences. Well for the most part this was true. However, ""The Simpsons"" would prove to be much more for all audiences. The great thing about the series is that it caters to all audiences. True there are usually situations that may not be suitable for all viewers, but then again that is true with everything on television this side of Disney Land and Sesame Street. ""The Simpsons"" works because of great comedy of course, but also great lessons that can be taken from most of the episodes. The people within the program may be animated, but they are just as complicated and vulnerable as the people watching them. All the regulars have their quirks, but in some episodes you can understand what certain characters are going through because the show is so life-like at times. Former President George Bush (the one from 1988-1992) once made a statement that families should be more like ""The Waltons"" and less like ""The Simpsons"". His opinion is somewhat old-fashioned and unrealistic. In other words, many topics dealt with in ""The Simpsons"" fit life for people in the 1990s and 2000s better than ""The Waltons"" did in the 1970s. A crowning achievement in television art. 5 stars out of 5.",NA,"21 July 2001"
"2","The Simpsons is the longest running animated TV series since The Flinstones, and you could understand why after watching just one of the Simpsons episodes. Simply because The Simpsons is just so hilarious and incredibly clever and has been ripped off so many times, but nothing has come close to the brilliance that the Simpsons writers have brought us.We have Homer Simpson, one of the most beloved TV characters of all time, with his famous quote ""Doh!"". He's an overweight, lazy, and not the brightest bulb, but so incredibly lovable for the fact of how bipolar he is! One minute he can be so incredibly depressed, but the next minute really happy and giggling. My favorite Homer quote is when he kills the zombie Ned Flanders in a Halloween episode, Bart tells him ""Dad! You killed the zombie Flanders!""... ""He was a zombie?"" Marge is Homer's wife and a homemaker. She is at times naggy, but always manages to get in some terrific humor and some deep sympathy with all she puts up with. My favorite Marge quote is ""Bart, don't make fun of grad students. They've just made a terrible life choice."" Bart is the oldest son and a rebel. His usual quotes are ""Don't have a cow"" ""Cool, man!"" ""Ei Carumba!"". He's this generation's Dennis the Menace. My favorite Bart quote is ""I need a soul, Ralph, any, your's!"", you'll see what I mean.Lisa is the second oldest and the smartie pants of the Simpson clan, she's kind of the know it all who solves all the adventures of the Simpsons. My favorite Lisa quote is ""They're only using you for your pool you know... shut up brain! I have friends now, I don't need you any more!"". Last, but not least, Maggie, the eternal baby of Homer and Marge, always a great love of the screen, but no famous quotes, just memorable moments like when she turns into an alien.The supporting cast is a terrific addition, my favorites include Mr. Burns, Homer's boss, Groundskeeper Willy, the school janitor, and Mr. Skinner, the school principal. The Simpson is just a terrific show that in one way or another you will see at least one episode in your lifetime. I know that generations to come, they will still be watching The Simpsons.",NA,"12 November 2003"
"3","The series that follows the dysfunctional family of the Simpsons.  The oafish Homer who can barely go a day without slacking or getting mixed up in crazy adventures. His wife, Marge, who tries to hold it all together.  His duaghter Lisa who is smarter that her gene pool should allow, Bart <U+0096> every inch the classroom rebel.  The family is rounded out by the youngest <U+0096> baby Maggie.  The family interact with those around them and learn lessons or sometimes fail to change completely.When this series started in 1987 as a string of rough shorts in Tracey Ulman's show it would be a brave man who would have predicted that over a decade later that this series would be as huge as it is.  However the series got launched with the Christmas special in the early 90's.  The first series saw the animation greatly improved and the characters developed fully to be more involving.  However the story lines were not as sharp or as full as they were to be.  The second series and onwards saw the Simpsons have better stories <U+0096> often multi-layered stories filled with pop-culture references and background jokes that reward the careful viewer<U+0085>to try and list them would take ages.For an American sitcom (for that is what it is) this is amazing <U+0096> the intelligence of the script is fantastic.  The depth of the stories are involving, witty and packed.  For a movie buff like me, this is a gold mine <U+0096> from sly references in the background to full blow scenes almost spoofing movies this has them all. In some programmes that have background jokes the main stuff at the front often suffers or is ignored totally.  However here the main plot and dialogue is fresh and well thought out <U+0096> it is amazing that for almost all of it's run The Simpsons rarely had a bad episode.True <U+0096> recent shows have begun to show a slide in quality but this is to be expected after more than 10 years at the top.  However it is generally brilliant and clever.  After the first series everything improved.  Not only was the series used for political comment, satire and ironic humour (in a country that generally can't do any well) but it is also heart warming and funny.The characters live in a balance between reality and surreality.  They are sort of recognisable as real people in terms of habits and experiences <U+0096> but in another way they are out there<U+0085>..Homer has been in Space, stopped a nuclear explosion etc.  The mix of this makes for an unique programme.  What makes it better is that the makers never draw a line between the madness and the normality <U+0096> one episode is made up of a bad-neighbour type war between Homer and George Bush Snr!  The mix is seamless and adds layers to each show.The wealth of characters is another strength. The main family is strong <U+0096> even Maggie has regular input and adventures!  However where most sitcoms really rely on their main subjects for the stories, The Simpsons has a supporting cast of dozens and dozens of really good characters <U+0096> all of whom are able to carry an episode.  They range from the normal characters (an inept  Police Chief, an Asian shop keeper who is used to being robbed at gunpoint) to the referential or well imagined, (the well-educated Sideshow Mel, a bitter Krusty the Clown, an useless lawyer).  All the characters have become more fully used as time has gone on.The voice actors are all excellent and all do a huge range of voices<U+0085>of course they get very well paid for it!  Unfortunately the late Phil Hartman provided the voices of two of my favourite characters and I really miss his dry humour and strong all-American voice.  Lionel Hutz was a great character and my favourite, Troy McClure is a wonderful spoof of 60's B-movie actor Doug McClure.  This depth really helps the show and has allowed it to feel so very fresh years on.I could go on for ever, but the series is a wonderful bit of proof that sitcoms don't have to be simple, full of canned laughter and focus on sassy teenagers!  The joys of the dialogue are backed up by movie references and crazy adventures.  The wonderful Simpson family are supported by a huge cast of imaginative characters who are always well used and a queue of celebrities just lining up to have a few minutes in the show. Quite simply this is consistently the best show to come out of American in my life time.",NA,"20 April 2002"
"4","i have yet to see something as funny, clever and entertaining as ""The Simpsons"" on TV. I'm hardly a TV-series buff, I rarely have the patience and interest to follow a show for more than five or six episodes. ""The Simpsons"" is the one show that I am very sorry to have missed out on until just a couple of years ago. Luckily, Swedish television are rerun experts. It is also the only show that I make sure to follow apart from perhaps ""Friends"", but in entertainment value, ""The Simpsons"" is way ahead.What makes this show so great is its attention to detail, its outrageous dialogue and its completely fearless way of dealing with any issue that crosses the writers' minds. The many characters and their extravaganza makes it an endless well of new angles, new ideas and even more outrageous dialogues. Another very important element is the mocking irony and sarcasm which permeates the entire series. The smarmy and cheesy moments that a great many episodes end up in are extremely clever and becomes an important part of the fun.What impresses me the most about the series is, however, the enormous amount of detail: the attentive spectator is not just in for the obvious gags - there's always something going on or something to read in the background, which makes a VCR mandatory so you can go back and check that special detail out again. Its a fantastic show, and its a great moment when one can sit down and watch another insane, stupid, disastrous and hilarious episode.",NA,"5 February 2001"
"5","The Simpsons is a show that has sustained ten years of constant humor.  The stories have gradually become better and the second fiddle characters were getting more screen time which translates into a much more realized show. The pop culture references abound and delight those who can pick them out. My personal favorite is the Citizen Kane references in the episode called ""Rosebud.""  Plus, anything with C. Montgomery Burns is hysterical.  The guest stars aren't there as a ""special appearance"" touted by the networks. They actually work into the storyline, and that makes it all the more enjoyable.  Where else can you see The Moody Blues acting like thugs in a Vegas casino?",NA,"17 January 1999"
"6","The Simpsons was an amazing show until after season 6 and then was still good until around season 12. It became decent after that and really went into ""meh"" territory after season 20-ish.The biggest problem with the Simpsons is that it has lost it's magic and has become all about woke and appeasing the vocal minority. Examples of this are removing Apu from the show, removing an actor from voicing a character(s) because they aren't the proper skin color, and have removed episodes/content (this isn't new but removing Stark Raving Dad is new).","6","1 October 2021"
"7","First 10 seasons classic, funny and enjoyable fun show to watch. Half way through season 11 it starts to go meh but then after that the more seasons made through out the years the worse and worse it gets. How is this show still on going today is mind blowing. The humour isn't funny at all anymore. The couch gags drag on for what feels like 3-5 minutes. Ideas for each episode are running dry. There is even a Halloween episode that relies on fart jokes. Hope it ends at season 30.","6","29 October 2017"
"8","When I was 10, I adored the Simpsons, America's favourite dysfunctional family. Me and my brother and sisters watched it every day after school, and got a bagful of laughs. Two years ago though, I stopped watching it. Maybe I didn't find it as funny, creative or as original anymore. Well after seeing the Simpsons Movie, I decided to give the show another chance. And I am glad I did, because it is smart, creative, funny AND original. It is true that the show has been declining in written quality the past three years or so, but the more recent seasons are still watchable, thanks to the animation and the endearing characters.The show's animation is fantastic. In animated shows, I like animation that is colourful and fluid, and the animation in this show is exactly that. The theme tune is irresistibly catchy and the story lines are outstandingly good. Other than the voice acting what made the show so good was its writing. Not obnoxious or childish, but smart and most importantly funny. And the visual jokes are also impressive.And the voice acting is exceptional bringing the dysfunctional family to life. Homer is a type of father figure who repeatedly lets down his family, has a love for doughnuts and beer and pretty much hates his job. Dan Castallenetta, a talented voice actor whom I fondly remember as Megavolt from Darkwing Duck, does a great job not only as Homer but as Grandpa and Krusty, not loud and abrasive at all but just right. Julie Kavner is also great as Marge, a caring matriarch who genuinely cares for her family. Nancy Cartwright is perfect as Bart, who is quite naughty and hates school, same with Yeardley Smith as studious Lisa. Plus Maggie is absolutely adorable.Then there are the supporting characters. My favourite is Grandpa, he is absolutely hilarious. Hank Azaria is amusing as Moe and Chief Wiggum, and Harry Shearer is suitably chirpy as Ned and impresses equally with his monotonic drawls for Principal Skinner and Reverend Lovejoy. There are many memorable guest performances from various celebrities, and frequent appearances from Phil Hartmann and Tress MacNeille. My favourite is Kelsey Grammar as Sideshow Bob, a reprising villain I enjoy watching, sinister yet funny. All in all, despite the fact it isn't as enjoyable as it was, The Simpsons is still a great show. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox","9","8 January 2010"
"9","The Simpsons was my de facto go-to comedy from 1992 until the movie came out. Based on other reviews here, it appears that I hung in a lot longer than most. But I gave up eventually.From 1992 until 2007 I used to record, save, and constantly re-watch the Simpsons on VHS. Once the DVDs started coming out, I would buy every single box set and watch those to death as well. I used to drive my friends nuts with quoting lines or referring to episodes. I looked forward to every episode, what new disaster Homer could get into, and what goofy plot they would come up next. I loved every diverse and wacky character and how they all interacted with each other, good or bad. The writing was top notch, the parody of real-life things was great, and voice acting was flat-out superb. From the time I started watching until the early 2000's, it was heavenly. From 2002 - 2006, it started showing some signs of weakening, but still managed to make me laugh.Then the movie came out in 2007.It had a few moments (Marge's choice words about the bomb got my one ""out loud"" laugh), but it felt lackluster and pandered to a generic audience instead of staying really true to the diehards that were with the show since the beginning. The movie also marked the start of the show eventually going to CG versus traditional animation.And here is where things start changing. Eventually, the writing went from meh (and later super-meh) to flat out lazy and about as funny as a terminal disease. Since CG animation no-doubt faster to produce than hand-drawn, the Simpsons went from feeling hand-made to mass-produced. This effect eventually seemed to spill over into all aspects of the show. Despite this, I was willing stick it out so long as it made me laugh, but it stopped doing that and I just couldn't bear to watch any longer. For me, it was really like a dear friend or relative was dying before my very eyes, albeit slowly and painfully.But what really buried it for me was when that loser and complete no-talent ""comedian"" Hari Kondabolu cried and whined that Apu was somehow an insult to the entire Indian race (a farcical cartoon character, really?) which eventually stopped Hank Azaria from voicing it. Congrats Hari, you ruined one of my favorite characters on the show. What is it that you are known for again? Oh right, we're still waiting for all the brilliant comedy that you have yet to produce. It appears that Hank will no longer be voicing Carl either, who is now replaced by a ""correctly-raced"" actor. Because, you know, the earth was going to explode or something if that wasn't done. I supposed it's just a matter of time until Dr. Nick Riviera will be saying ""Bye Everybody!"" as well.But it's OK, I've reached the level of acceptance and abandoned the show several years ago. I honestly don't know anyone who still watches this show either, but for those that still do I would ask that you please stop. Let the viewership die so that the show can die right along with it. It really needs to be put out its misery at this point. Every once in a while, I catch a glimpse of recent episodes when switching channels and most of the voice actors sound tired. I'm sure this is easy money for them by now, but really, I would think they are all talented enough to do other voice work in many other places. Or not - maybe they all need to retire. Poor Julie Kavner's voice sounds like it's practically gone now.There was a time when I used to hope the state that Springfield is in would be revealed in the final episode, but now? I couldn't care less. What once was a show that screwed with the established order eventually got swallowed up by it and drowned in a sea of political correctness. I sold off my Simpsons box sets years ago and moved on to other things. The classic version of the show still exists for me now, but only in my memories. It's a world where Apu does not want anyone offering Ganesha a peanut, but he does ask us to ""Come again!"".","5","9 December 2020"
"10","Network: Fox; Genre: Animated Comedy, Parody, Satire; Content Rating: TV-PG (language, adult contend and animated nudity); Available: DVD and syndication everywhere; Perspective: Classic (star range: 1 - 5);Seasons Reviewed: Season 12+ If someone had told me 10 years ago that I would one day be bored by 'The Simpsons', I would have called them crazy. But here we are and while 'The Simpsons' has become the longest running show on TV at the cost of its core integrity. ""Simpsons"" in its prime was the best things to grace the small screen. A funny, ground-breaking animated comedy with lightening-quick wit, insightful social and brilliantly integrated parody. It created its own universe with an entire town of original characters. Most importantly, it actually helped shape the sense of humor of an entire generation. That generation which has now grown up and is now creating animated shows in direct competition. ""Simpsons"" is a pale shadow of its former greatness. It gradually slipping this way for several years, but it wasn't until the 2002 and 2003 seasons that the show really smashed up against the rocks for good. I used to delight in each new episode of ""Simpsons"". But now the show clunks along each week in what appears to be filling time. The free-wheeling gags it used to deliver with such ease are now weighted down by an unnecessary over importance on story. The show at its best may get off a funny, sharp one-liner every now and then. It's biggest asset currently is it's willingness and given latitude to slam its own network. I do delight in their ""Joe Millionaire"" on-air promo parodies or a recent episode where Homer calls to give the network an idea and the recording says something like ""If you know of another network's reality show we can rip off, press 2..."" So what happened? There really is no one thing that can easily be pointed out to all the late-commers and say ""this is what happened"" - you have to have traced the history. The 'jump the shark' moment could have come as early as the infamous Frank Grimes episode where our vision of The Simpson family was suddenly turned into something to aspire to instead of parody. It could be the legion of big name celebrities forced into every episode. To bring down a show as great as this, it was a slow convergence of several things. Watching it, 3 differences are evident on-screen at any given time: First, the stripping down most of the characters to 1-note cartoons. Notably, British favorite Homer Simpson going from child-like, hard-luck father to a rag-doll for wild animals to rip apart as each episode closes. I'm particularly appalled at its attempts to use Homer as a political mouthpiece. Did you know that a guy who once lit a Q-tip so he could see inside his brain has an active concern for global politics? Yeah, I didn't either. Secondly, the classic Baby Boomer voice of the series has evaporated and was replaced with contemporary generation X and Y jokes. Now, it's the internet and Tony Hawke. The voice of the series used to be one of creator Matt Groening's, seen through the eyes of Homer and Marge. That voice has been lost as the show has turned into an assembly line institution, repackaged and been homogenized for the masses and a new generation of writers lead by Ian Maxton-Graham has come in to ""keep it fresh"". Thirdly, it has run out of creative juice. Anyone who has stuck with the show long enough can see it literally re-telling jokes and recycle previous story lines. When the recycling becomes too obvious or the episode makes no sense, they merely double back and declare it all a big self-parody. Not even Al Jean (architect of the show in its prime and the Larry David of ""The Simpsons"") can save it now. Since the talented voice cast has remained the same low these many years, I put all the blame on this squarely with the Fox network who refused to let this show go out gracefully when Groening siphoned off his role to work on his dream project, the now far superior 'Futurama'. In Fox's race to claim this endurance record they have turned a once edgy and visionary show into an institution with an assembly line production and revolving door of writers to match any of the other lame shows on TV. Behind the scenes, maybe the condescending we-can-do-no-wrong attitude of Maxton-Graham has dealt the show its biggest death blow, while producer Mike Scully sat back and ineptly let Maxton-Graham run it into the ground. In the end, the biggest blame may actually land with the ""die-hard fans"" that embolden the show by letting it get away with this junk. Yes, ""The Simpsons"" was ground-breaking and every adult animation in the future owns it a bit of gratitude, but blind loyalty to a show only for how it performed in the past isn't healthy. Since it has hit long-running status the critical bandwagon jumping has begun and ""Simpsons"" is more popular than ever amongst critics that want to be on the inside of history. We've now reached a point where the bad episodes and bad entire seasons outweigh the good and that, I'm afraid, is going to be the sad legacy of ""Simpsons"" . A train-wreck of crass, childish humor, grainy animation, oddly misplaced satire and forced parodies of only the most obvious pop culture targets. 10 years ago I didn't know what I would do without ""The Simpsons"" but now, particularly with the emergence of satisfying new adult animated shows ('Futurama', 'Family Guy' and 'South Park'), living without it might be pretty good. * * / 5",NA,"25 January 2004"
"11","For the first 8 seasons or so that it was on the air, ""The Simpsons"" was one of the greatest television shows of all time. Wonderfully developed characters, biting satire and top-notch writing made this cartoon a joy to watch. However, the show began to slide in season nine, and while it remained watchable through season ten or so, it has now become a shell of its former self. From about season 13 on, this formerly awesome show became the kind of ""entertainment"" it once parodied so well.Several factors have contributed to the sorry drop in quality of the show. First, Homer's character has changed. He used to be a bumbling idiot, but had some good qualities. He has now morphed into a super-annoying, always in-your-face kind of moron. There is nothing likable about the new Homer. As for the other characters, Marge has become as morally bankrupt as Homer and is not likable either. Lisa, always a weak character, is now a little spokesperson for the Democratic Party. She spews out more propaganda than the ""Weekend Update"" no-talents on SNL. An eight-year old Buddhist? Come on! Bart has become less of a creative troublemaker, and is now more of a wimpy sidekick to Homer. The killing of Maude Flanders was inexcusable, and characters like Milhouse and Moe have become sometimes frighteningly weird (references to Milhouse-a ten year old boy-being gay and/or a cross dresser, for instance). Apu having all those kids was absurd. The shows now revolve around ""wild and crazy"" plots, with Homer constantly in the forefront. There is the constant, unnecessary use of blood and gore (Homer seems to always be cutting off something, and we are supposed to think it's funny). Also, the gratuitous use of guest stars is sickening. They are never funny, and serve only to promote and glorify themselves. ""The Simpsons"" used to poke fun at these pretentious celebrities. If this show stays on the air just a few more years, there will be more bad shows in syndication than good ones.The DVD season-by-season sets are great, and really serve to remind us of how far this once incredible show has fallen. I'd advise everyone to buy these boxed sets and remember the great writing, inventive plots and brilliant characterizations that flourished during the first 8 seasons of the greatest cartoon series in history.","4","28 May 2005"

"13","Originally ""The Simpsons"" were animated segments on ""The Tracy Ullman Show"" before they got their own series, which became a mega-hit. And what has made them so popular? Perhaps good timing; animated sitcoms meant for adults were a novelty at the time. Yes, the show does have some wit, and the stories are fast-paced. But even it its salad days, it wasn't as funny as all that. Basically, it's a standard sitcom idea that's been done many times before-stupid father, smart mother who puts up with everything, smart kids who really know what's going on (or so they believe), with liberal propaganda thrown in.The series still goes on, even though many viewers complain that the show went downhill by the end of the 1990's. What makes it continue? It has a cult following and still gets viewers, and FOX seems to want to milk it for all it's worth, and more. And that's why I compare ""The Simpsons"" to the Rolling Stones, a band that continues by living off its past image.","4","23 September 2013"
"14","What more can I possibly say about a TV show that has already been praised to death?  I was 15 when the Simpsons first aired and I'm 25 now.  I've seen every single episode, and I'd have to say it's a rare combination of factors that come together to make The Simpsons the best show ever.It's a very clever and intelligent show - they never dumb anything down - and as creator Matt Groening has remarked, ""The Simpsons is a show that rewards paying attention.""  There are always enough obscure pop-culture references or subtle background gags to ensure that the second, third, or tenth viewing of an episode will find you noticing something you hadn't before.In the early days of The Simpsons, they derived a large part of their popularity from the everyday, down-to-earth, unglamorous, average-blue-collar-slob aspect of the Simpson family.  Homer is lazy and doesn't like his job, Bart doesn't excel at school, the plastic ketchup bottle they use at the dinner table makes that farting sound, and so on. This aspect of the program contrasts it with popular 80's family sitcoms such as The Cosby Show which always featured impossibly well-functioning families who got along a little too perfectly and usually learned a neat little lesson at the end of each episode.  An early tag-line for The Simpsons said that they ""put the Fun back in Dysfunctional.""Perhaps this blue-collar-slobness by itself is nothing shockingly original - think of previous TV shows such as Roseanne, Married with Children, All in the Family, The Honeymooners - but the Simpsons doesn't stop there.  This show is extremely densely packed with jokes - everything from cerebral witticisms and sly satire to Homer falling down and going ""D'oh!""  Because it's a cartoon, the writers can get away with surreal gags such as the time Homer tells a joke which falls flat, after which a long silence happens which is punctuated by a single tumbleweed rolling through the Simpson's living room.There are just too many things to mention about The Simpsons.  It can be touching occasionally; more often the viewers are treated to an unequalled cavalcade of obscure references, surreal sight gags, wacky adventures, self-mocking irony...   The list goes on and on.  Just watch it, else you're missing out on one of the most important elements of 1990's popular culture.",NA,"5 June 1999"
"15","When the animated TV series ""The Simpsons"" first came out, nobody could image how successful it would become. But they made this a clever TV series: that original family with their silly humor conquered many people. From 1989 until (maybe) almost the end of the 1990's, this was a great TV show. It was very humorous, highly creative and had all the needed ingredients to be a classic.All of the characters are very peculiar and eccentric: Bart, Lisa, Marge and Homer. On the other hand, Maggie is innocent because she's a baby. Marge has that weird hair and Homer is more than just the silliest of all Simpsons: he's the silliest ""family chief"" ever!However, in these last years ""The Simpsons"" has been notoriously going downhill. It isn't that great anymore. It doesn't have that classic status any longer and its humor has become more irritating. It isn't so funny anymore.Now is definitely time to put an end to this TV show. They should have done that years ago. The more time they'll take to finally do it, the more they'll ruin it.",NA,"14 August 2007"

"17","To address the failing quality:The Simpsons once mocked and then it became mainstream pop culture. So that is a cause of why it has declined.And another cause is that there is a new PC comedy trend to laugh at things. As in the audience is expected to laugh at the object itself without having an actual joke behind it. As in, ""This is a computer, Laugh at it!""Because of that we see a transformation of the jokes. The celebrity guests were once the butt of the joke. Mulder and Scully came on and the Simpsons mocked them. Now the joke is the celebrity guest. As in, ""This is Lady Gaga,"" or ""this is Michelle Obama.""They aren't spoofed or satirized in any way, the audience is just asked to laugh at the fact that they have a celebrity guest.And the final reason is the laugh track comedy, in which the Simpsons has none. That is no laugh track. But now the writing sets up the jokes with almost a pause for laughter as if the tracks were there.In the past the jokes were piled onto one another. There would be several jokes stacked right next to one another in a single event. Now it has become joke, pause to acknowledge the joke, continue.But no ones really laughing because it's no longer mocking culture, it's no longer spoofing the celebrity guests, and it's lost virtually all of its edge.","5","25 February 2019"
"18","No one, not even Matt Groening himself, could've imagined that The Simpsons would become as big as it did. Nor could anyone anticipate it could become so cultural. ""D'oh"" is in the dictionary, and it has spawned off several catch-phrases and one liners. Truly, The Simpsons is the biggest thing since Seinfeld! The first three seasons showed them as if they were an actual family. Like the kind of family you'd meet on the street (only a lot more dysfunctional). Homer trying to do the fatherly thing in each episode. Marge being the voice of reason all the time. Lisa and Bart with their sibling rivalry. These first three seasons are not usually sighted as being the best, but they are often brought up when one speaks of ""The Best Episode Ever!"" By Season four, the show took a turn for what may have been the best. It left it's more realistic roots and became more of a satire. With more zany antics and more clever, witty, and often times sophisticated humor, The Simpsons became the most popular family on television. Each episode still contained it's own merits, themes and messages. Seasons 4 to about 10 are often said to be the ""Golden Age"" of The Simpsons.However, as the year 2000 came, fans began to see themselves divided. Those who stuck with the show since it came about in 1989 were quick to jump on how the show changed. The humor became more lurid and toilet like, with antics becoming heavily more unrealistic and zany (to the point where some even say it isn't funny... but stupid). Some characters becoming unrealistically stupid, and the show shifting gears from focusing on Bart to Homer... to everyone outside of the Simpson family. The show also began to see more cumbersome and meaningless plots. Plots that didn't focus on current issues, or that didn't seem to be as strong as older episodes. Despite this, new fans seem to have come about to replace then, and the show continues to remain at the top of its game, even today.I'm sure you all know where I stand on that debate. Nine stars to nine fantastic seasons.","9","1 June 2006"

"20","It's very hard for me to try to put a rating on this show. At one time it was the best comedy series on TV and possibly even the best one ever. Unfortunately it went into a decline after the first ten years or so, and then a steep decline, to the point where it is less than a shadow of what it once was. They really should have quit several years ago, but at this point they might as well just keep going and see how many episodes they can rack up before the plug is finally pulled.","5","7 August 2018"
"21","I love the Simpsons. Correction, I Loved the first 9 seasons of the Simpsons. Back then it had to be the most wittiest, cleverest, enjoyable TV show on the planet. It is for that reason that I find myself in such despair now. Let's face it folks the hey-day of the Simpsons was well over a decade ago. Talk about a show that just doesn't know when to stop. It aggravates me to no end to witness the desperate lengths this show goes to year after year. Every show has a shelf life people and the Simpson is way past its expiration date. I truly think that the only reason it is still on the year is force of habit. Both the public and the Fox network are so used to having on that they shutter at ending it. Trust me, It should end.","4","27 May 2010"
"22","The Simpsons has similarities to other sitcoms, only this show is animated. The animation is very eye catching(where else will you see a show where most of the people are yellow).This show follows the Simpson family. The Simpsons live in Springfield, but the state is never mentioned. The family members are Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The other Simpson is Homer's dad, Abe(Grampa) Simpson.This show has been very successful, and is currently the longest running animated show of all time. Part of the reason for its success is the way they alternate which character is the star of the show. I remember when the show first came out, Bart was considered the star of the show, but after a while, Homer became more of the star. Even though those two characters are the stars of the show, there are certain episodes that focus mainly on one of the other Simpsons, or one of the other characters in Springfield.There are a bunch of other characters in the show, like the depressed bar tender Moe, Homer's drinking buddies Lenny, Carl, and Barney. There is also the Simpson's overly religious neighbors, the Flanders, Homer's boss at the Nuclear Power Plant, Mr. Burns, his boss's assistant, Mr. Smithers, and the Indian guy who runs the Kwikie Mart, Apu. At Bart and Lisa's School, the main characters are Principal Skinner, Bart's friend Milhouse, the bully Nelson, and so many others.That is another reason for the big success of the show, the way that so many characters and character's interests create more and more episodes.When this show was first released, some parents thought it was too dirty and inappropriate for their kids to be watching. This was before Beavis and Butthead, South Park, and Family Guy came out. Today, this show is very tame compared to those shows. That doesn't matter to me though, I love all of the shows that I mentioned above.Another great thing about The Simpsons is how they can get so many celebrities as guest stars. Many times, when a certain episode isn't very good, the celebrity guest star can help save the episode from becoming real bad.Even though The Simpsons has poked fun at religion, it has also been applauded for awareness of other religions.Unfortunately, The Simpsons has started to lose its greatness. While I don't hate it like many others, I do agree that it isn't as sensational as when it was still new and fresh. If the show were to be canceled, that wouldn't be entirely bad. If it is canceled now, then everyone can look back upon how great the original episodes were and not have to worry about the newer ones being worse than the originals.This is a great show, if you haven't seen it, see it as soon as possible.","8","30 May 2005"
"23","I was hesitant to give this the rating I did, but from reading other audience reviews, my review actually will come across as far more... lenient. What can I say that hasn't been said already, the golden age of The Simpsons (seasons 3-8) is flawless television. Going through it again, it was awe inspiring to me how they manage to structure joke upon joke upon joke upon joke, something that must've been a complete breath of fresh air considering the boring, lifeless, milk-toast excuses for comedy shows that were coming around at that time. Yeah, those ones using canned laughter which relied completely on actors and people being loud as an excuse to be funny with a roaring laughter every 5 seconds spoon feeding the audience of when to laugh, with an exception of Seinfeld these were just boring shows for boring people, The Simpsons was intelligent, heart felt, structured and most of all... FUNNY.However, all good things must come to an end. In an ideal scenario, The Simpsons ended on season 10 and season 9 didn't include the infamous 'The Principal and The Pauper', it lives its legacy as one of the greatest TV shows of all time and is passed down from generation to generation. Sure, the season 9 and 10 weren't golden age material, they were still solid entries in The Simpsons canon but then from season 11, things started to drastically change, we were getting episodes which would've been some of the weaker episodes in a golden age era season that were the best episodes of the season they were actually in. Sure, season 13 was pretty good but the show was tanking in quality almost directly after, pretty much season 14 onwards was terrible (not to mention the really bland movie). Now we're on the 31st season, the show is just completely unwatchable, the best episodes are mediocre and boring and the worst episodes are... 'Lisa Goes Gaga' (if you know what I mean). The show, at this point, is almost completely unrecognisable, a mere slight resemblance of what it once was (even the animation sucks nowadays), that's why it's so damn difficult to rate this show, at the same time it's one of my favourite and least favourite shows, the show should've ended 20 years ago, you can't keep lightning in a bottle for that long, it's not a show that is relevant to today's cultural landscape, it would be so much more respected if it had ended on its 10th season. That's why I can't in good conscience rate this show the 9 or 10/10 that I want to... but the only reason I'm giving it a 7 over a 5 is because even though there is more bad than good of The Simpsons (more signals for it to just end), the golden age is some of the best television to have ever been constructed and cannot be ignored.Here's how I'd rate the seasons:
Season 1 - 8/10
Season 2 - 8/10
Season 3 - 9/10
Season 4 - 9/10
Season 5 - 10/10
Season 6 - 10/10 (best season)

"27","The Simpsons is without a doubt one of the funniest and most original shows on television, even as it runs on in years. It is basically an institution in my household and we watch it whenever we can. It's one of the few shows where I can watch episodes again and again and never get bored of them. The show is consistently well written and never seems hard pressed for storylines. And of course, there's Homer Simpson, arguably the greatest and most recognizable character ever created for any medium. The fact that it has been on more than 10 years and is now the longest running sitcom in television history is a testament to it's creativity and appeal. I can't imagine television without this show to brighten my day. Long live the Simpsons and I hope it runs for 10 more years.","9","1 June 2001"
"28","I surprisingly had a very difficult time rating this show, but I did and a 5 out of 10 is in my opinion a fair rating when you consider the series as a whole.The reason it is so hard for me to rate this show is the simple fact that it has been on so very, very long. 621 episodes and growing, according to the numbers here on IMDb. And when a season lasts that long, it obviously will have stretches of good quality and stretches of bad quality. The Simpsons is no different.Although the series does still make me chuckle here and there, the quality has completely fallen off in the show's later years. It suffered a sudden and terrible decline and I still feel very disappointed watching it, remember and ""missing"" the fantastic episodes of old.Because that's the other extreme. When The Simpsons first went on the air, and for at least 8 seasons (to me, at least), it was one of the very best comedy shows ever produced. The characters were great, the writing was slick, it seemed like every single joke hit its mark and I laughed out loud all the time. It was one of the few ""can't miss"" shows I remember in my life, where Sundays at 8pm I just had to be home to watch it. Everyone talked about it, and regardless of how many seasons you think it lasted everyone considers those early years the ""golden age"" of the Simpsons.I'm not sure if the problem is people leaving, or naturally running out of ideas after being on the air so long, or simple laziness, or the writers and staff getting old, but clearly at a point this show just went from the creative tops to something almost awful.I'm basically averaging it out (6 years of awesomeness, 6 years of being OK, and since then being just bloody awful) to give this show a 5 out of 10. I know I'll be bashed by haters who find my rating too high, and Simpson-heads who can't believe anyone would go lower than 10, but this is the grade I think is fair for this show.","5","13 July 2017"
"29","This was once one of the funniest shows on TV. Now it's just crap. It ceased to be side-splittingly funny during the 1996-1997 season, which opened with a James Bond parody episode that never quite got going, featured the divorce of Milhouse's parents, a painfully unfunny guest voice for Kelsey Grammer's TV brother David Hyde Pierce, and perhaps the only mildly funny bit: the romantic fling between Principal Skinner and Bart's teacher (can't spell her name). Now a days, the show is just one outlandishly ridiculous sight gag stacked on top of another, with no real substance or plot behind it and whatever social satire there may be getting lost in the process. Homer is really blown way out of a proportion as the latter day idiot man trying to exploit the system whenever he can or just act like a lazy bastard. Marge, Bart, and Lisa are just annoying. Some of the supporting characters have their moments but not many.The earlier seasons when the characters were more like real humans were the highpoint of the show.","7","11 August 2004"
"30","It is IMPOSSIBLE to not know about The Simpsons. Love them or hate them, it is also impossible to deny the cultural impact this show has had. This is the greatest TV show ever made for so many reasons:1. It's the longest running sitcom (show?) ever made. 2. They never get old. 3. Millions-yes millions- around the world love them, and it's not hard to see why. 4. You can be 60 and love this show. 5. Did I mention it never gets old? 6. The greatest characters in TV history. 7. Make fun of people that deserve it. Hell, even if they don't.And there are a lot more reasons. It doesn't matter if you're 5,10,15,20,80 years old. This show will make you laugh- at least smile- for an entire episode. While I'll admit the recent seasons have gone downhill, they still make me laugh. But another TV show will NEVER be this popular again.","10","30 May 2006"
"31","This show may have gone downhill significantly over the years, but we have to remember how amazing it once was! After being introduced in animated shorts on ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" in 1987, the Simpson family started out in their own show late in 1989, with a Chrismas special. The first season continued in 1990, and during the show's early days, it was controversial. At that point in time, it seems that society wasn't used to cartoon shows not being 100% kid-friendly. However, ""The Simpsons"" also turned out to be one groundbreaking series of the decade, and the controversy eventually died down (less kid-friendly cartoon shows have come since)!The Simpsons are a dysfunctional American family who live in the city of Springfield. The parents are Homer (an overweight, lazy, aggressive simpleton who works at the local nuclear power plant) and Marge (usually a stay-at-home mother who tries her best to keep the rest of the family in line). The kids are Bart (a ten-year-old boy who very often gets in trouble, and doesn't usually do so well at school), Lisa (a very intelligent, gifted eight-year-old girl who plays the saxophone and usually does very well at school, but often has trouble with her social life), and Maggie (the youngest in the family, only a baby). The family owns two pets, a dog named Santa's Little Helper and a cat named Snowball. Various kinds of trouble for this family often arise, including Marge and Homer having trouble with their relationship, Bart or Lisa experiencing a problem at school, and so many other things! Wherever the Simpsons go, trouble seems to await!The show has many excellent supporting characters, probably more than most shows do! They include Krusty the Clown (a wacky clown whose #1 fan is probably Bart), Mr. Burns (Homer's evil 104-year-old boss at the power plant), Waylon Smithers (Burns' assistant), the Flanders' (the Christian fundamentalist family who live next door to the Simpsons), Seymour Skinner (the principal of Springfield Elementary who is middle-aged and still lives with his mother), Agnes Skinner (Seymour's bossy mother), Apu Nahasapeemapetilon (a man from India who runs the local Kwik-E-Mart), Edna Krabappel (Bart's teacher, who often gives him trouble), Abraham J. ""Grampa"" Simpson (Homer's silly father, who lives at a retirement home and has a lot of history), Patty and Selma Bouvier (Marge's nasty, chain-smoking sisters, who hate Homer), Moe Szyslak (a local bartender who is easily fooled by Bart's crank calls), Barney Gumble (Homer's alcoholic friend who is usually only seen at Moe's), Lenny and Carl (two more of Homer's friends, who drink at Moe's with him and work at the power plant), Milhouse Van Houten (Bart's nerdy friend)...the list goes on! Aside from all the funny characters, ""The Simpsons"" has several other notable features, including lots of brilliant humour, excellent writing, social commentary, a lot of voice talent (most of the cast members provide the voices of several characters), impressive animation (even if the main characters are simply drawn), etc.! The Halloween episodes are a highlight as well, each featuring three short stories, which are generally less realistic than the plots for most regular episodes. There's really not much (if anything) to be said about the long-running, groundbreaking series that hasn't already been said many times, so I'm basically just repeating things that others have mentioned!It has now been nearly eighteen years since ""The Simpsons"" started out in full episodes, and it currently holds the record for the longest-running cartoon show! Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly, it hasn't been the same in recent years, gradually declining in quality. Personally, I can't stand watching new episodes. I certainly don't think they're horrendous, but they seem very stale, and certainly can't compare to the classics, making me feel as if I've lost something in my life. I know I'm certainly not the only fan who avoids new episodes, many others believe that it should have come to an end long ago. However, it's best not to dwell on the negative. What ""The Simpsons"" was in its heyday is not something to be forgotten, and clearly, television in the 1990s wouldn't have been the same without it!","10","31 July 2007"

"34","This show requires two reviews. On one side (season 1-9), we have a show that ranges from good to brilliant and, on the other (season 10+), we have a show that ranges from mediocre to absolutely atrocious.Most of what went wrong has been stated by pretty much everyone who once loved The Simpsons. Today, it is nothing like what it started out as. It's now just a big dumb cartoon for big dumb people. The soul has been ripped out and replaced by a putrid cesspool. The only drive there is at all nowbe it for the writers or for the voice actorsis MONEY. The Simpsons has a multitude of writers (many of them now long gone), so it's little wonder that it has such extremes in quality. Clearly, no-one in charge cares about the show anymore; if they did, it would have ended a long time ago. But let's not blame the cast and crew entirely, because DUMB people are still watching this drivel. Either that or stupidly 'loyal' fanboys being taken for a ride. Still, there is no doubt that, somewhere along the way, a decision was made to appeal to the lowest common denominator, thus targeting a wider demographic, instead of those with a higher intellect. It's tougher to write clever, heart-felt stories than to write childish, directionless crap. That's where we are today.I differ with most people as to when the Simpsons started heading down hill. To me, it was season four. Season four is the first major departure from self contained, logically sound storytelling in favour of mindless slapstick (especially in regards to Homer's transformation from loving dad to crazy moron). Go and watch seasons one to three, and you'll notice that season four is where the main departure took place (although there are some warning signs of what is to come in seasons two and three, such as celebrity appearances and the odd episode with Homer acting like an idiot). I consider seasons one to three to have a 10/10 rating, and seasons four to nine to have an 8/10 rating. The difference to me is that in seasons one to three, the characters act and feel real. The situations are mostly realistic, people are behaving like people, and there is an emotional attachment to the characters. I still enjoy seasons four to nine but, in my opinion, they were heading in the wrong direction. After season nine, the show deteriorates before collapsing entirely. Here are some of the reasons:1. Stories are now predominantly based on slapstick. Suspension of disbelief is impossible to maintain.2. There is no structure to the stories. Episodes have become a vehicle for cheap jokes and predictable set-pieces. The audience is bombarded with them. Stories are no longer about anythingthere is no message.3. Pathetic celebrity appearances that are nothing more than an annoying ego-boosting exercise for those involved. The fact this hasn't abated, despite how obviously BAD it is, tells me a great deal about the people who now run The Simpsons.4. Characters behaving totally abnormally and increasingly ridiculous. This is most noticeable with Homer, but occurs across the board. For example, Lisa is now a mouthpiece for the Left, and Chief Wiggum is the most ridiculous cop on earth.5. Humour is no longer clever or based around a story; it's all just lame and chaotic.6. All flash and no substance. Even the perfect intro has been replaced with a bloated monstrosity that illustrates perfectly where the problems lie: Flash and no substance, quantity and not quality, clean and lifeless animation (also less unique frames).7. No direction or goal. Most ideas have already been realized.8. Stories are no longer character driven.It's disheartening to know that when The Simpsons finally ends, it will bring with it a huge sigh of relief, rather than sadness. Who would have thought that would be the case in the early '90s?","1","5 November 2015"

"36","Animated Film or ""Cartoons' have long been part of the motion world. Their magical movement and ""life"" has been the instrument of so much laughter, tears and all round amazement, tons of it. From HUMOROUS PHASES OF FUNNY FACES (Vitagraph Co., 1906) right down through the heyday of ROGER RABBIT(1988) and beyond, the animated film has been there providing us with an alternate film Universe; another dream world for other dreams.For the longest time, the animated ""Cartoon"" has been branded by some as being strictly (non-greasy) ""Kids' Stuff."" That rap's being hung on them doubtless dates from the early days of commercial Telecasts in the late 1940's and early 1950's, when so many local Stations broadcast Noontime, late Afternoon and Saturday Morning programming aimed at Children. Beyond their assortment of various ""Aunts"", ""Uncles"", Cowboys, Clowns and Puppets of varying ilk; they had to fill out their on air time. But with what would they do, what could be used to fill up the shows? As a diversion from the live action, the Stations made use of what ever short films that could be purchased, rented or leased for a price within their budgets. The films available fell into 2 basic types. The first group featured the likes of Snub Pollard, Harry Langdon, Our Gang, Mickey (Himself) McGuire, The 3 Tons of Fun Harry Langdon, the Keystone Kops and Charlie Chase. These were live action silent comedies.The second group was made up of old silent and early sound animated short subjects. Their sources were many and varied. There were silent with sound track added; containing music, sound effects and occasional words. Paul Terry's Farmer Al Falfa was much in evidence; as were productions of the then defunct Van Beueren Studios. Those cartoons were those featuring ""Cubby Bear"" and ""a human Mutt and Jeff team of ""Tom And Jerry"", not the MGM Cat & Mouse team. And of course, there were many others; a lot of them released to Television by 'Official Films' (as opposed to any Un-Official Films that may be lying about.) Eventually of course, in God's good time, original TV Cartoons were produced. Those such as Alexander Anderson & Jay Ward's CRUSADER RABBIT. Hanna-Barbera's RUFF & REDDY, HUCKLEBERRY HOUND, YOGI BEAR, etc. and Terrytoons' TOM TERRIFIC, DEPUTY DAWG and others did make it out to our living rooms via the Networks. These were mainly done for the kids. (Although, once again, any Jay Ward Production has an appeal to all ages.) And that brings us down the Video Evolutionary Track to THE SIMPSONS. Now, even though animated, even the most vehemently anti-cartoon old grouch would have to concede the point to us that this is not just child's fare.In short, THE SIMPSONS is the story of a totally dysfunctional American Family; being representative of the typical family. The 5 Simpsons are the Homer (father), Marge (Mother), Bart (Son & Star), Lisa (Sister) and Maggie (Infant Sister). Together with their various and sundry pets, neighbors, friends and co-workers have an incredibly high number of adventures, which can be and are limitless in scope and locale. From week to week it isn't uncommon to see either Homer or Marge taking to a new profession or running for public office. Their home town of Springfield has an everyman's geological set up; being bordered by mountains, forests, desserts, rivers, canyons and whatever else the particular story requires. In short, it is boundless and all encompassing. It is a town that is as vast or as deep as imagination, itself.There are some who criticize the characterization of Homer as an uncouth, swill slugging vulgarian. Their line of reasoning being that a poor example of American Family and an even poorer example of a fictional Father figure than was Carroll O'Connor's 'Archie Bunker.' To those critics, we can only say that they should take time and carefully watch and even more meticulously listen to the damn thing! Even though it may appear on the surface that the admittedly dysfunctional (to say the least) family would be a poor example to put on exhibit, albeit a comic version of one.If one stops to take inventory of the individual episodes, their themes and presentations, they'd certainly see things far differently. For believe it or not, the Simpsons present us with a fine example of an American Family, as viewed through the multi lensed spectrum Of a comedy series that, even though it's a ""Cartoon"", has a lot to say. For underneath it all, with all the gags, funny business and wacky plots; we find some very decent, ""old fashioned"" and important virtues that we would do well in remembering.As just one example, an important one is the down to earth relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Simpson, Marge and Homer. No matter how wacky the plot or how far aground the story takes the Family Simpson, in the end we see how much they really do love each other and are always there when their mate needs the other.Honest folks, just try it for yourselves, soon!","10","2 January 2008"

"38","I think I know exactly what the majority of the people reading this interview are saying- ""5/10?? What the hell is going on here?! Has this guy lost his mind???!!"" I admit, it was quite a difficult rating to give, and not one that I imagine will go down particularly well. But the unfortunate fact about this review is that I can't just look at the show's ""Golden Age"" when it was widely considered to be one of the funniest television shows ever created, cartoon or otherwise. Nor can I talk about the almost inconceivable plummet in the show's standards over the past five or so years, though God knows I could talk about that for hours. I have to look at the whole series, from the very beginning to where we are now, and take the whole of The Simpsons into account, from the ingenious hilarity of the past to the staggeringly awful quality we have today.First off, I should make it abundantly clear that to me, The Simpsons, from season one right up until season ten, was one of the funniest television shows ever to air, past, present and I strongly believe future. Creator Matt Groening, together with Sam Simon and James L. Brooks, should be very proud of the work they achieved with them. These seasons are simply incredibly, painfully, blood vessel-burstingly hilarious. Blessed with an incredibly talented and naturally comedic cast, nearly all of whom have stayed committed to the show since its beginning, it has been host to a huge amount of characters who are all brilliantly funny in their own unique, very original way. The jokes range from silly slapstick, all the way through to sharply satirical, and everything in between, and they are nothing short of fantastic. The sheer amount of hilarious quotes and one-liners The Simpsons has in these seasons is nearly unfathomable, and it's not mystery as to why people all over the world can quote them so easily. Truly, they have set the bar for not only television comedy, but comedy on a whole.As well as this though, it never lost sight of the three-dimension of its characters. What makes it great is that we feel for all of them, and watching it, it never feels as though we're watching a cartoon comedy, because it engrosses us in the stories of the people in it, and because there really is so much depth to the characters and the stories that concern them as well as excellent comedy that they almost feel like real people. This of course is especially in the case of the Simpson family themselves, all of whom are excellent characters in these seasons, who have real emotional reactions and feelings, which makes their short-comings all the more relatable. The ability of the cast to convey these emotions as well as the comedy is remarkable, and has led to some truly touching and poignant moments over the seasons.Once we move past the end of the tenth season, there is a definite drop in the quality of the show, though not a drastic one. The jokes are a little less funny, the characters somewhat wasted, and the stories aren't quite as intelligent and enjoyable as they used to be, however it is still excellent television and extremely funny. The cast are still as inspired as they always were, and despite the tragic loss of Phil Hartman by this time, which saw the loss of two excellent characters Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz among others, they are still displaying immense talent and understanding of an astronomical amount of characters.Now, we come to the problem. The reason for the 5/10 rating. A truly heart-breaking moment in television history, because once we reach the fifteenth season, we see the standard of The Simpsons has dived. And it has dived pretty deeply. From this point of the show to where it is today, it's as if we are seeing a different show. The stories are moronic, the jokes are cringingly awful, exchanging intelligence and wit for silliness and humourless exclamations, and the characters are mutilated. The fact the animation has improved only emphasises the change, and all the guest-stars and guest writers in the world can't salvage this shipwreck.The awful jokes and lack of good stories are bad enough, but the worst problem with The Simpsons today, is that the characters have been ruined. All of them were once three-dimensional, interesting and real, but they are all now nothing but background pictures, opportunities for jokes. And bad ones at that. My answer to the question that everyone asks about The Simpsons is my favourite character (other than Homer) is Sideshow Bob, but even one as hilarious as him can't seem to manage one good joke. The worst offence is of course ruining the Simpsons themselves. It started early on with Marge, who was given terrible jokes and pointless stories, and now has even spread to Maggie, who is also stuck with uninteresting, unfunny stories.I don't fully understand how people can stop being funny. It doesn't sound like something that can just happen, but that is exactly what has happened to the writers of The Simpsons. The show that was once ground-breaking and ingenious is now pathetic, a tired old dog limping to the grave that it should have reached years ago. I may sound bitter, and in truth I am, because this was a truly spectacular, one-of-a-kind show, and now it will not be allowed to be put to rest. I love the Simpsons. I love the characters, I love the cast's performances and I love the stories. But that was quite a long time ago, when it deserved it. When it does eventually end, I will of course be extremely sad, but I will be more relieved that finally this great television programme can call it a day at last.","5","26 February 2013"

Damn that was one catchy paragraph I should be a tabloid movie reviewer.Anyways The Simpsons has been around as long as I have, literally, as a TV show. It was probably on Tracey Ullman before I was born. It's probably the first cartoon I remember. I thought it was called The Simp Simps and that they all had tall blue hair like Marge. It was by far my favourite show for nearly a decade oh, and those were during its brilliant golden age, seven or eight tremendous seasons with hardly a slow or tone down episode in the bunch.I discovered this last later in life, when I was around 19 and got back into watching all of the old Simpsons episodes online. It was designed for families; the kids could relate with Bart and Lisa and the wonderful cast bullies and dorks, and there was plenty of moral and tongue and cheek jokes about society, culture, sexuality with a host of guest stars introduced brilliantly.Is a shame what's happened to this show. I went from loving it to hating it, to loving it again and it's always been there. I know this is probably one of Fox's me and shows, but I don't think they rely on it quite the way they used to. Seth MacFarlane from family guy has three of his own shows all animated on there and there are other family-based sitcoms as well now. It's hard to imagine a world without Simpsons, and if they were to have killed it off oh, I would have liked them to have done it probably 20 years ago or so. The Simpsons is an inevitability.I doubt it will truly ever even come close to having the impact what are the sharp wit of its Glory days.it's a shame really, tragic and almost a parody of itself that is still on the ear, and that's a 22 minutes they put out every week while in the season or a parody showing empty shells of the once amazing characters that walk within the fictional world of Springfield. Due to those days, I will not begrudge it its existence. It's an institution oh, and I guess it's being paid its due respect by the fact it's still on the air, if not competing with, cooperating with about a thousand imitators and competitors.","3","27 April 2020"
"40","As a boy I fully loved the series until the thirteenth season, after that, even with the permissiveness of youth, something in the Simpsons began to feel broken. After the film, which did not fully repay the human resources involved, there was a slight and not lasting improvement, but the show never returned to what it was before, for the simple fact that The Simpsons had already said everything. It was possible to try to age the three children of Homer and Marge, but the merchandising was too appetizing and they preferred to continue whipping a dying horse. Over time, the pupil ""Family Guy"" began to be copied, the fututistic flashbacks no longer coincided, Homer became more stupid, the parents' adolescence was moved from the 70's to the 90's, more modern technologies began to appear, there were more VIPs cameos and many classic characters were flandered.No show can remain memorable with such a venerable age, but they haven't seriously tried and that's what bothers most. Why not create new iconic Springfield citizens, especially considering that some of them disappear along with their voice actors over the years? Why not make more use of the secondary historical characters, who have only recently had some episodes? Why waste some of Lisa and Bart's love interests when a couple of them might have potential as recurring characters (Cletus's daughter, the cool ecologist, the bipolar girl, etc.) ? Why be so Homercentric?Reviewing with the adult eyes the first ten seasons, I gained an even more severe opinion. I certainly reevaluated the episode with Frank Grimes, which I once thought was too cruel without a real purpose, however, contrary to many fans who refer to the ninth season as that of the fall of quality for the infamous Skinner episode, I think it is also the case to discard the octave from the really good seasons. The writing in both seasons was still better than it would be in the future, but already the eighth was too experimental. Personally I think the Simpsons are dead after the great seventh season and ironically my rating reflects the same number. If I had to evaluate the series in its entirety, giving 6 stars would already be extremely generous, but we can't ignore the golden age, and what the Simpsons fever represented for us in the 90s.","7","21 May 2021"
"41","It seems that animation budget grows every season, but the characters literally die. The plot has become so insipid and secondary that it is almost impossible to watch. Of course, it is difficult to keep the bar after so many years, but The Simpsons does not stand up to criticism, both with the old seasons and with other shows, of which there are so many.Disenchantment build a strong characters that was developing on our eyes; Rick and morty masterpiece ridicule the political and social defects of different systems; even the dirty family guy is not afraid to point out the obvious flaws of modern social fashion. The Simpsons have slipped into disgrace for me.At least we have first great seasons.","5","2 May 2021"
"42","When it comes to TV shows today, you think of crud that people call 'entertainment' like American Idol and others. And you also have shows where people try to be funny and entertaining, but alas there not (which the directors never seem to realize), examples include Hannah Montana and a lot more. But 'The SImpsons' keeps it entertaining it won't make you scream ""We seen the same plot line for an episode fifteen times on this dang show!"" The characters (despite being hundreds of them) all have a personality and soul, and Matt Groening keeps everything at an excellent pace. And the character voices are superb. And the humor, ninety-six percent of the time (""IF HE WANTS TO HAVE A NOISE COMPETITION WE'LL TURN ON MY CIRCUS FIRE CD!""), never fails. 'The Simpsons' is one of televisions greatest shows, and should never, ever be forgotten.","9","11 May 2007"
"43","I have to start off by saying that seasons 1-9 of the Simpsons were absolutely fantastic, easily some of the best television i have ever seen. the writing was sharp and witty, the characters unpredictable and to some degree you could relate to them. I don't think anyone can deny that the Simpsons is probably the most famous TV show ever. even people who don't watch the show have heard about it or can name a few of the characters whether it be Homer, Bart or Marge, THAT IS HOW POWERFUL THIS SHOW HAS BECOME. After all the success of the TV show it was inevitable that eventually a movie would be made, but to talk about the movie would be starting a completely different review all together, so i won't get into that.Now you might have wondering why i have got ""Awkward feelings"" as my summary, well thats exactly what i get when i watch the more recent episodes. i feel awkward and pretty upset to be honest, at just how bad the newer episodes are. they are over the top, pointless and predictable. in the first 9 seasons each episode had a subtle moral whether it be about stealing , drugs or other things, but when watching the latest ones i just get the feeling they make them just for the money factor, without actually giving a Sh*t about how they are ruining the memories most hardcore fans have of when the show was the best thing on television. It has gone on far too long , and i know i am in the majority when i say that this show is slowly starting to leave a bad taste in mouths of the fans. They should just end the show now whilst its still ""decent"" , in the 400+ episodes that exist, you would think they have told all the stories they wanted about the family, but no they keep coming up with stupid stories that make no sense, which we have already seen similar ones to in the older episodes.As much as i cannot stand the last 5 or six seasons , ill still have to give this show 10/10 , because of the first 9 or so seasons, That is how highly i think of them.By Scott Dewhurst","10","25 November 2010"
"44","It is no longer possible for me to imagine a world without The Simpsons in it. I was ten years old when I saw my first episode (I was living in Germany by the time, so it was dubbed) but I was hooked on the show ever since. It started to grow on me, and I haven't missed an episode in ten years. Every day I tune in and even manage to stand the lousy commercials in between, only because I know that there's a good time coming. Sure, there are a few lesser episodes, especially in the last two series, but that only encourages me to watch the old ones over and over again. I'll probably never stop watching !","10","2 December 1999"
"45","The Simpsons is entertaining but the show has not evolved over the last 20 seasons. There is a sameness to it which some might find comforting but after watching the first 10 seasons on and off, there's no point in watching new episodes anymore, nor watching re-runs.","6","25 January 2021"
"46","The Simpsons is an animated American sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. It is a satirical parody of the ""Middle American"" lifestyle epitomised by its title family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield, and lampoons many aspects of the human condition, as well as American culture, society as a whole, and television itself.The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening sketched an outline version of a dysfunctional family, and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show.The Simpsons was an early hit for Fox, and won several major awards. Time magazine's December 31, 1999 issue named it the 20th century's best television series, and on January 14, 2000 it was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The Simpsons is currently the longest-running American sitcom, and the longest-running American animated program. Homer's annoyed grunt ""D'oh!"" has been adopted into the English lexicon, while The Simpsons has been cited as an influence on many adult-oriented animated sitcoms.","10","4 July 2007"

"48","I have not, and do not intend to watch the blasphemous new seasons. Early Simpsons is peak television. I didn't get to enjoy them or understand until I was in my 20's but good god this is top tier humor, not throwaway dirty jokes (unless necessary).","8","18 February 2021"
"49","From 1989 through the early 2000s I would never leave the house on a Sunday evening without setting the VCR to record the brilliant, scathingly funny ""The Simpsons.""Then, after more than a decade of devoted watching, things started to sag. My interest began to wane, but the quality of the scripts took a dive off of Springfield's highest tower (or nuclear reactor).For the last few years, I only tuned in if I was at home and there was nothing else going on. And still the scripts got increasingly worse, the humor bland - if there was any - and I noticed a distinct drop in the enthusiasm of the actors.After skipping two or three years, I got through the first five episodes of Season 29 and quit. I had given a rating of 1 star to each of those episodes and vowed to never watch again (and I didn't).But now, after media headlines trumpeting a wonderful return for Season 30, I watched the season premiere. I was appalled. Not one single second of humour, not even enough to crack a smile, and still the same attempts at reviving jokes that may have worked in 1989. Absolutely pitiful. I gave my score of 1 star and now I swear I shall not return to Springfield.You would have thought enough TV execs would have learned this by now, but you need to quit while you're ahead.The Simpsons"" should have taken its final bow, graceful and with heaps of topical, gross humour, many years ago, but it far, far overstayed its welcome, and it greatly disappoints me to reduce my score of the series to 1 star.","1","2 October 2018"
"50","I started watching The Simpson's when it first started. The then Bart-centric show was a cultural phenomenon which simply had to be watched week in and week out. Later, when Homer took the lead, it remained a weekly destination for some deep belly laughs. However, over the past ten years, I've mostly been watching The Simpson's out of habit. It seemed to have lost something, but I continued to persevere and give it the benefit of the doubt. Last week, Treehouse of Terror XXII, finally convinced me this show no longer held anything for me other than a history. The Halloween episodes are usually highpoints, but this last one was simply too flat to hold my interest.Naturally, this bummed me out. Hey, sue me, but I'm not too eager to let go of a show that's been a part of my life since before I was old enough to buy my own clothes. This got me to thinking over what was wrong with this series. Boy, was the list a long one. However, the numerous items all had one common feature. It turned out what had formerly been the Simpson's greatest strength had become its greatest weakness. This would be the Simpson family.Over the show's twenty-three seasons and 489 episodes, there's simply nothing left to say or do with the leads. Homer is borderline mentally handicapped and sociopathic. Marge is his faithful, endlessly suffering wife. Lisa is socially conscious and an insufferable know-it-all. Bart is an ever gleeful rabble-rouser. Maggie is a BAMF infant who has a tendency to bail her family out of some pretty tough spots. Every possible storyline and permutation has been explored with them in triplicate. In short, there's nothing left for these characters to tell their audience.In all honesty, it's been this way for a while. Yet, I kept watching. If the main characters had all run their course, what could possibly have been left? Then it hit me. Yes, the Simpson's have long since passed their expiration date. However, they just happen to live in Springfield, which has more pop culture icons per capita than Metropolis, Gotham City or even Marvel's NYC.There are dozens of laugh-out-loud characters who've been hammered into the collective conscious of the viewing public. From The Android's Dungeon, to Springfield Elementary, to the nuclear power plant, to the Quickee Mart and more, Springfield is rife with character's who deliver the funny. Sadly, the Simpson's tend to hog the spotlight.Since my favorite parts of the show have more and more frequently featured the supporting characters and less and less Homer and co., I had an idea as to what could save this property. FOX should cancel The Simpson's? Uh, no. FOX should retool The Simpson's so the emphasis would be more on Springfield and less on 742 Evergreen Terrace? Abso-flippin-lutely.Bart has been explored to his fullest. But Jimbo, Sherri and Terri, Lunchlady Doris and Ms. Hoover have largely remained untouched. We know how much of a jerk Homer is. Well what about Moe, Barney, Lenny, Carl, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Smithers. For that matter, what about the Comic Book Guy, Apu, the Van Houten's, Crazy Cat Lady, the Texan, Bumble Bee Man, the Ship Captain, Otto, the Wiggums, Fat Tony, those at Springfield Retirement Castle and so many others? There are easily thirty gut busting characters here who could more than hold an episode or two where they were the central character. Hell, Mr. Burns alone could carry an entire season. Don't even get me started on Chief Wiggums and the SPD.I say from this point on out, Groening and company should embrace this approach to this franchise. Just stop calling it The Simpson's and, instead, call it Springfield or maybe A Town Called Springfield. Take the spotlight off the Simpson's and shine it on this Emmy winning supporting cast. But that's not all.One major problem I've had with The Simpson's is each episode tends to end with a reset to the beginning. Nothing is ever changed or carried over, save for the death of Maude Flanders. I don't think it would hurt to have a few events occur which set a loose timeline. Maybe there could be a few story lines which stretch over more than one episode (a la Who Shot Mr. Burns?). I don't want to see characters get older and grow up, which would ruin the series. But I sure wouldn't mind seeing them retain at least some knowledge of what's been going on and maybe applying it in some manner.If Groening as well as the cast and crew of The Simpson's were to roll up their sleeves and pull this off, it would add at least another ten years of quality entertainment to FOX that doesn't involve singing or dancing. How freaking cool would that be? It would be very cool indeed, if I say so myself. Unfortunately, unrealized potential and $1.50 will only get you a ham sandwich. So as The Simpson's are now, I can only award it 6/10.","6","6 November 2011"
"51","The Simpsons was a wonderful show. In its heyday in the 90s, it was probably the best show on TV. To call it a defining show of the 90s is an understatement. The Simpsons is probably one of the most obvious examples of 90s pop culture. The show has the distinction of being the one with the most guest appearances. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine TV without The Simpsons. However, the show has been dead for the last ten years. It started to decline, appropriately enough, at the end of the 90s. Here are the reasons for its decline.1) It tried to be like South Park and Family Guy. The Simpsons was a novelty for many years. It was a prime time cartoon. However, in 1997 South Park premiered. This was a cartoon that used violence and profanity for shock value. In 1999, Family Guy premiered and was also much racier. In 1999, The Simpsons began experimenting with this on their shows. This was never a staple of them before.2) The character of Maude Flanders was killed. She was a major character that was killed off about 1999 or 2000. Having her die completely changed the tone of the show and especially the Flanders family, who are major characters.3) Plots became wacky. The original charm of the show was the fact that it was somewhat realistic. The show soon started having ridiculous plots like Homer and Ned marrying floozies in Las Vegas.4) Phil Hartman died. The loss of Phil Hartman was devastating to the show. His characters provided much depth into the show and interesting plots.The Simpsons was a great show and it is sad to see it go downhill so much.","3","30 January 2010"

"53","Of course I'm referring to the first 10 seasons (8-3 more specifically) but I prefer to rate a show from its prime other than the rotting corpse it is now
The simpsons is pure genius and it's hard to tell why. When you look into the jokes you can see there is deeper way to why it makes you laugh. This is something lacking in the later seasons.
Everyone knows the simpsons but a lot of people don't recognise it as the masterpiece it is. If it wasn't then why do we see the residents of Springfield as if we personally knew them?
In the earlier seasons it would be damn rare to find a weak episode, similar to Rick and Morty every episode had something to like","10","31 May 2019"
"54","Now this is the first review I have done that I have not put a rating down for but that is because I have different opinions on all the seasons.Season 1: I watched this and I did not think it would be very good seeings as a lot of shows like this have failed sometime along the way and then I saw it, It was by no means great but it was a humorous way to escape life for half an hour. This is what become the best show in the world so I rate it 73%Season 2: This was pretty funny and was on the verge of hilarious but it still was not the ensured hilarity of later seasons but it kept me watching and waiting for more. I rate this season 77%.Season's 3-5: This was up in the top shows of the 20th century now, it was getting better and better as episodes got funnier and clevier, still I did not think it would get any better then this even though it was probably in the top 10 shows ever by now. I rate these 3 seasons together as 85%.Season's 6-9: This is where it became the best show in the world and I am not exaggerating it took over as the smartest funniest show I have ever seen, it also got a way bigger audience by then and there was merchandise galore going around by then, I rate these season's 97%.Season 10: For the first half of the season this was the same classic Simpsons that we all knew and loved from seasons 6-9 as it was again to use the phrase it was clever and funny but in the second half we saw something different, we saw different types of Simpson's like spin off's more spoofs and more humour based around the stupidness of Springfieldians but this was not necessarily a bad thing as it led to brilliant episodes of Homer doing what he does best Bart being more of a vigilant and Lisa being a nerd but still after this we never got the old Simpsons back even though newer seasons are not bad either. I rate the first half of this season 89% and the second half 82%.Season 11: In this season we saw interesting plots which were probably more funny then clever but still was extremely witty for a show that had lasted so long, and with such episode like ""Brothers Little Helper"" and ""behind the laughter"" the show was kept alive by Matt Groening's genius. I rate this season 79%.Season's 12-13: These seasons had OK plots and extremely funny jokes, the show as still quite humorous and I was still watching it weekly and was quite mad if I missed an episode. I at this point thought the Simpson's was still the best show. I rate this seasons 79%. Kinda like Season 10 really.Season 14: Well by now the Simpson's were in that stage of all the episodes were of the characters being changed temporarily to fill in time. But still the show was good enough for me to continue watching it with joy and the show still had a while left before it died to me. That is why I rate this season 79%.Season 15-17: This seasons to me were pretty good and great episodes made up for some that were not as good (not saying any are awful)this seasons kept the show with a burning light to me and still I wanted to watch more and more of this great show. I rate these season's 82%.Season 18: I did not like this season very much and it was only good for a few laughs every few episodes. I will rate it 71% because I feel generous.Season 19: Best since Season 9, absolutely hilarious. I think all haters of what the show has become should watch Season 19 as it is very very clever. I rate this season 91%.Overall: 81.36%From a Simpson's fan.","10","9 January 2008"
"55","SPOILERSThe Simspons may just be the greatest show on the planet. It is about a family in the town of Springfield. There are a lot of stereotypes in the show including Moe, the suicidal bartender, Barney, the burping alcoholic, Mr.Burns, the 104 year-old multi-millionaire, Wiggum, the worst cop ever, and Hibbert, the laughing doctor. Their rival town is Shelbyville. The Simspons' neighbors are the religious Flanders, including Rod and Tod, the two kids, Ned, the dad, and the late Maude Flanders, who died in a episode. There is absolutely no reason you should miss this show. A must-see animated comedy series, and very realistic.10/10!Recommended titles: Family Guy","10","22 August 2006"
"56","When The Simpson's first aired it quickly gained an enthusiastic audience. It was fresh, witty and objectively satirical. Sadly, today, The Simpson's looks to me a lot a tired conduit for stale, conservative musings. Luddites who fear even positive change and want time to stand still, so they can be content in their personal little bubbles. For me, this is evinced by peculiar and inexplicably nasty critiques of, for example, Elon Musk. Musk a clever and benevolent inventor, suffered, if my memory serves me, a three episode long, rather harsh, critique. Just plain weird. Its a shame to see The Simpson's sink beneath the surface of both satirical common sense and entertainment. Maybe its time for Homer and Marge to retire, Bart, Lisa and Maggie to finally grow up and leave the nest. Five out of ten from me (and only because I fondly remember what a wonderful series this used to be).","5","21 November 2015"

On the other hand, you have your comedy. Of course, the comedy and the Simpsons comedy is favored among more. Why is the comedy material funny? Randomness. The Simpsons is very random and that's what sets it apart drastically from the others such as Futurama and King of the Hill.

"65","I've been watching this animated sitcom for a long time and it's excellent. The best things about The Simpsons are the unforgettable story lines, various blackboard and couch gags during the opening sequence, the catchphrases (including Homer's, ""D'oh!"") and references to other plays, films and TV shows.My favourite characters are Bart and Lisa. Bart is a naughty but hilarious prankster while Lisa's a genius. Some of my favourite episodes are Trilogy of Error, The Regina Monologues, Bart Gets Famous, Bart Gets an Elephant, Barting Over, Duffless, Radio Bart and Flaming Moes. The episode featuring Praiseland is also worth watching as well as Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife that was written by Ricky Gervais of The Office fame.The Simpsons is one of my most watched TV programmes during my teens.

Burns,Milhouse,Smithers,Barney and Krusty and it also has gotten more than 400 episodes and with all the things that can happen around Springfield and a tree house of horror every season it will never run out of ideas,the Simpsons is without a doubt my favourite show and I give it a deserved 10/10.","10","1 April 2010"
"70","""The Simpsons"" are no longer the great series I used to know, but it is still one of the most important and influential animated series ever made. During the shows golden age (From the early to mid of the nineties) the show was extremely original, not only because it was one of the few animated shows made for an adult audience, but also because of the particular style of it, which was incredibly clever and satirical, with subversive humor made it stand out not only as a television cartoon, but as a comedy. Too bad that for younger people who have spent their adolescent years watching shows like South Park and Family Guy(whose brand of humor is very much derived from The Simpsons) it is probably quite hard to appreciate just how groundbreaking (and hilariously funny) the yellow skinned family and their show were back in their best days.","10","17 June 2010"
"71","... there was a great show, created by a talented man called Matt Groening. The show became on of the biggest shows in the world, popular with old and young. But Matt Groening became corrupt by success, forcing his show to live a half-life and not die a natural, peaceful death.As you can tell, I have similar thoughts about The Simpsons, like most fans of my generation, growing up with the show in its peak in the 90s. The show was successful because it was very funny, combining cleaver humour from culture to politics, parody and satire, small site gags to good slapstick (nothing like Homer hurting himself).The premise of The Simpsons, is simple, it follows one family from a small American city (Springfield), as they struggle through life. All the main members have excellent episodes that allows them to shine. As the show grew with success more characters were created and they too got episodes, from Krusty the Crown, Ralph Wiggun, Sideshow Bob, Mr. Burns, Smithers, etc... The show also looked at themes from the media, childhood issues, health, American society, and so fore. Everyone has favourite characters in the show, my are Homer, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Mr. Burns and Sideshow Bob.When the Simpsons was at it best it was one of my favourite shows and I watched it constantly. I still do watch, having a number of series on DVD, and watch the random selection on television. But by 1997/1998, the quality of the Simpsons started to decline, with the episode 'The Principal and the Pauper' being the Jumping of the Shark moment, and the ninth series being the last good series. There are good episodes after that series, but their come fewer and far between. There are good jokes, like how Homer would enter and leave the world in 'Half-Decent Proposal', but again become fewer.So why did the Simpsons decline? There are a number of reasons. Most of the good writers like David X. Cohen left the show or like John Swartzwelder who take a less active role. The writers are no where near their quality. The writers turn away from character driven episodes to more wacky adventure based ones which ruined the show, or the writers simply ran out of ideas, and did episodes based on famous stories like Hamlet, Lewis and Carl, Henry VIII, etc... Halloween episodes also had little to do with Halloween, being based on action films like Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Transformers rather then horror like The Shinning and the Twilight Zone. The Simpsons became more focused on the stars their could get to be guest voices for the show, instead of who would be good for the cast. Finally, they is the American system of programme making, which is if a show is popular keep running it until the rating go down. Compare to the British style which is let the show run for a few series, like Fawalty Towers and Blackadder and let it end when it good.When the Simpsons was at it best, i.e. the 90s period, it was one of the best shows ever made, and easily a 10/10. But slowly the show became weaker, but because I am a fair person I give a 8/10 because of the happy memories it gives me.","8","7 October 2009"
"72","This show was amazing! Use to be so good, funny and witty and had some of the best characters. I don't know how,maybe it was because the movie came out but It went way down hill. I always hope the new episodes will be funny but they're just getting pathetic. I gave up hope on any new episodes being good, they're probably going to end it soon which would be a good thing. I don't know who writes for this show now, but whoever does they're terrible. For soo long this show was a ten, even more than that! And now it has gone form a ten to a three. Oh well..If you want to watch something funny, I say watch South Park, still funny and haven't gone downhill (Yet).","3","27 June 2011"
"73","I'd give a higher rating, but The Simpsons's died long time ago and should have ended when it had some dignity left. Now every episode seems like the same.That said The Simpsons was solid stuff years ago. It was funny, touching and thought provoking. Best episode that comes to mind must be Bart gets an F (I hope that is the real name or this is really embarrassing).","7","1 April 2017"
"74","I give the Simpsons kudos for breaking the ground for other adult cartoon comedy shows like South Park and Family Guy but at this point thats all the Simpsons were good for. The show is running as long as Gunsmoke and I remember Gunsmoke in it's trailing years and how I would never watch such an old folks show. Well, that has got to be the way many young people must feel about this show because it's been around since before they were born! To recap what this show is about, ALL rich people are extremely bad and evil, all Republicans are extremely bad and evil, all middle class whites are idiots, all Christians are either unfaithful or boring, all blacks are pillars of society, all Asians are quacks, all Indians work at 7/11, leave the Muslims and Jews alone but make fun of Hindus and Christians and probably others like the Amish, and if you want to be anything in life you need to be a liberal, I have no idea about Gays since they kind of stay away from them but I'm sure when they do talk about them it's in a good way, the only thing I have not heard on this show is reality like abortion, when is Lisa going to get knocked up? I mean at this point it is hopeless liberal propaganda and if it's still funny the jokes must have been played out as much as the Road Runner and boulders falling on Wile E Coyote for me because after over 20 years of beating up middle class white America that joke is extremely unfunny. Any questions? 1 star out of 10, it's still a cash machine though so expect this show to go on forever as America has nothing else to watch Sunday nights I guess.","1","25 February 2013"
"75","Not only is The Simpsons the best TV show ever made, it is also one of american historys most important political forums. Groening and his co-creators have never been backstroking anyone and certainly never kissed any ass. They show us a society beyond salvation and we are laughing our brains out! Can you possibly do anything greater for mankind than that ?!","9","15 October 2001"
"76","I remember first sitting down to watch the Simpsons when it came to Australia. I was about 12 or 13. Hooked from the get-go, I have been a devoted fan ever since. It's true the latest seasons haven't been nearly as bust-a-gut funny as the earlier ones, but there's enough humour and social commentary to keep me hanging on and eagerly awaiting that new episode each week. The Simpsons has become such an integral part of my life that I think I have a Simpsons quote for every situation I find myself in, and more than once I've found myself thinking, ""what would Homer do?"" The DVD sets are great, packing in the extras to breaking point. The commentaries are especially great, often almost as funny as the episodes themselves. But I have to say, the packaging for Season 11 is AWFUL. What were they thinking? Not only are the four DVDs in tight, coarse little cardboard sleeves, there are glue spots sticking them together right in line with where you pull the disc out! What the hell? Be very cautious pulling the DVDs out for the first time. I've actually abandoned the cover and put the discs in their own jewel cases to avoid scratching them in future. As Comic Book Guy would say: ""Worst...packaging...ever.""","10","6 November 2008"
"77","I've been watching The Simpsons probably since it first started here in Finland. It was in the beginning of the 90s. Of course back then I didn't understand anything about it, but it was nice to watch moving pictures even though I couldn't read or understand English at the time. But about 10 years later I started following The Simpsons very intensively. And now few years after that I can say The Simpsons is one the greatest TV shows ever. There won't ever be something like The Simpsons.The Simpsons is almost only American comedy show that I watch. I just don't like the American humor, it really isn't funny. It's pretty much just idiotic-not-funny-boring-stupid... Well you got the idea. And what about the American pre-laughing system? Hah! Is there anything that underestimates the viewer so much? Probably not.But The Simpsons is different: it's satiric, witty, funny, satiric, witty, funny, satiric, witty and funny. And funny. And it's not pre-laughed! And there's absolutely not a single bit of that usual stupid American humor. ...And those are the things that makes The Simpsons perfect (TV) comedy. The Simpsons and of course South Park are probably the only American comedy series that are actually funny (and satiric). You guys really should make more TV series like The Simpsons and South Park.In Homer we trust.","10","6 June 2006"
"78","This is one great comedy, and the funny thing about it is ""It's a cartoon"". The simpsons shows people the cartoons can be for adults as well as children.

"79","Out of every cartoon, Movie, play, and T.v show I've ever seen The Simpsons tops it all. the Simpsons is the funniest show Bar None. American Dad, Futurama, and Family guy come in close but in my opinion the Simpsons is better than all of them combined. I have seen every single episode and i own seasons one through five and have Simpsons posters and action figures.i have not found an episode that i did not like., some of my favorites are the valentines episode where Bart puts Homers Beer in the paint shakers, and ""Das Bus"" season 9 ""O' Brother were art Thou?"" season 2. and any episode from the sixteenth season. they have made it to over three hundred episodes and I'm betting on three hundred more. THE SIMPSONS WILL NEVER DIE!",NA,"1 July 2005"
"80","This show could probably have 3 to 4 different ratings depending on the era. This show has spanned 30+ seasons. For me the first 10-11 seasons would be easily a 10. The first couple aren't great, but are still entertaining, season 3 is when it became great. It slowly goes down hill after that, before the bottom drops out. The show needs to end, it's well past its sell by date.So an overall 8 is very generous in my estimation. For someone who has never seen it, stick to seasons 3 through 10.","8","26 April 2021"
"81","15 years ago I would have given The Simpsons a 10. I attempted to watch a newer episode a while back and it was awful. The show has become a shell of it's original glory. From it's poor storylines and lazy writing, this show is the epitome of what ""jump the shark"" means...even more so than the ACTUAL Happy Days jump the shark.And it's really a shame, because it used to be my favorite show. At least I have the earlier episodes to remind me how great it once was.","8","10 January 2021"
"82","If you're one of the many here that frequent ""The Simpsons"" message board,you might wonder why I am bothering with a review of the show at this particular time.It's not because the movie just came out or that they've surpassed 400 episodes. It's not even that if they broadcast 36 more shows they'll top ""The Adventures Of Ozzie and Harriet"" as the 1/2 hour show with the most episodes (O. & H. had 435 shows-1952-1966).I simply wanted to say that,since the time I finally tuned in for the episode where Marge & Homer tell their kids about how they met,as well as their 1974 prom night,I have been an almost consistent viewer. I wont call myself a ""fan"" because I've never liked that term applied to myself. I do love the show though and plan to tune in right up to the finish.When it debuted with the Dec. 17th,1989 special,""Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire"",I didn't even know it was on TV... with the exception of the Tracy Ullman shorts. On Tracy's show I first saw them with ""Family Portrait"",it was funny but weeks later I had forgotten all about it.The great thing to say about the series as a whole entity is it's ability to turn even the simplest of situations into anarchy and craziness and or silliness. Even the best 30 min. sitcoms could never do the kinds of stories and situations done here. Especially episodes about different people in the town. Sitcoms could not afford to pay for that many actors.It seems even the most minor of characters has gotten an episode about them. Makes me wonder if they'll do a show for that pale looking kid with the curly hair! Homer Simpson is the epitome of the American couch potato,who unlike in real life,does extra-ordinary things that the common man only dreams of. Which is the most ironic thing about this simplistic guy with the crayon scratching his brain.Voiced by veteran ""Rhoda"" co-star Julie Kavner(who played Rhoda's sister Brenda),Marge is a woman and mother,in a situation,that,would in real life drive a female to pack up and leave and get a divorce. (Or even check in to an asylum). Homer is as much a handful to her as Bart & Lisa and even when it seems Homer's driven her over the edge,she still stays true to him in the end.Bart has thankfully had many more dimensions added since the first year and the best shows are when he's at his most vulnerable. Like most recently when he sees a psychologist at the school's expense or the show where he goes on outings with his Mother on the bicycle for two.Lisa is possibly the best drawn out character,who seems torn between taking on the realities of the world and just being a normal 8 year old girl. The shows dealing with her & Homer's relationship are the best.My favorite shows are the more relevant touching episodes but don't get me wrong,I love the irreverent humor and crazy antics as well. ""Treehouse of Horror"" is even farther beyond those already crazy episodes in the regular seasons,my favorite of those Halloween outings being ""Homer3"" when Homer ends up in the third dimension behind a living room wall.I don't care what anyone says,despite a slow season or two,The Simpsons still get my vote as a great series and if not for this show we wouldn't have the likes of ""Family Guy"",""King Of The Hill"" or ""American Dad"" on network TV.The Simpsons opened the door to cartoons for grown ups and while I was tentative about it at first,I now say I'm glad The Simpsons came to be.

"83","This really pains me to leave such a low rating... but you have to weigh up the good and bad sides of the show. There are now more BAD episodes than there are GOOD, so you have to give it a rating of under 5.I have watched, and own, every single episode of The Simpsons. These are how they rate:Seasons 1 - 11 = Good to outright the best TV in history
Seasons 12 - 17 = A bit meh, but still watchable
Seasons 18 - 31+ = Downright awful11 years of great; 13 years of god awful; and 5 years of ""could go either way"".Classic Simpsons is still my favourite show of all time. But the bad has overlapped the good for a long time now.","3","10 April 2020"

It's not funny because Tom & Jerry was a good help in the days of WWII. It's completely understandable why The Simpsons was so controversial when it was first coming out.

I know a lot of shows like the SIMPSONS that are canceled, just because they aren't given a chance-especially on FOX.The characters are wonderfl, and the whole cast is voiced by a few people, disguising their voice (Dan Castenella does tons of voices, his most famous HOMER SIMPSON). For example, did you know Bart is voiced by a female? That I find is funny, because he really does act and sound like a little bratty but loveable character.

"88","The Simpsons is without a doubt one of the best shows of all time. I watched them from the very beginning, and by that I mean beck when they were shorts played at commercial time on the Tracy Ullman Show. I said then if that cartoon were ever made into a TV show it would be the funniest thing ever. They did, and it was.If you were to count all the laughs over the last 20 years, you would find that The Simpsons are funnier than Seinfeld. The first stand-alone episode was funny and the last one they made was funny. The laughs just never end. I can watch reruns all day long too. It just never gets old.The Simpsons has such a very rich history too. The characters are well established and the city of Springfield seems to have everything you could want.Of course, my favorite would have to be Homer. He's just so funny and wrong all the time. He's a loud and obnoxious oaf. Don't you just love the word ""oaf""? Well, that's Homer. He'll go to any length to be an idiot.I hope the laughs never end.

"93","What can I say about the Simpsons? Initially, let's start with the positives. Has there ever quite been a show like the Simpsons? I think not! Matt Groening and James L. Brooks have truly created something of great comical and philosophical magnitude. From seasons 1-13 (that's right, up to season 13!), comedy appropriate to the society was cleverly exploited, causing the Simpsons to become a global phenomenon for obvious reasons. Flaws in society were excavated; puns were dished out with a clean edge and, most profoundly, this was a cartoon that both enticed adults and children alike (paving the way for successful cartoons such as Family Guy and South Park; although neither would reach the success of The Simpsons). Now the negatives. From seasons 14-19, Simpsons episodes were mediocre, shamelessly brandishing celebrities left, right and centre and dishing out jokes that seemed force and less natural. The series still did have the spark that peaked interest and tickled the funny bone but, other than that, it was rather a disappointment. This, however, was nothing compared to the decline in quality from seasons 20-26! Story lines seemed to consist of depression in the Simpson household and offered little to no comedic value. In addition, celebrities not only made cameo appearances, but dominated episodes in which the plot was clearly strained and offered nothing (especially the disgusting 'Lisa goes Gaga' which seems to combine all of my points beautifully). The writers have quite literally lost the plot and the show really should be cancelled! It is hard to tell whether the show has become a sentimental attachment to Mr Groening or whether FOX are just too worried about losing money at the cancelling of this show. Whatever the reason, FOX or Matt Groening need to end this show so it can leave the spotlight retaining dignity and fond memories; otherwise, we may look back at the early episodes as a distant memory! I rate The Simpsons as a 10 simply because of its earlier brilliance and my loyalty: a testament to its early episodes!","10","31 March 2015"
"94","The Simpsons was a great show. It was very funny. But as they entered Season 13. It got very old,very fast. They tried everything to get jokes. Which fell flat. They stretched possibility too far. I know this is a cartoon,but the earlier episodes were believable. It is sad that a once funny show is being milked for all its worth. End it! But I know The Simpsons will last forever,and will continue to grow worse. It is sad for me because I used to be a die hard fan.Early episodes 4/4Season 13,and 14 0/4",NA,"7 April 2003"
"95","The Simpsons is probably the smartest show in television. That is if you've only seen the first half seasons of the show. The new seasons are terrible. They stopped being smart and in order to compete with shows that are more aggressive (like South Park) or random (like every show on adult swim) they've destroyed it.When I was a kid the Simpsons payed homage to some of the most brilliant movies, books, music. I learned about Stanley Kubrik, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Beatles, etc. Nowadays they pay homage to Transformers and Lindsay Lohan. I think this is a small example that shows what has happened to them. I hope these people at fox stop producing it. Because the Simpsons were impeccable. But if they continue the legacy will vanish.Like everything great on the planet it is important to know when to call it quits.

"99","The Simpsons, back in the early to mid 90's, was by far the greatest sitcom ever on TV. With strong jokes, humorous parodies, funny slapstick and wonderful plots it swept the nation by storm. For those who don't know, the Simpsons is about an American family called the Simpsons (hence the title) who live in the fictional town of Springfield. The father, Homer, is a beer bellied not so smart guy who works in the local nuclear power plant. His wife, Marge is a doting housewife and mother, and they have three kids, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. This show, back over a decade ago, stood out for two reasons. One, it was an animated sitcom (which was based mostly on reality, fantasy elements shown in typical cartoons appeared briefly) and two, the Simpsons was a dysfunctional family, except the volume was turned way up. Back in the 90's sitcoms involved families who were a strong unit and cared for each other and all that stuff, but the Simpsons were constantly having problems and such, always getting back together in the end, which was the theme of the show and what kept it on top. The prime of the show would be, in my opinion, around 1993-1997 (or the third through the sixth season,) After that, the show began to lose humorous edge, and by the early 2000 period, the show really began to fall apart. It is now 2006, and with even worse episodes being churned out, the show probably should of called it quits by 97 or 98 when it showed signs of age.So what happened? The show is clearly different now then it was ten years ago but there seems to be a lot of little things that made the show go south. I noticed by the 11 or 12th season, the show started to include very ridiculous and crazy plots that would never happen in real life (and every celebrity on the planet would start to appear in every episode, one by one) Now before anybody flames me and says ""It's a cartoon dumbass!"" (I couldn't figure that out, thanks guys!) It is important to understand that in the prime of the show it had plots that were realistic, things that normal people could go through every day (Maybe it would go outside the barriers of reality, but only briefly) You could relate to the characters, and actually cared what happened to them. By the way, celebrates did appear in the past, but they were usually cameos or voiced characters, rather then playing themselves like now. But now that the plots and ideas are so nuts that I don't really care what the resolution will turn out to be. And now the celebrity guest will have a whole episode involving him, which really makes the show boring in my opinion. Another problem with the show is that the jokes simply aren't as funny or interesting anymore, and that is what really is hurting the show. The writers try hard to be funny, but fail miserably. But I believe the number one problem is the new personalities of the characters.Homer, back in the prime of the sitcom, was at times a big jerk who sometimes did things to advantage himself and hurt others, but in the end, he always did the right thing at the conclusion and he was a good guy overall. And although he wasn't a very bright man (His stupidity is one of the highlights of the show) He only had moments when he was a complete dumbass. But now the writers dummed down homer to look like a total retard, he has also evolved to be an unbearable jackass with no redeeming qualities whatsoever (and it seems like now he is spending every minute of every episode doing something incredibly stupid beyond sanity.) Bart used to be a mischievous kid who did get into trouble on occasion, but always knew his limits and acted like a typical ten year old kid. Now, he's more of a whiny brat who tries really hard to be a tough criminal. He also tries to act tough by bullying his nerdy friend Milhouse, whom in earlier seasons, had a good friendship with Bart and he saw Milhouse as an equal and not his flunkie like today. Lisa was a very smart eight year old who had strong beliefs over issues but really tried to live a normal life as an eight year old, but now is a intolerant PC hippie who believes her views are superior to anyone elses. And Marge, well, shes still the housewife, but she seems to care less nowadays and will sometimes try way to hard to be ""cool"" and ""hip"" but always failing to be funny. Maggie is the one who changed the least, but shes only one year old, so you can't expect much. The side characters (Moe, Mr. Flanders, etc) also seemed to change as well, though for the worse.Finally, the Simpsons was the greatest sitcom back in the heyday, but now is crumbling like a wall. I stopped watching the show a few years ago because I just couldn't take the declining quality anymore. The bad plots, poor jokes and repackaged personalities of the characters are beginning to cause the show's decay. I won't dismiss the show's past accomplishments, but the new episodes are downright unbearable. I recommend the show, but get the seasons three to six, you'll laugh out loud. The first two seasons are good, but didn't get that edge just yet. Anything later then 1997 I wouldn't watch, but like a wise man said, ""Opinions are like assholes, everybody has one"" So see it for yourself and make up your own judgment.",NA,"17 July 2006"
"100","The Simpsons first aired in December of 1989. With that first episode in which Bart Simpsons gets a tattoo for Christmas and scandalizes his family, the antics of this functionally dysfunctional family was established. The voices behind the characters are Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Tress Mcneille and many others. The Simpsons has enjoyed huge success. For 16 years, seasons, and more than 200 episodes, they are still the funniest and smartest cartoon on TV. If you take a good close look, you will see that the Simpsons are witty and clever social satire on today's society. It's really a cartoon adults can enjoy as well.Homer Simpson is a man who is not afraid to embrace his primitive instincts. He is a boorish, drinks beer at Moe's often, is bald and fat at first glance represents the working class in America. But he is a loving father and has managed to pitch in on his side of the parenting as much as the more mature and wise Marge Simpson, despite the fact that Homer could be lazy. Marge Simpson can be annoying only because she's too level-headed and too cautious. Lisa Simpson stands out because she's bright, sensitive, intellectual and cultured. She is a liberal at heart and actively participates in environment protection, animal rights and is a vegetarian Buddhist. Bart Simpson is a brat with a heart of gold, who despite his wild child nature, has his moments. There are too many episodes that are among my favorite- Bart dates the scheming and bad Reverend Lovejoy's daughter, Homer becomes morbidly obese to get on disability and work from home, Homer nearly cheats on Marge twice (with Country singer Lurlene Lumpkin and Mindy Simmons who is a female version of himself) Lisa gets a crush on a Jewish substitute teacher and then must learn to deal with his parting, Bart and his friends battle it out with rival Shelbyville boys over a stolen lemon tree, the Burlesque House, Marge and Homer explore their sexual relationship through risky sex in public, any episode with Flanders as the focus, the classic episodes from the 90's- Who Shot Mr. Burns ? Lisa gets her first experience with competition when a smarter girl shows up, Homer and Flanders go to Vegas and accidentally get married, all the Halloween episodes ""Tree House of Horror series"" and many others. Among the more colorful characters in Springfield are the evil and hundred plus millionaire, power plant owner Montgomery Burns, his closeted gay assistant Whelan Smithers, bullies Nelson and Jimbo, hilarious Police Chief Wiggums and his son Ralph, Sideshow Bob and Sideshow Mel.. Krusty the Clown, Apu, his wife Manjula and their eight kids. Many celebrates have appeared on the series over the years among them Mel Gibson, Elizabeth Taylor, Butch Patrick, James Woods, Michelle Pfeiffer, Helen Hunt, Lucy Lawless, Frankie Muniz and many others.",NA,"13 February 2005"
"101","Way before most of you might remember, The Simpson's was just a little short that aired in small snippets throughout each episode of The Tracy Ullman Show. That's when my brothers and I began to watch and we were hooked. It was a genius part of our childhood showcasing some of the quirkiest characters, hilarious humor, and brilliant writing.What ruined it? The show became politically correct; it's producer & writers began pandering to sanctimonious whiners who complained that Abu was offensive. Instead of taking a stand and saying 'If you don't like it, don't watch it,' the weak and perhaps self righteous writers cowed to a millennial mindset that suggests the world censor its content to appease their entitled mentality.So The Simpson's caved with no regard for the opinions of those who'd been with them from the beginning. Viewers like myself who'd watched for decades, were disgusted and the choice to pander to bullies instead of having the integrity to stand by characters they had created.","1","12 June 2020"
"102","Yet again, Disney ruin something which was once brilliant. I used to watch The Simpsons and always had laughs at the gags and character exploits: not anymore.

"103","SpoilersThe Simpsons was one of the greatest cartoon shows alive.  I loved this series.  It was funny.  But things have changed.  And to see how much has changed, let me review the series.Season 1:  Somewhat mixed season, but still good(loved it when Homer was mistaken for Bigfoot).  Season 2-3:  Is now starting to find the direction of the series, and its characters.  The animation is also now finding itself.  Also, the series is now on Thursdays.  Seasons 4-5:  Hilarious. The Simpsons has finally struck gold.  These have to be the best in the series(especially season 4).  Seasons 6-7:  Moves back to Sundays.  Still good to watch, even if the ""pure magic,"" isn't as light as it was during the previous seasons.  Seasons 8-9:  Good, but starting to drag down.  Some weak episodes in both seasons.  Seasons 10-11:  A bit better.  Some really good laughs here, although still a weak episode or two.  Season 12:  Mixed.  Some episodes were hilarious(like Trilogy of Error), but others were an embarassment(like the Boy Band episode).  Season 13:  Only a handful of good episodes.  It's obvious the series is losing a lot of steam.  Season 14:  An insult.  The humor is gone, and the characters are now caricatures of their former hilarious selves.  What happened to the good old Homer of yesterday? Season 15:  Okay, the new season won't start for a few weeks, but from what I've read, it's obvious that the writers are running out of ideas for the series, as it will involve the return of old characters from the show, like Mother Simpson, or Rabbi Krustofski.  Not a good sign.This show used to be the best, but it's going down fast.  FOX, hire some new writers, or pull the old ones to put down one amazing finale, but whatever you do, don't let this end on a bad note!BOTTOM LINE:  Skip the current stuff.  The original classics are the ones worth viewing.",NA,"24 October 2003"
"104","This has to be one of the best darn cartoons/comedies ever to grace the T.V screen. The fact that it has been going for nearly 10 years says it all. The comic timing is just right and the jokes are so funny that you're guaranteed to be begging for more! The reason why the show works so well is not because of just the family,no. The minor characters are spot on and they will have you rolling around the floor in fits of laughter more often than Homer, Marge and co. Mr Burns is THE best person on the show in my opinion. People often say that Matt Groening is a genius after every time they watch a show. Okay, I give credit to Matt due to him making up the Simpsons but it is the massive crew which make the Simpsons what it is today. It is the dozen or so writers that give us the dialogue which is unbeatable by any other programme. ( a big cheer to my fave writer John Swartzwelder is in order here!). It is the many gifted animators which give us the many hilarious moments on the show. Without these people and the rest of the crew there would be no Simpsons. Also, another key element in it being enjoyable is the cast. The many talented actors who supply their great voices. (Another big cheer for my favourite voicer Harry ""Handsome"" Shearer.He is my Hero!) Anyhoo, enough is being said. Just don't forget all the crew and praise them as well as Matt Groening. Simpsons Forever!",NA,"10 November 1998"
"105","And thats because it's very, very funny. The first series of The Simpsons, first aired all those years ago when I was an elementary school student myself, were very child-like, both in animation and script, and as the show gained momentum and subsequent seasons made it more and more of a success, the subject matter got more serious, but it retained what it always had from the beginning: a unique wit for pointing out the idiosyncrasies of the real world.By around season 5, the writers had build up an entire world, based around the fictional town of Springfield. Not only that, but all these characters had their own relationships with each other, that remained consistent and believable. The central characters are the Simpson family themselves. Parents Homer and Marge, kids Bart, Lisa and Maggie, their cat and dog, then the extended family: Grumpy grandpa Simpson, who can keep people distracted for hours by telling stories that go nowhere. Marge's unmarried, chain-smoking twin sisters Patty and Selma who live with their pet lizard and despise Homer, then there's all the other characters: next-door-neighbors The Flanders who are so religious only a cartoon could convey it. The staff and students of Bart and Lisa's school, Homer's co-workers and co-drinkers, Krusty the Klown, the TV clown who Bart worships, Police chief Wiggum who is so lazy he believes that people should ""take the law into their own hands"", sleazy bartender Moe, Apu, Reverend Lovejoy, Mr. Burns Homer's miserly boss as well as other interesting characters introduced in later seasons, such as Gil, the hapless loser who's wife has left him and seems to lose every job he gets. And brilliant once-off characters such as Hank Scorpio, The evil head of Globex corporation, who, it could be argued, is a rip-off of a James Bond villain. But that argument is quickly settled by the fact that no James Bond villain has ever been this funny, or indeed, evil. I could go on and on about these characters, but I won't, because if you've never seen the show I wouldn't dare spoil it for you.Now in it's nineteenth season, with the long-awaited feature-length movie about to hit movie screens, I believe The Simpsons has had an incredible run. Its not nearly as funny as it used to be and hence not as popular, and I feel it's substituting very dark undertones where it used to have clever and funny jokes. I don't like this and I think The Show has given us enough laughs for the last 20 years to easily last another 20. I still don't tire of the old shows and there's so many of them the by the time you've sat through them all you've forgotten the first ones. Whether they decide to wrap it up in the next year or so, or if it Rolling Stones approach of going on and on way past its sell-by date, one thing is imminent: The Simpsons will not be forgotten.","9","25 July 2007"
"106","I don't really know what I can say about it. Everyone should have seen this and if you haven't seen it.... watch it now. Seriously. It may be the most quotable show ever. Of course when you have a show that goes on for that long, you can't really develop the main characters much, or you may run the risk of jumping the shark in the eyes of some. But luckily there are many secondary characters who have been able to have some changes made to them if only for a little while, for example Ned Flanders, Barney Gumble and Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. (wow... I love the show so much I was actually able to spell that right.)I honestly don't see it possible for someone to have no love for the Simpsons. Really.The Simpsons can be seen as a breakthrough in prime time television... opening up the world to a more adult form of animation, paving the way to many other shows, such as King of the Hill, South Park and Family Guy. I believe that without this show, it is possible that none of these would exist.I would like to take some time to talk about the characters now. I'll start with Homer, who is a lovable oaf who is just impossible not to like, especially since he always comes through in the end, even though it's clear that he never quite learns his lesson. In more recent seasons he has become a bit more obnoxious, but it is made clear that he is not a bad person, just not very smart. Bart is the bratty 10 year old who actually has a really big heart. The series shows that he is more than just a little pest and that he is willing to go the extra mile to do the right thing. Lisa is the child genius who just wants to make the world a better place. Marge is the housewife who loves her children and her husband with all her heart. And Maggie... she loves her pacifier. Not forgetting Abe Simpson, Homer's senile father who loves to tell stories of the old days. Unfourunately for him, very few of the stories actually make sense.So far there have been more than 400 episodes, and I have watched almost all of them. Most of them I've seen many times. Many of the episode focus on the relationships between the family members. For example Life on the Fast Lane focuses on the relationship between Homer and Marge, Lisa on Ice focuses on Bart and Lisa, Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy focuses on Homer and Abe, and Make Room For Lisa focuses on Homer and Lisa. These are just a few examples of many.The show offers a lot of heart, especially considering it is an animated comedy. Episodes like Moaning Lisa, A Streetcar Named Marge and Bart vs. Thanksgiving are just some of the examples of the great and heartfelt writing that went into many episodes of The Simpsons. And I don't think that heart is gone. We saw some good examples of it in the movie, Marge's Son Poisoning was nice, and I thought Regarding Margie was a sweet episode. (In the literal sense.)This is the show that has always been there for me. It started in 1989, which was the year I was born. And I've watched it for as long as I can remember.I can admit the show isn't as perfect now as it was years ago, but I hardly think it is as bad as people make it out to be. The comparison between early Simpsons and current Simpsons is not really a fair one, as how how can you compare stuff to something that was at the level the early episodes were at. I feel that if they were showing the newer episodes back in 1990, people still would have been hooked. That's just my opinion though.It could always rely on it to make me laugh when things were rough. Even if I'd seen the episode a million times before. I don't care what people think, I still love the show. And that includes the new episodes. It has its faults but it still constantly makes me laugh. I can't thank this show enough for helping me get through rough times with its humour. I will always be a fan. I hope it stays around to entertain me for many years to come.10/10 Every time.","10","13 May 2008"

"109","Since the talented voice cast has remained the same low these many years, I put all the blame on this squarely with the Fox network who refused to let this show go out gracefully when Groening siphoned off his role to work on his dream project, the now far superior 'Futurama'. In Fox's race to claim this endurance record they have turned a once edgy and visionary show into an institution with an assembly line production and revolving door of writers to match any of the other lame shows on TV. Behind the scenes, maybe the condescending we-can-do-no-wrong attitude of Maxton-Graham has dealt the show its biggest death blow, while producer Mike Scully sat back and ineptly let Maxton-Graham run it into the ground. In the end, the biggest blame may actually land with the ""die-hard fans"" that embolden the show by letting it get away with this junk. Yes, ""The Simpsons"" was ground-breaking and every adult animation in the future owns it a bit of gratitude, but blind loyalty to a show only for how it performed in the past isn't healthy. Since it has hit long-running status the critical bandwagon jumping has begun and ""Simpsons"" is more popular than ever amongst critics that want to be on the inside of history. We've now reached a point where the bad episodes and bad entire seasons outweigh the good and that, I'm afraid, is going to be the sad legacy of ""Simpsons"" . A train-wreck of crass, childish humor, grainy animation, oddly misplaced satire and forced parodies of only the most obvious pop culture targets. 10 years ago I didn't know what I would do without ""The Simpsons"" but now, particularly with the emergence of satisfying new adult animated shows ('Futurama', 'Family Guy' and 'South Park'), living without it might be pretty good.",NA,"29 May 2017"
"110","Yes, I thought The Flintstones was great, but The Simpsons is by FAR the best animated show on TV, and with few exceptions--The BEST PERIOD!!! I didn't jump on until midway through the second season, but I've been a die-hard-foam at the mouth Simpsons fan ever since. I go into withdrawal if I don't get my Simpsons fix every day. And Thank goodness for DVD, so when the show does fold or people get too greedy (as those Hollyweird folks tend to do), we'll have it forever! It's irreverent, rude, and just plain funny! It offends just about everybody, but I haven't seen any group complain. And look at the celebrities that seem to be waiting in line to do a cameo. One thing, Simpsons producers... Get the Treehouse of Horrors episodes on their own DVD set - Christmas too! It'll sell--Trust me! THE SIMPSONS FORVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!","10","1 December 2006"
"111","Let's face it, the Simpsons popularity has grown over the last twenty years ever since it made it's debut on the Tracey Ullman Show. Unfortunately that show ended but this show has thrived with some of the cast mates like Julie Kavner and Dan Castellnata as Marge and Homer Simpson. Being an animated show has it's advantages though, gone are those silly actors and actresses because you only need voices. The show works because of the powers behind the show's success. Maggie is still a baby, Bart is still a brat, and Lisa is well the middle child who is smart. The fact that the producers decided to maintain the characters in the same age for 20 years is an achievement in itself. In live sitcoms, the children age and stories change and attention shifts from one character to another. There are episodes that are good and plentiful. They have done everything from Shakespeare to Edgar Allen Poe. I don't know how long this show will run but as long as the audience wants more. They'll be happy to comply.","10","13 May 2007"
"112","Now you are probably what I meant by that huh? And you also probably wonder what ""The Simpsons"" and ""Ren and Stimpy"" have in common, huh? Well here, let me tell you:Well, both were funny shows once, even funny when being gross, offensive or shocking at times. But now, both the shows are so disgusting, shocking and offensive, it is not even funny anymore. Bart becoming alcoholic (What hypocrites! Adult alcoholics aren't funny, but child alcoholics are? WTF)? Marge getting implants and becoming an exotic centerfold? Lisa joing a band of Vegan Hippies? Homer becoming an internet marketer? YES, I know it is a cartoon, but the plots are getting stupider, whether they are in animated form or not.I remember the show used to be funny, the characters used to be believable and the balance of everyday realism and surrealistic fantasy. Now this show has gone out of its mind.Sorry to say, the Simpsons have done everything possible now and Matt Groening should own the rights to the show back and end it for good.OR Groening shoul make spin-off shows on the more interesting characters in the show and work on new and interesting projects.","1","26 May 2004"

"114","Like so many other great shows (""Rugrats"", ""All That"", etc.), this show continues to get worse and worse as it barrels along.  ""The Simpsons"" should've stopped by the end of the 2000-2001 season.  You know, when they were still somewhat funny.""The Simpsons"", a spin-off of the ""Tracy Ullman Show"", started out as an overly dramatic, crudely-drawn show that was at best decent in the first season.  By the next season, however, it was clear the show was on the rise. In season three, it reached its creative peak, with such classic episodes as ""Lisa the Greek"", ""Flaming Moe's"", ""Bart the Murderer"", ""Separate Vocations"", and ""Homer Defined"" (probably THE best Homer episode).  The last great season, in the true sense of the word, was Season 7 (1995-96), ending with the classic ""Summer of 4 Ft. 2"" (in case you didn't notice, I used to be a huge Lisa fan).Season 8 was a standard season: many classics and quasi-classics, almost completely good.  But Season 9 was the sign that things were on their way down.  There were a few funny episodes (""Lisa the Simpson"", ""Realty Bites"", ""Girly Edition"", ""The Joy of Sect"", and ""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson""), but as the show went, it was a mediocre season.
Even after last year's travesty of a season, Season 10 remains the worst season.  Phil Hartman died: that affected the show more than it would appear, because, obviously, his characters, down-and-out movie star Troy McClure and corrupt attorney Lionel Hutz, were extremely hilarious. At first, it  didn't appear that these characters were a necessity (though of course they were missed), but the show lost some of its satirical and even just plain regular humorous edge. As if that weren't bad enough, such God-awful episodes as ""Bart the Mother"" (Hartman's last episode), ""Trash of the Titans"", ""Maximum Homerdrive"" (I laughed maybe three times throughout the duration of that episode), ""Monty Can't Buy Me Love"", ""The Old Man And the 'C' Student"", ""Mom and Pop Art"", and ""They Saved Lisa's Brain"" (until this season, the worst, and only crappy-with-not-a-single-redeeming-feature-what-so-ever) were churned out. Homer had become an unbearable jack@ss; Lisa was an intolerant, tree-hugging, PC b**ch; Bart was completely out of character (apparently the creators want to spend more time hammering home the ""Bart may be gay"" subplot that prevails throughout many episodes of late); and Marge, well, she didn't really care anymore.  Most of the supporting characters stayed in character, but since the show focuses on the Simpsons themselves, we (or at least I) CANNOT forgive them.  The guest stars were wasted worse than ever (save Isabella Rossalini, who for her part did the best she could with the material, and Lisa Kudrow, who I'm not particularly fond of anyway), and their appearances were pointless (eg. ""When You Dish Upon A Star"", with Alec Baldwin, Kim Bassinger, AND Ron Howard [I know Bassinger and Baldwin are married, but what the hell was Howard doing there, save the ""Happy Days"" joke at the end?]).  Plots were recycled and overused (Homer gets a new job, they go on vacation, etc.), and the show relied too much on sight gags (a flaw that first became apparent in Season 6 and only continues to get worse).  And just out of curiosity, WHY does everyone seem to think that ""Simpsons Bible Stories"" is one of the greatest episodes ever?  ""Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo"" was hilarious (though not classic), esp. the end with Godzilla and friends, but obviously it couldn't save the season.Season 11, for the most the part, got back into the swing of things. Again, save the sight gag problem, the episodes were hilarious, such as ""Beyond Blunderdome"" (the one with Mel Gibson), ""Pygmolian"" (Moe's my favorite character, so I pretty much have to like it, given the relative scarcity of Moe episodes), the one with Bart on drugs (forget what it was called), ""Last Tap Dance In Springfield"", ""Bart to the Future"" and the finale, ""Behind the Laughter"", a somewhat self-depricating parody of ""Behind the Music"".  There were some episodes I wasn't thrilled about (""Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder"", ""Eight Misbehavin'"", and ""Kill The Gator And Run"" sucked out loud), but most of the season was very good.Season 12 was a minorly substandard but still quite hilarious one.  Again, gross-out gags and sight gags notwithstanding, this was almost as good as the previous (though hardly classic), with such episodes as the great Halloween one, the one with the Party Posse (actually my favorite episode all-time), the one when Bart, Homer, and Grandpa pull all the heists/jokes, and ""Simpsons Tall Tales"".  Of course, there were crappy ones: ""Bye Bye Nerdy"", which I actually liked until the cop-out ending, another standard Simpsons problem, ""Lisa the Tree-Hugger"", another episode reinforcing the self-centered PC hippy brat that my once-favorite Simpson has become, and, of course, ""Simpson Safari"".  HOW is rhinos hatching out of eggs, Greenpeace being evil (which they might be, but here in a different way), an evil Jane Goodall wannabe who has lots of pearls (what does this have to do with the plot in anyway?), inside-out mosquito nets, hippos afraid of water, and other needless absurdities and reversals of fact funny?  It appears the show has now degenerated to pleasing younger (and, in some cases, MUCH YOUNGER) fans. The finale, ""Simpsons Tall Tales"", made the season a mostly good one overall.Now, Season 13 is here and sucks louder than the Barisal Guns, blows harder than a hurricane, bites harder than a hyena, shark, and pitbull combined, and eats more than a shrew.  The first two episodes of the season were decent, but ""Homer the Moe"" was the worst episode ever.  It wasn't funny in the first place, the hunting scene was another stupid sight gag gone awry (not like it would've been good anyway), and the end with the vegetarian turkey or whatever the hell that was is as funny as being shot in the face while having your heart scraped out with a spoon and your testicles each having a white-hot poker sticking through them with a shovel tearing your stomach out.  YES, IT'S THAT BAD!So I'm through with ""The Simpsons"".  I might check out the next season just for the heck of it, but I sincerely hope it ends soon.Only watch the classics (Seasons 1-8).",NA,"9 July 2002"

I'm not going to go through the trouble of listing my favorite seasons from best to worst because there is too many. So I'll just say my Top 5 seasons. Season 14, Season 15, Season 16, Season 17 and Season 18. I wonder why I like the middle so much. My favorite character is definitely Homer. He is just hilarious. I think he is so funny and so entertaining. It is weird to think that if it was a normal show, where the characters age, Bart would be almost forty years old. That's super weird.This cartoon show centers around the Simpson family. Homer, Marge and their three children, Bart, Lisa and Maggie, go through so much stuff and go on so many adventures.

Family Guy seems to be the ""in thing"" right now and though I love that show as well, The Simpsons is still the hierarchy or animated television. This show can be enjoyed by all races, religions, and ethnicities alike. It's not as racy as the aforementioned competition but still just as (if not more) funny. Things do tend to wear over time and people's likes/dislikes tend to change. I've enjoyed every episode from the first one up until the current ones. The competition does touch topics that, if this show would touch, it would be kind of tasteless. I'll be a fan up until the last and final episode. Nothing has really changed except for people's opinions. Along with Seinfeld, Martin, and Married With Children, The Simpsons is and always will be a most noteworthy sitcom in t.v. history.

Each of the five main Simpson characters were strong and valuable.I highly recommend the series (as if anyone isn't already aware of it) for its first few years. The rest went downhill and became less intelligent and enjoyable, but the series it started out as is some of the best TV you can find. Indeed, I thought it was the best comedy TV until I found Arrested Development, which is the classic Simpsons amplified in all aspects.","9","14 June 2007"
"126","''The Simpson'' are the best TV series of all times, never can you be mad whit this TV series because it's the best.The humor are brilliant showing like are YOU the North Americans and is got the reason who isn't have a drunk father or a nervous mother or a insupportable sister or a crazy bother or another sister that are dumb.It's the reality and if you don't liked you can f*ck off, but if you liked you are great. The cameos are great the stars that like leaf of self are great everything whit ''The Simpson'' are great and my favorite is the word ''doh!''","10","13 August 2006"
"127","That's right. Better than ""Seinfeld"", better than ""Cheers"" better than anything out there in years. Forget that it's a cartoon. The writing is superb, the comdey is hilarious and BEST of all... It is often not expected! I can not count the times I have had near disasters while drinking a beverage during the show. For me the musical numbers are the best part. The ""Sherry Bobbins"" (Mary Poppins) episode is classic viewing! The laughs originate in left field and settle in your chest, to the point of painful laughter. No other TV comedy can come close to this effect week after week. While the characters may be 2 dimensional, their depth is equal to that of humans. They have become part of our society and part of our life. We identify with them! Bravo to the Simpsons and all the wonderful actors and actresses who for so long have made us laugh!",NA,"29 November 1998"
"128","I'm sorry but I'm pretty sure it's common knowledge by now the show has been on a decline for years now, but at this point I believe there is more bad episodes than good with a lot of meh sprinkled in. I have watched every episode of this show and will continue to watch so that title stands and I would be lying if I say I didn't enjoy myself for a portion of it. Though I'd also be lying if I wasn't very critical of this show and I didn't hate a good amount of it's episodes. All and all I feel generous giving this a positive score still (6) but this 6 is carried by how good the good is.","6","19 October 2021"
"129","Much like most great rockstars, the Simpsons should have died a long time ago.It's sad to see one of the greatest animated shows of all time become so tired and worn out.It's been slowly getting worse over the last 15 years but it's got to a point it's now complete unwatchable. Which as a life long fan I feel genuinely sad about.","2","22 August 2019"
"130","Yes The Simpsons may be past its best but it still notches up more laughs per episode than any current American sitcom I have seen. The characters remain fresh and the writing is still great. Sadly the standards of those early seasons was so high that nothing can top it.The Simpsons have become part of American culture and they bring joy to so many people. Everyone has a favourite Simpsons moment and can recall a favourite line from Homer and that surely is the biggest compliment that can be paid to the series.I hope this series continues to be enjoyed and watched for many years to come.","9","14 August 2010"
"131","I love the Simpsons. I think every single person in my whole entire family just adores the Simpsons. My favorite episode in the Simpsons is King-Size Homer. My favorite character is Dr. Nick Riveria.The Simpsons is one of the few cartoons in which someone actually dies. Maude dies, Bleeding Gums Murphy dies, and Hans Moleman constantly dies. Moleman is a peanut like man that always has mishaps and always dies. It is impossible not to love poor little Hans Moleman.The Simpsons is about a family that lives in Springfield that constantly have realistic adventures and plot twists. The family members are named Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, and Grampa Simpson. There are actually some emotional and heartwarming episodes. The Simpsons is also one of the few cartoons that actually have sad endings. Mother Simpson has a sad ending.The Simpsons is probably the funniest cartoon ever. The Simpsons is not meant for young children, though. It is made for adults, but older children will love it, too. People swear. This is a great cartoon, but sometimes it doesn't feel like a cartoon.","9","16 February 2007"
"132","Seasons 3 to around 8 are the golden years! (My opinion) 10/10 there just classics and funny still today. But with all these recent episodes I must give the show at most, a six. The writing is no where near as funny as It used to be, the characters have changed to much and sometimes there doesn't seem to have a b story, and I love the B stories! But the most tragic thing is the animation, it has got so incredibly boring and robotic there is no life and no matter how ""clean"" it looks it just does not look right.

"133","The Simpsons has always been true TV brilliance.  Everything about it is remarkable: the art, the characters, the voicing, the humor, the story, and the satire.  The show pokes fun at all of society's sacred cows, leaving no stone unturned, which partially explains its enormous popularity.  Without a doubt, the shows best character has always been Homer Simpson, the loveable goof and head of the Simpson household.  Many irate fans have noted that Homer's increasingly stupid behavior hsa led the series down a path of ridiculousness.  True, the stories are more ludicrous than ever, but the show is every bit as fun as it was back in its heyday (season 7 and 8).  As a matter of fact, season 12 may very well have been my favorite season, period.  Season 13 featured one of The Simpsons' most hilarious episodes, entitled ""Hunka hunka Burns in love.""  Admittedly, season 14 hasn't been particularly good, with the only standout episode being the Halloween special, but the show is still entertaining and nothing else on TV approaches its scathing brilliance.",NA,"15 March 2003"
"134","Kowabunga!! The characters are all classics on this show. What this show does so well when you watch it a lot is defines it's characters sharply & throw in so much comedy that the throw away lines are even great. When you watch this enough & think Bart, Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie, Moe, Crusty the Clown, Montgomery Burns, & Abu (among others), you get a mental picture of the character & sometimes see people in your real life who resemble them. Some of the resemblance is deliberate when you consider Matt Gronig's mind. Some of it is happen stance.Regardless, the show will always have its critics because it does shoot from the hip & hit raw nerves about almost any subject. In truth, it is that edge that makes it great. It takes any topic & lampoons it. It recreates great scenes from past TV & movies & lampoons them. Nothing is sacred on the Simpons. That's Funny!!!","9","17 October 2006"
"135","In 1989, The Simpsons came into FULL existence with their first season ever and since then, through the 90's, We were introduced to Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson who were so god damn interesting! Each character we got introduced to were so interesting to see, Moe and Barney along with Karl and Lenny, Kent and Patty and Selma... UGH! I can't deny but say I loved each and every single character except for Marty. A fair few Simpsons Episodes were highly enjoyable and entertaining. I'm going to pick some of my personal favorite episodes which are... Summer of 4ft. 2, The Springfield files, Homerpalooza, ""HOW 90's could you get with an episode like that!!!???!?!?!, they had the Smashing Pumpkins in for voice acting and Sonic youth along with cypress hill.... OH MY GOD!!!! If they did this episode any earlier around, 1992 or 1993, they would of been able to have Kurt Cobain in the episode... But, We can only dream..."" ALSO DID YOU KNOW, Sonic Youth threatened not to be in the episode if Courtney Love was cast in it? Now you do. Homer the heretic, Homer the Moe, The Mysterious voyage of our Homer, Hurricane Neddy, Lisa's date with density, A Milhouse divided, And many more...I believe season 21 is where things started to feel more drained, they weren't that funny and I can only stumble across 1 or 2 episodes that I might like each season...I'm sorry but I just don't like season 21 and the other seasons that came after it...I just think they're getting desperate to stay irrelevant... I'm more of a fan of seasons 2 through 20 than I am season 21 and onwards.You see, I grew up watching the Simpsons; I would sit at the dinner table watching the Simpsons as it came on at 6pm every night on channel 10 here in Australia. Such good times! Classic episodes and wonderful memories! Each and every single time I watch these older episodes, I get a strong flow of Nostalgia! I highly recommend watching seasons 1 through 20, 9/10","9","26 April 2017"

"137","The simpsons were the best for the first 12 seasons but a decline each season from 4 to 12. By season 13 to today are terrible. The plots do not make sense and there are some differences with the simpsons. Homer is stupid but he was hilarious. Now he is a dimwit that is just plain stupid. Marge is more boring each season, Bart is an Alcohoic how funny. Lisa is so annoying about being so smart. Maggie is still the same from the start. I really think this show will not last long due to the boring episodes they had and the low ratings they have. For some reason the intro are more interesting than the whole episode I just don't get why they are doing that. The simpsons is having the same fate as spongebob with some great seasons at first but turn to trash. First 12 13/10 13 to recent 3/10The only hope for the simpsons to be great again is that the simpsons family guy special is good and the rest of season 26 to more than just par.","10","26 August 2014"

The Simpsons was funny every single time I see it, up until the 15th season. The 15th season is good, but not as good as seasons 1-14. Still, a great show with tons of laughs. My favourite character is Homer, then Bart, then Mr. Burns, followed by everyone else, then Lisa. Lisa is just not funny. She annoys me.

As the show has been on for over twenty years and it will be sad when it is canceled just IF it is! As the family from you know where led by Homer Simpson as he means well but can really come off really a jerk. Though with a heart of gold. His straight man like wife Marge, hardworking homemaker who tries to keep the peace but fails.As Bart the underachiever oldest of the three, may go down that path. Lisa is the brilliant genius and makes straight As. And is on the verge of being first female President perhaps. And Maggie the cute sucking pacifier baby who shows signs of genius as well.But they are so dysfunctional that they are so laughable. That is what makes them like a family of ours. No family is perfect. They prove beyond that.Can't believe this show is still on. But have not watched it in years but kind of catch bits and parts of it! Still funny!","7","24 February 2013"
"144","I fear for The Simpsons Movie. It's either going to be great or be cr*p - there's no in-between. There is little denying that the show has started to take a tumble in recent years - the distinct Simpsons style of humour is getting weak, and though Matt Groening and co. can always cook up interesting new plots at will, the episodes are starting to fall in general quality and laugh-factor. One particular recent episode was very funny - I forget what it's called, but it delivered one classic quote from the Comic Book Guy who was speaking about Stan Lee - ""His mind is not in mint condition!"" (Was it Stan Lee? I'm not sure.) Though the animation is not hot in the 1989-91 episodes, those were the days when the Simpsons was fresh, new and something like nothing which had never hit screens before. But over 300 episodes later, the formula is starting to get tired, and though it's very enjoyable to watch, I'm fearful that The Simpsons Movie will be just bad and immature. But there is also a chance that it will be bloody brilliant, and I still give The Simpsons a 10 for the plain fact that it has completely changed TV and our modern world. 10/10","10","15 January 2007"

"146","Much can be said about Matt Groening's ""The Simpsons"", it paved the way for modern day adult animation with political comments mixed with absurd humor and traditional sitcom laughs. However, since the 1989 premiere, ""The Simpsons""declining quality has been obvious. It's been happening slow and steadily and the reasons can be discussed. Perhaps has the time ran away from this classic show, with alternatives such as ""Family Guy"", ""South Park"", ""Rick and Morty"" and others, most of which are more raw and unexplicit, the place for ""The Simpsons"" might just have been taken. Nothing lasts forever, and while the vast majority of seasons has a good standard, this series should end before it spirals down further into the pit of irrelevancy.","7","22 July 2019"
"147","I hate it that people who grew up with (and loved) The Simpsons have stopped watching it. You can't say that the quality has gone downhill if you aren't watching it.The early Simpsons seasons, yes, were amazing. They were iconic and they were a big part of our childhood. If you compare new episodes to what the Simpsons meant to you in the 90s, then of course it is not going to hold a candle to that. The Simpsons was ground breaking and made a huge impression on my generation (and a whole lot of other people). Are the new seasons as good as classic seasons? I wouldn't say that, but I also would argue that it is not fair to compare them.New Simpsons episodes are for the most part good. In the range between B and A/A+They are not the same as classic Simpsons and they are not all consistently the same quality, but I look forward to it every week and it rarely disappoints.It is comfort food TV. It had been on for most of my life and has been a constant staple. In my opinion, still the best show on television.","10","18 October 2019"

"149","I really love The Simpsons, the 90's episodes are the best. I really liked it going up to season 13 but it started going downhill. But it really started going downhill after its 20th anniversary. The early episodes are excellent. There's no doubt about it. Some of the best episodes include Lisa's First Word, A Streetcar Named Marge, Hurricane Neddy, Homer's Odyssey and of course the episodes with Sideshow Bob in them. They had lots of laughs, were very entertaining and if you had a bad day, they would lighten you up.After the tenth season, the quality started to decline. Although an episode originally aired in 2001, New Kids on the Blecch, I really enjoyed. Other episodes in seasons 11-13 I liked as well. But episodes in seasons 14-19 weren't as great. After its 20th anniversary, the series declined immensely. They had guest stars like Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga. Why!? The episodes from seasons 20 on aren't funny at all. The animation improved, that's the only thing good about it. I think it's time to wrap up the series altogether. It should have stopped after its 13th or 14th season.I don't like the newer episodes at all, but I love the 90's episodes and the episodes in the very early 2000's.

Homer is now the icon of American dad, sloppy, drunk, wacko, but loving parent and husband.

"151","You can cancel ""Games of Thrones"" or ""Family Guy"" and nobody would care, but the heart of soul of Television is<U+0085> (clouds separating) The Simpsons.After three decades (can you believe it?), Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie and all Springfield's townspeople went the distance, resisting criticism even from fans of the first hour. The show didn't let itself dictated by fans, a mistake most sitcoms do, but on the contrary, found the way to precede their own tastes and expectations. Of course, nothing will ever beat the magical 90's, a time were theSimpsonsinfluenced Pop Culture before Pop Culture would influence them, but you can't expect something that spans three decades not to evolve the slightest bit, format and style-wise.And it's a credit to Matt Groening, son of Homer Groening, not to just have come up with the simplest yet most ingenuous concept (something he put on the paper in less than thirty minutes in a waiting room, borrowing names from his own relatives), but to have made it last. And it lasted because it evolved, however unpleasant some changes were. Just take Walt Disney, the show's regular punching ball and check for yourself the differences between""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""The Sword in the Stone"",26 years later. Now, speaking from my experience, I had to wait till the mid-90's before watching the first episodes. So it was a late discovery, but I watched the show starting with the first seasons, and since I was raised by 80's sitcoms like""The Cosby Show"", ""Who's the Boss"" or""Growing Pains"", I loved to see an animated series that carried much more depth and realism than all these live-action programs combined. It was just, to use a hackneyed term, like watching your family in a mirror.Indeed, Bart was the bratty underachiever with a good conscience, Marge was the loving and hardworking housewife, Homer the well-meaning, sometimes idiotic, sometimes hot-tempered father and Lisa, the voice of reason. It was just fine, and I was cringing whenever something 'unrealistic' happened, Maggie sleeping with bears, an angry mob wanting to kill Bart after he decapitated Jebediah Springfield's statue, Homer spectacularly falling in the stairs in""Crepes of Wrath""or Bart's slavery in the same episode. I was thinking, can't they make an episode like""Moaning Lisa""for instance? Yeah right, ""Moaning Lisa""!After Season 1, I hoped it would never get over the top and spoiled that trademark realism . Guess what happened after? The channel aired Season 5, so talk about a chronological leap, so many new characters from the Mayor to the Comic Book Guy, and so many ludicrous plots. I hated every single one of them, even the classic""Cape Fear"" and the racks scene annoyed me like you can't imagine. I was done with the show. I feel ridiculous now, but the funny thing is that many comments on the Internet capsule expressed similar doubts, and it was years before the official ""Pauper""s shark-jumping episode, a time deemed now as Golden Age. A few months after, I bumped into an episode of Season 2, and I thought it was surprisingly good: realistic, warm and funny with a little touch of zaniness. Season 2 is still my favorite season because it revived my love for the show, one that never faded, and it featured some of the most classic moments: ""Bart the Daredevil""'s unforgettable climax, the Fugu episode, Homer meeting Marge, Bart crying after getting an F and my all-time favorite,""Lisa's Substitute""(Homer's finest hour at the end makes it one of the best twist endings of the series). Season 3 and 4 were, as Burns would say, excellent, and when the 5th season was re-run, I finally enjoyed the episodes because I could see the transition.After that, I think we can all agree that the chances of being disappointed hugely dropped and Season 6-7-8 provided some of the best episodes of the show: ""Lisa the Vegetarian"", ""Homer the Great"" or ""You Only Move Twice"" to name a few.But that never stopped the criticism, and after the ""Principal and Pauper"" episode, no one would've bet a penny on one more decade, and the following seasons made it even worse. Now, Season 11 is a classic full of so many great moments such as the octuplets' birth, Maude's death and the cow mooing""Tomacco!"". Many episodes aged very well, and that's a credit to the writers' talent. Even the then- detestable""Saddlestore Galactica"" is now regarded as a brilliant episode full of tongue-in-cheek humor from the authors, telling fans, we understand what you don't like but you better get used to it, because that's the new way of the Simpsons And let's admit it, wouldn't we watch the so hilariously over-the-top ""Marge vs. the Monorail"" rather than ""Moaning Lisa""? In the late 90's and early 2000's most animated shows were satirical, pushing very far the parody button. The Simpsons didn't wait for""South Park"" or""Family Guy""before making 'crazy humor' the rule rather than the exception. Of course, now, Homer became the main character, Lisa's liberalism became annoying and Marge isn't much of a character (there must be more episodes centered on Moe than Marge alone) but there was always a reason or a combination of reasons for all these changes.In the end, ""The Simpsons"" created characters, places, catchphrases, songs and words, a whole parallel universe that isn't just part of America's Pop Culture but the world, imagine that almost a quarter of the population was born when the Simpsons already existed, it's an era-defining phenomenon just like Chaplin or the Beatles, of the same epic scale as the Human Comedy by Honore de Balzac, tailor-made for the TV format and liable to evolve in the most disconcerting ways, like we all do.These are facts and they transcend personal opinions, so, don't have a cow and enjoy the show, and if you feel 'meh' about it, remember THEY popularized this word.","10","3 May 2016"
"152","The Simpsons used to be such a great show, easily the best on TV. It's humour and satire were brilliant and it was very well written.It seems that almost every kid nowadays will quote ""The Simpsons"" to each other, even I still quote it to my friends at University.But, like a lot of great series, it started to become sour. The series started to go downhill around season 10 and hasn't stopped since. I first noticed how bad Simpsons had become with episodes like the one where they go to Spring Break, and the Halloween episode where Homer gets cloned. To get an idea of how bad it's become, in the most recent season there can be maybe one laugh for every 3 or 4 episodes. In fact, there are more laughs and clever moments in a single episode from either series 5,6 or 7, then there are in an entire season from 14 onwards.Arguably some of the earlier episodes weren't that funny either, but they're missing the point. Those episodes were mostly satirical, plus there's the hit-and-miss quality. It's like comparing Dr. Strangelove to any of the Scary Movie's. Dr. Strangelove is a brilliant satire, and when it tries to be funny it mostly succeeds. Scary Movie, however, piles on the dumb jokes hoping that for every 20 jokes that aren't funny, there is 1 that is.In summary, watch if until season 10 or 11, after that don't even bother.","3","11 November 2005"
"153","It's not really funny, I mean honestly who can honestly say this show frequently makes them ""laugh out loud"" cause most I ever do is half hearted giggle once in every blue moon.
It's more on the relatable and interesting to watch than on the funny side.
Humor is as repetitive as possible, heavily relying on Homer's doh's and woohoo's, on Flander's diddly diddly and on Burns' ""excellent."" Same thing in every episode in 30 seasons. Never gets old, huh? Well it does.
A very large number of episodes is downright boring because it revolves around side characters, which are... Well bland, basic, boring, nothing very funny or interesting about them. And then they make whole episodes about them. I mean Krusty, Patty and Selma, Moe, Barny, Apu... Really. Ugh.
And worst thing yet, the nasty small town mentality. Bunch of dumb religious zealots, hypocrites. Everyone knows everything about everyone, you can't even bat an eyelash cause the whole town will magically know about it within minutes. Then they praise or condemn you, depending on what you did... Everything you do is their business. It can be funny at times, and would be fine if it was limited to a few episodes, but instead it's something that happens in most episodes.
Still it can be interesting to watch at times. Irritates and bores me pretty easy though.","5","4 October 2020"

I watched the first 10 seasons of the show and I considered it one of the greatest animated shows in my eyes. Season 11 came along and the plots got more weaker and predictable, I still went along and watched more, I came upon on season 13 and decided to drop the show completely since it grew boring on me.

People, there's better ways to express things, while you're even learning something in the whole process, and trust me watching ""The Simpsons"" is not one of them. Watch the Late Shows, because they are way more amusing and you might get some extra intelligence watching them. At least from my point of view, ""The Simpsons"" seems more like a tribute to the ones with bad families, like getting drunk, and simply fooling around with real-life moments.This show is something that helped bring you the so-brilliant things like ""Bevis and Butt-head""","1","28 November 2015"
"158","So now we get to my absolute favorite TV show. This is the only show that I have all of the DVD's of. The show premise is basically the same as Family Guy where the family of yellow gets into some wild and crazy situations only except this is more clean than Family Guy. My favorite episode would have to be ""Treehouse Of Horror"", all of them because I love it when a show or movie is an anthology episode or movie where it focus's on multiple stories rather than 1 story throughout the whole episode or movie which is why I love Pulp Fiction so much. This is definitely 1 show I recommend.Rated TV-PG DLSV For Suggestive Dialouge, Language, Sexual Content And Violence.30min.Rare uses of the F-word.****/****",NA,"4 November 2011"
"159","Leave the musicals to Matt and Trey, this episode is trite and boring. This is the first time ever I stopped watching an episode of The Simpsons before it ended. I was done one-third of the way through. It cries, ""Help us, we've run out of ideas."" Time to stick a fork in it.","4","27 September 2021"

"161","The Simpsons is clearly the greatest show in amercian history. The show which has been on for over ten years has stood the test of time and only gets funnier with each season. My favorite characters on the show are Snake,Homer and Ralph. Whenver they appear I almost choke from laughing so hard.I love this show.","9","25 February 2002"
"162","When I saw the Simpsons show I was really into it and entertained and I thought the show was hilarious. I enjoyed and loved some of the jokes they had, but as the show progressed it got offensive by it started bashing God and Jesus and I am a man of faith. I couldn't watch the show anymore because of the things the show said. After I still gave it a chance and stayed open minded and tried not to judge it, but the things the movie said made me uncomfortable. So I am writing this review to say that I would've enjoyed it, if only the bashing of not only my families beliefs, but also, other people's beliefs in a higher power wasn't thrown as jokes like that. It's fine to have your own opinions, but don't bash people's beliefs. That's messed up. All in all, I would never watch the show or movie again.","1","25 June 2014"
"163","I used to love the Simpsons just like everyone else and would never miss an episode on channel 2 or sky one, but i haven't watched it in ages, probably haven't seen a new episode since about 2001 (except the one Simon Cowell was in and the one Ricky Gervais wrote) and this is because the new ones are nothing in comparison to the earlier ones.All programmes lose steam after a while and they usually end after eight or so series but here the Simpsons is still going after 18 years and they've run out of good ideas! I wish they had ended it years ago when the show was on a high but now i get to the point where i think ""Oh god not another new Simpsons episode"" because there's no where else to go with it, they even had to bring in Ricky Gervais for a change of pace which failed miserably because that episode was self indulgent and boring. Please end it now before it gets even worse! OK i'll stop being negative now and get to the good points. The characters are hilarious and there are so many to choose from, my favourites being Lisa, Mr. Burns, Sideshow Bob, Ralph, Chief Wiggum and Homer.The early episodes were not only funny but also silly and witty at the same time, the writing was unmatchable and it was hard to believe you were watching an animation. So many episodes stand out like the hilarious 'Cape Feare' or the funny yet sad 'One fish two fish...' and other such as 'Brother from another series,' 'Lisa's substitute,' and 'Bart sells his soul' are great too.I'm not knocking the programme as i was a fan all through my childhood (still am a fan of early eps) and it's always nice to turn on the TV and catch a repeat of Homer, Bart and co.","7","21 August 2007"

"165","The Simpsons is show that been going on since December of 1989. The thing is I just got in to this wonderful show. The Simpson is a show about a Dysfunctional family named The Simpsons. There Homer Simpson who is the lazy dad. Marge Simpson is the wife and best friend of Homer. Then there the kids Bart Simpson is a trouble maker son who spray paints on Springfield Elementary School. And then there Lisa Simpson who is very smart and is the opposite of Bart. My Favorite episode is the very first episode which is The Simpsons roasting on open fire. The voice acting is also great Dan Castellaneta as Homer, Krusty the Clown, Barney Gumble and Grandpa Simpson is great also Nancy Cartwright as Bart Simpsons is awsome & the couch gags are clever & hilarious. BOTTOM LINE THE SIMPSONS is an Awesome show. 10 out 10 stars for sure Update on 7/3/18","10","1 July 2015"
"166","This is definitely the best ANIMATED show on television. I have been a Simpsons fan for a long time, and over the years it has been going downhill, but recently its been really funny! I think that this is best for people who LOVE SEEING GREAT COMEDY AT WORK! Matt Groening is one of the funniest TV people ever (though I should be fair, a lot of the Simpsons is the writers, if not most of it). For those who don't know, it's about a dysfunctional family living in a town called Springfield (the state is unknown!!!!). There's Homer, the dimwitted father working at the Nuclear Powerplant. Then there's Marge, the housewife who is the classic mom. There's Bart, the spiky haired hell-raiser who has a knack for getting in trouble. There's Lisa, the intellectual middle child who plays the Saxaphone and is the smartest one in the family. Then finally there's Maggie, the baby that only talks in sucks on her pacifier. All in all, each episode includes their many misadventures including a meteor hitting the earth, and Homer causing Y2K. Bottom line, totally funny!","10","2 April 2007"
"167","It was the funniest, the most heart warming, the most ingenious, ... , to simply put, it was the best show ever created on TV. But then, as so many have pointed out, something went wrong after 10 seasons or so.So what went wrong? the simplest way to put it is to say that somewhere along the line the show had lost its soul. Last few episodes I've watched, it was a bit like watching Simpson robots acting out Simpsons, doing and saying what they are supposed to in a Simpson's like story line. Everything was just too forced and too contrived.Just look at Homer, when the show started despite all his flaws and failings, he had a sweet nature that was endearing. He was a terrible father and a terrible Husband, but still, he was a loving father and a loving husband. He didn't just go on a misguided adventures just for the sake of it, usually they were with good intentions, and we could always count on him to do the right thing when the push came to shove. But in today's Homer Simpson all these characteristics were drained from him and what is left is just a shell, which is nothing more than a programed robot countlessly repeating Homer's catch phrases and acting out only the idiotic nature of what once was a Homer Simpson. There is nothing endearing about the Homer you see today, and you can say the same about the rest of the Simpsons characters.It is easy to criticise what is wrong about the show today knowing how good the show was and the bar it had set was simply not possible to maintain forever. Simpsons will never reach its golden heights again, but does it need to? The answer is no, its legacy was already set during first 10 seasons, and that has kept the show going some 15 years later, still. I do not watch the new episodes of Simpsons anymore but I rarely turn away from any of the old episodes if I happen to catch them.","9","24 July 2013"
"168","there's no denying it. the Simpson's is a mere shadow of its former glory. of course its a universal constant that what goes up must come down, and the Simpson's reached their peak about series 3-6. i cant even watch the first threes series any more because i have simply thrashed them to death, i must have seen each episode at least 40-50 times. but thats why i love the Simpson's with such a passion: i grew up with them.with its reliance on violence and lame jokes that a writer for ""Friends"" would balk at, the Simpson's is just a money making machine now...no inspiration or comic genius is apparent and yet, somehow it still remains watchable.",NA,"27 December 2004"
"169","Why does everyone keep saying that The Simpsons is the best show on television?  If anything, it's a lamest show on earth! I must admit I have watched it a couple of times during the first season when it was at the height of it's popularity.  It was hate at first sight to me!The reason why I'm against it is because it's an absoloute insult to everything, it rips off scenes from movies, it's that pop-culture thing. And what makes it even more insulting is that they portray Bart and the kids as the heroes and the adults on the show as the enemies.  Also, it's child exploitation to the extreme!  Showing Lisa get pushed around, beat up, Bart going around like a little sociopath, goofing off and Bart has no heart whatsoever, don't be fooled, people!  And you got the drunken Homer who's totally pathetic and seriously unfunny, and the domineering wife, Marge. Also, the writers put the kids in situations that adults would normally be in.Also, it's another one of those endless stream of family/kiddie sit-coms with precocious smart-allecky kids, and dumb parents.  I hope The Simpsons gets axed and put in a deep, dark spot in hell!  Or, al least end up in the trash heap, where it should've gone to begin with!!!!  DEATH TO THE SIMPSONS!!!!!",NA,"19 October 1999"
"170","Too be completely honest, I don't like very much cartoons, and I don't understand why some of them are so popular (Like the annoying and overrated series called ""Family Guy"") However, I do like ""The Simpsons"", and I think that it is one of the best television shows ever made, having lots of different characters (I Think that Homer is quite annoying, but the other characters are very interesting and funny, specially Lisa Simpson, Maggie, Marge and Ned Flanders) many funny situations and lot of good celebrities occasionally appearing in the series, making it more entertaining.The jokes are fun, and the cultural references are very clever and well done. This is a very enjoyable series, with something to offer to everyone, and I think that's the main reason why ""The Simpsons"" could be easily considered the best cartoon ever made.","10","19 September 2012"
"171","I have been an avid fan of the ""The Simpsons"" since in started when I was only four years old. The show has been almost always uniformly perfect from the start. My whole childhood and adolescence would be unthinkable without them. I thought I might grow out of them but the series has grown up with me. I love it. I haven't always been able over the recent years to watch and cherish all the episodes due to school and work. But I always watch the show when I have the opportunity. I have seen the trailer for ""The Simpsons"" movie and cannot wait for it to come out. I will be first in line to see it. ""The Simpsons"" have inspired ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"". No they are not as good as the ""The Simpsons"". They are good on their own terms. But ""The Simpsons"" started it all. And nothing can be compared to it. May, This show rocks forever. I hope to be still viewing it when I am old and gray. Vive La Simpsons!","10","16 November 2006"
"172","Ever since I started watching ""The Simpsons"" when it first started, it has been my favorite show. They just make fun of EVERYTHING! Aside from the fact that there are an infinite number of pop culture references and spoofs, they always look at current issues. Whether it's anti-immigrant sentiment, jingoism or gay marriage that passes through Springfield (the semi-fictional city where the show happens), you can count on ""The Simpsons"" to do something about it.And the characters. Homer is the D'oh-grunting, dim-witted, beer-guzzling, TV-obsessed, short-tempered, dangerously overweight dad. No matter what happens, he always comes close to screwing up everyone's existence. His constant injuries are pure belly laughs.Marge is the ever-concerned mom with hair shaped like a cactus. As everyone in the family often gets into some kind of trouble, she always has to scold them, usually unsuccessfully. Also, she always has some complaint for the local government, whether or not they listen to her.Bart is dude-saying, skateboarding, Krusty- and Itchy-and-Scratchy- and Radioactive-Man-obsessed, El-Barto-spray-painting son. His abundant pranks tend to get someone in trouble. His best pranks are of course his uncouth phone calls to Moe's Tavern, which result in massive embarrassment for Moe.Lisa is the left-wing, vegetarian, Buddhist, sax-playing daughter. As the only true intellectual in the family, she is often the one who gets the family out of trouble. She is always involved in the latest political cause (including tree-sitting).Maggie is the pacifier-sucking baby. Naturally, there is little to say about her...or is there? As for the other characters, there is Abe, the grandfather who tells dubious stories about his exploits; Patty and Selma Bouvier, Marge's sullen, DMV-operating sisters;Ned Flanders, the excessively pious neighbor;Principal Seymour Skinner, a Vietnam veteran with a tyrannical mother; Edna Krabappel, Bart's half-attentive teacher who is usually having an affair with Skinner; Groundskeeper Willie, the janitor who never lets anyone forget his Scottish heritage;Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, the Kwik-e-Mart owner who sells the unhealthiest food; Moe Szyzlak, the crude-mannered barkeep whose attempts at relationships are overshadowed by Bart's prank phone calls;Mr. Burns, the power plant owner who epitomizes the crass capitalist;Waylon Smithers, Mr. Burns' very gay lackey; Lenny Leonard and Carl Carlson, Homer's co-workers who may or may not have something going;Julius Hibbert, the physician who chuckles at inappropriate times; Tim Lovejoy, the drawling reverend; John Frink, the buck-toothed scientist who seems like a cross between the ""Gilligan's Island"" professor and any character from ""Revenge of the Nerds""; Comic Book Store Guy, always obsessed with ""Star Trek"" or anything else involving androids; Joe Quimby, the John Kennedy-esque mayor who has a million affairs and is always beholden to the mafia; Clancy Wiggum, the corrupt police chief who finds more time to eat donuts than to arrest criminals; Krusty the Klown, the kid-appealing clown who makes a whole array of dangerous products; Kent Brockman, the sour and oft biased anchorman; Rainier Wolfcastle, the Arnold Schwarzenegger-esque movie star who appears in the most idiotic action flicks; Fat Tony, the local mafioso who can buy out any authority figure; Milhouse Van Houten, Bart's geeky, bespectacled friend; Nelson Muntz, the school bully who always has a soft side;Martin Prince, the school nerd who remains eternally stuck up; and Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II, the Simpsons' dog and cat, respectively.Like I said, the whole show just makes fun of everything. Their best episodes are at Halloween (examples: Bart resurrects zombies, Homer becomes 3-D, and a Harry Potter spoof). What's really good about the show is that all the characters are flawed, but they're all well-meaning. Except for Mr. Burns. He's consistently malicious, doing things such as blocking out the sun so that the whole city has to buy power from him.So, that's why ""The Simpsons"" is, and always will be, my favorite TV show. One change that I have noticed is that the show used to be more Bart-centric, but is now more Homer-centric. But that's okay. I recommend ""The Simpsons"" to anyone and everyone!",NA,"28 March 2005"
"173","THE SIMPSONS is a really cool television show and I'm going to explain this into 10 facts, instead of just an in-depth review: 1. The characters are just memorable and the voice actors plays them very well.2. The show spawned into a mega franchise, including a movie, which came out in 2007 and I reviewed it on IMDb.3. My favorite characters on the show are Maggie Simpson and Bart Simpson and I love the way they are created.4. The theme is composed by Danny Elfman and is one of his most memorable themes, that has ever done for a movie or TV show.5. The animation is still great today, as it was in 1989, when the series first premiered on Fox.6. The title sequence at the beginning of the film and it was really amazing and just spectacular as now as it was back then.7. My favorite episodes, I just can't describe them, but I like all of the episodes in each season.8. The ""Treehouse of Horror"" episodes are not really all that scary and is just simply cool and amazing as hell.9. The character designs are just amazing and I give credit to the creators including Matt Groening and James L. Brooks 10. The couch gags on every episode of the TV show is just amazing and really well thought out and very amazing. My favorite ones are the Etch-A-Sketch gag, the 500 episodes gag, the ""Treehouse of Horror"" episodes couch gags and of course, the dancing couch gag with the elephants and the Egyptian dancing in the second episode of the second season.Overall, these are the reasons why I watch THE SIMPSONS.","10","29 April 2015"
"174","The Simpsons was the most excellent show in the face of television.  The humor wacked, the characters funny and the episodes outstanding.  It's the greatest TV show in the world...

I have never see such stupid not funny show in all my life. This as got to be the worst show on TV. Do not watch this show it is so stupid. It is badly written.

Seeing Citizen Kane and Godfather II alone will show you dozens of episode references.The Simpsons is smart, funny, poignant, irreverant, daring, and immensely entertaining. Everyone is a target - Left Wing, Right Wing, Southerners, Northerners, Men Women, Young, Old, Police, Lawyers, Doctors, teachers - no-one is safe.

This show has been on the air since December 1989, and how many shows can say they have been as successful as The Simpons I'll tell you not many. This show is so awesome. It may not be as funny as it used to be but it's still great. There are so many great episodes like Deep Space Homer, The Treehouse of Horror Episodes, Cape Feare, and Rosebud just to name some. So there are way too many great episodes to count. So The Simpons are amazing and whenever this show does end it should be remembered as one of the best shows of all time.

"179","Okay, who's honestly reading this, thinking ""Hmm, should I watch The Simpsons?"" ? With 26 seasons and daily reruns on Fox, everyone has watched some episodes, if not many.I believe I've watched all the episodes, for better or for worse. ^^' I believe its the best thing I can watch on prime time. Its nice to watch during dinner, doing dishes, or to pass the time.Since every episode is stand-alone, and there's over 550 episodes through three decades, I have to talk about the show in broad terms. So, here's the top 3 best things and worst things about The Simpsons.THE BEST 1. The characters are pretty good. They are cartoonish, but likable, three dimensional, and funny. There isn't a character in the large regular cast that I hate to see. I particularly enjoy the unfortunately true-to-life Comic Book Guy, the rude child entertainer Krusty the Clown, and the apathetic elementary teacher Edna Krabappel. The cast is ready for both blunt satire and heartfelt moments.2. Speaking of which, the best episodes do hit close to home. The Simpsons financial difficulties, Bart caught stealing a game, Homer and Marge settling with their lot in life. My favorite one is where Lisa makes friends on vacation. It reminded me so much of those one-week friendships I'd make every summer. Sadly, most of these serious episodes are only in the first half of the franchise.3. The Simpson's best trait is the one that's the least tangible. Its just plain funny. Balanced in timing and variety, even the bad episodes elicit chuckles. I just like this style.THE WORST1. This is the show that brought us the term ""Flanderization"" - where characters become simplified and exaggerated as a show goes on. Ned Flanders, for example, started off as an ideal, friendly neighbor, but devolved into a friendly, paranoid religious nut. Most characters undergo this change. Admittedly, it does give some characters more personality, but for others, it severely damages their character. The worst example of this is Patty and Selma. They've always disliked Homer, but now its canon that they kidnapped and attempted to murder him. I'm serious.2. As if you can talk about canon in The Simpsons. They haven't aged a day in 25 years. The vast majority of episodes exist in a vacuum. Thus you'll never have character development beyond the half hour of each episode. Since nothing changes, a lot of themes have to be reused. Expect a lot of episodes where Homer and Marge kiss and makeup, Lisa makes friends, or Bart bites off more than he can chew. They'll never learn their lessons forever, which is frustrating on the macro scale.3. I dislike most episodes that completely drop the character and satire. They're just pure cartoons, something the typical episode of The Simpsons would criticize. I skip every ""The Simpsons Go To X!"" episode (And no, Bart vs. Australia isn't the ""good one""! >:I), classic stories with Simpsons characters forced in, and most of the Treehouse of Horrors.Those are my thoughts. If you are the lone person whose curious about the show, watch any episode that's airing at the moment. If you like what you see, then you can use the web to find the best episodes. They're on Hulu, so you can check the highest scoring entries on IMDb and see them yourself.","7","20 August 2014"

"181","If it wasn't for my daily dose of the Simpson's I'd go insane! Television, in my view, is getting worse in many ways but I can still rely on my 6 o'clock showing of the best television ever! (until it moves to channel 4.... they better show it at six!!!)Anyway, my love for the Simpson's has been since day one really, I remember watching the first season on videos back in 1990... (we didn't have Sky).I think what's great about the Simpson's is that it can appeal to everyone. When you're a kid you idolize Bart but when you get older you realize the best character within the family is Homer by a long long long stretch!My favorite characters tend to be the support like Moe, Skinner, Lenny and my all time favorites Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure... Phil Hartman, we miss you!Nothing can beat the 1992-1999 era where most episodes were pretty damn good... but now the are declining in quality which makes me think whether after the contract runs out in 2005 it should be time to end this show (hopefully with a feature length!)Either way the Simpson's over the years have gone beyond being just a cartoon but is now a review on modern culture10 out of 10",NA,"19 June 2003"
"182","To me, the first nine seasons the Simpsons is one of the greatest times in TV history, and no, I'm not waxing nostalgia, I'm saying this because the show Groening and Co created was not only a smart and entertaining body of work, but it also did it with likable characters you could empathize with and great stories to boot.However, as all good things must come to an end, the ""Great"" years of the show stopped as soon as the powers that be decided to dumb it down to make it a show that's more family (and ratings) friendly (season 10 and beyond). Combined with a total lack of regard of competent storytelling, horrible puns, dated storytelling and the new sterile HD switch the past few seasons are existing only on the show's popular name.","7","19 September 2009"
"183","This show once was one of the best shows ever. Now is painful to watch, dumb, nonsense humor, not funny at all. The worst thing is how awesome it was time before","7","20 January 2020"
"184","When it first came along, ""The Simpsons"" took the world by storm, because it was not only hilarious and sincere all at once, but also unique. Whoever heard of an animated sitcom about a normal suburban family, without superpowers or giant talking animals or anything like that? It was unthinkable. Matt Groening's world sucked everyone in simply because it rang true... remember the now-famous adage, ""There's a Simpson in all of us?"" well, it was true, we loved the series because we identified so well with the characters. We could laugh at our own faults and troubles, and forget about them all at once. I always thought it was a LITTLE overrated, but it was still very good. I practically grew up with them. Sure, its sudden success produced the inevitable morass of bad ripoffs, parodies and tributes, everyone trying to jump on the bandwagon and attempt to capture just what made it unique, butthe Simpsons still stood in a class all its own. But a happy ending wasn't to be. In the grand tradition of so many of the greatest TV shows of all time (""Are You Being Served?""), the Simpsons' writers did the inevitable: They ran out of ideas. Suddenly they were recycling jokes, becoming steadily more offbeat with their humor, and writing plot lines that tried way too hard to be funny and wound up just being stupid. Before long it felt that each episode was being written by committee. I still remember, during December of 1998, praying to God to please, let the series die a dignified death, just have them make one last FANTASTIC final episode and let that be it, don't make them keep dragging it out for another 9 years after it runs out of juice, please... But that wasn't to be, either. Instead they've done exactly that, they've propped it up for years and years past its lifetime. A moment of silence if you please.It used to be one of the best shows on TV, back when it was actually somewhat original.","7","28 November 2004"
"185","Okay, maybe I was too harsh when I said that, but the truth is, this show is, in fact, extremely overrated. Don't get me wrong, I USED to love it, but now it's getting old; as in it should've never even entered the 21st century.To start off, I'm very unimpressed with the animation. It's dull and tacky; and where's the vibrancy? Plus most of the character movements are forced, particularly the facial expressions of Marge Simpson and ""Comic Book Guy"" (who came up with these names?); to be honest, it looks as if this show is made on the cheap. I may or may not be the only one to complain about this, but the characters' skins are mostly yellow while others are brown, which indicates a pinch of laziness, and it certainly doesn't help that color's all over the place. Even ""101 Dalmations: The Series"" had better animation than this, and yet it was low-budget for goodness sake.The music isn't much better. The music scores and the theme songs are both kind of pleasant if unmemorable, but in general the musical numbers are poor. Maybe not as bad as those ear-bleeding songs from the ""Mr. Hankey the Christmas Poo"" episode of ""South Park"", and not as badly sung either, but it isn't saying much. I think I need to talk about the worst one. That is ""Freedom"" from that one episode where children fight against grown-ups, and in my opinion is a perfect example of complete unnessecaty, and one that's so bad it's hilarious. With the uncanny music, non-sense lyrics and horrible singing, it was bland and terrible to listen to. Which is rather pathetic, seeing how Danny Elfman has done wonderful music scores for ""Chicago"", ""Corpse Bride"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". Perhaps he's uninspired with what he has to work with.Maybe I am alone in this, but the characters aren't that very likable. Homer Simpson, instead of being the headstrong funny protagonist I keep hoping for (maybe my expectations are too high), is always dry as a cactus. Bart and Lisa are rather clichd children, and despite one being a troublemaker (Bart) and the other being smart, intelligent, and caring for the environment (Lisa), are as dried up as well, and Marge's voice is so dried up that you want to smack her in the face. Not even Maggie or any other side characters have any real charm.The episodes are, how do I put it, bad. There is very little humor in each episode, and the writing is stale and the lines clichd. You always feel as if you've seen it before, I certainly have. So much so, the side characters have very little to do in Springfield, and the dialogue is sappy and wishy-washy. If there's any comedy in an episode, it's unintentional. I am of course talking about everything -- the regulars, the two-three parters, even the ""Treehouse of Horror"" specials. The endings leave me dissatisfied, not only 'cause they are all happy endings but also 'cause it makes each episodes feel rather abrupt.But as the characters are lifeless and unengaging, same applies to the voice acting. While most of the voices are annoying, others have few points of energy to carry on an episode. Dan Castellaneta tries his best playing Homer, Grandpa Abe, Groundskeeper Willie, and so many others, but is always hampered down by the material he's given. Same applies to Yeardley Smith as Lisa. Most of the actors, like Julie Kavner as Marge, Patty and Selma, Harry Shearer as Ned Flanders, and Tress MacNielle as several females read their lines as if they're reading out of a story book, and believe me, that's quite boring. Nancy Cartwright appears to be the only one having fun, but, like Castellaneta, is given so much to do as Bart, Ralph Wiggum, Todd Flanders, etc.Overall, this show is mediocre. It's not terrible, but bland. **** out of **********.","7","21 June 2012"

"188","This is one of, if not the best show there has been in the history in television, especially from America. The greatest cartoon ever made started in 1989, and it's still going on. The Simpsons are the family that live in the town of Springfield. The Simpsons family is a 10-year-old son, Bart; an 8-year-old daughter, Lisa; a baby daughter, Maggie; a mother and wife, Marge; and of course, television and the programme's greatest character, the stupid, lazy, sometimes rude and disgusting father/husband, Homer Simpson. Throughout the show the family have many weird and wonderful adventures, happenings and goings on. All funny, lovable and brilliant stories are what keep the show going. Homer is obviously the biggest story maker of the show. There are also some lovable characters in the extended family and neighbourhood to like, including Abraham ""Grampa"" Simpson, Patty and Selma, Santa's Little Helper and Snowball II, The Flanders: Ned, Maude, Rod and Todd, Milhouse Van Houten, Apu, Ralph Wiggum, Chief Clancy Wiggum, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Martin Prince, Reverand Lovejoy, Nelson Muntz, Cletus and Brandine, Mr. Charles Montgomery Burns and Waylon Smithers, Lenny and Carl, Principal Seymour Skinner, Superintendent Chalmers, Edna Krabappel, Grounsdkeeper Willie, Otto Mann, Jimbo, Dolph, Kearney, Mayor ""Diamond Joe"" Quimby, Snake, Fat Tony, Comic Book Guy, Sea Captain (MacCallister), Lionel Hutz, Squeaky Voiced Teen, Professor Frink, Hans Moleman, Krusty the Clown, Itchy and Scratchy (in TV cartoons), Kent Brockman, Troy McClure, Rainier Wolfcastle (who plays McBain), Bleeding Gums Murphy, Moe the bartender, Barney Gumble, Dr. Nick Riviera, Dr. Marvin Monroe, and many more. Stars of these voices are Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, This Is Spinal Tap's Harry Shearer, Hank Azaria, Pamela Hayden, Tress MacNeille, Marcia Wallace, Maggie Roswell, Russi Taylor, Joe Mantegna and Phil Hartman (till his death).The other reason the show is so popular is that it is the cartoon sitcom with the most celebrity appearances. These include: Kelsey Grammar as 'Sideshow Bob', James Earl Jones, Jon Lovitz, Danny DeVito as Herbert Powell (Homer's half-brother), Frank Welker, Ringo Starr, Dustin Hoffman, Sting, Bob Hope, Sir Tom Jones, Bette Midler, Hugh Hefner, Dame Elizabeth Taylor (as herself and Maggie (once), Brooke Shields, Barry White, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sam Neill, James Woods, Kathleen Turner, James Taylor, Winona Ryder, Meryl Streep, Woody Harrelson, Patrick Stewart, Mel Brooks, Susan Sarandon, Sir Paul McCartney, Glenn Close as Homer's Mom, Donald Sutherland, Kirk Douglas, Jeff Goldblum, Christina Ricci, Johnny Cash, David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Jack Lemmon, Willem Dafoe, Martin Sheen, Jay Leno, Helen Hunt, Rod Steiger, Bono, Steve Martin, Lisa Kudrow, Robert Englund, Jerry Springer, Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger, Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Mark Hamill, Sir Elton John, Stephen Hawking, Mel Gibson, John Goodman, Tim Robbins, Britney Spears, Jim Cummings, Parker Posey, Gary Coleman, Buzz Aldrin, Stephen King, Drew Barrymore, Michael Keaton, Serena and Venus Williams, Justin Timberlake, Pierce Brosnan, Matthew Perry, Paul Newman, Richard Gere, Delroy Lindo, Ben Stiller, Reese Witherspoon, Stan Lee, Carmen Electra, Elvis Costello, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Tony Bennett, Burt Ward, Adam West, Elliot Gould, Pamela Reed, Tony Hawk, Helen Fielding, James L.

Macy, Michael York, Ricky Gervais (who also wrote his episode), Joe Pantoliano and so many more.If you've never watched this, you should, it is just the most outstanding cartoon and sitcom ever created. Winner of and nominated for numerous awards including 3 British Comedy Awards, 6 ASCAP Film and TV Music Awards, 23 Annie Awards and 20 Emmys, through seventeen years on TV! A movie will be coming out in 2007! It was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, it was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments (for all Christmas episodes), it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters (for Homer Simpson), it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows, and of course, it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!","10","9 May 2005"
"189","I like this show, but...Matt Groening and company really got carried away with the celebrity cameos. I watch ""The Simpsons"" for its FANTASY element, because it takes place in a world that never was - not so I can see yellow-skinned, lipless versions of the REAL world's movers and shakers.Tony Bennett, Aerosmith, Linda Ronstadt, Adam West, Leonard Nimoy, George Harrison, Johnny Carson, Elizabeth Taylor, Luke Perry, Mel Brooks, Bono from U2, Ron Howard, Mel Gibson, Britney Spears...arrggh! It's not that I don't like these people, but their overexposed mugs belong in live action and not in cartoons! I watch ""The Simpsons"" as a means of escape from reality, so it's frustrating that I get reality shoved right in my face about 75 percent of the time when I watch this show.The really annoying episodes are the ones where the celebrity's name is said over and over and we're supposed to be entertained just because that person is famous. ""Gasp! It's James Woods!"" ""Oh my God, it's Kim Basinger!"" ""Wow! It's 'N Sync!"" (actually said TWICE, by Milhouse) Give me a freaking break! True, celebrities have made cameos on other cartoon shows; but at least then they had the good taste to play satirical versions of themselves (like ""Ann Margrock"" on ""The Flintstones"").In closing, let me just say that ""The Simpsons"" would be a perfect show if it weren't for all these celebrities shamelessly self-promoting themselves. I don't mind the celebrities, but I wish they would play fictional characters and not themselves. Then the pristine atmosphere of Springfield could be protected from the incursions of modern American life. ""The Simpsons"" is a fantasy - and it should remain that way.Oh, and one more thing: I wish they would shut up about what state Springfield is in! NOBODY CARES!All that aside...I really like ""The Simpsons.""",NA,"27 April 2002"
"190","I rate this show 10/10 based of the first 9 seasons. It was witty, it had so much heart, it was hilarious and the stories were good enough that even if you have seen an episode 10 times and know every joke, you can still enjoy it just because of the plot. The characters were great, the show had such a great balance between humor and emotion. Now, if I were to include anything past those season, specially the current ones, I'd probably give the show a 6, if you think about it, the golden era is only one quarter of the show now, meaning that 75% of the show goes from enjoyable or watchable to terribly boring and underwhelming. I wish this show had followed on Jerry Seinfeld's footsteps who knew when to end his show and went out on a high note. Both shows started in the same year and I have always felt they had a similar evolution through the years until Seinfeld ended. Then The Simpsons came out with their 10th season and although enjoyable the decline in quality was noticeable.I just wish there was a way to separate the eras of the show and rate them accordingly.","10","7 October 2018"
"191","this cartoon is the best cartoon in the world. It's the longest running animation series since the Flintsones,and now on its tenth series its shows seem to be getting better and better. I think when the cartoon first started in 1989 (in its own show) the cartoon was aimed at children but as it's come on, the storylines have quite a lot of adult references which to me makes it more funny",NA,"24 November 1998"
"192","It does not seem as long as over two decades ago since 'The Simpsons' bounced onto our television screens. The yellow skinned cartoon family from the fictional American town of Springfield first appeared on Fox's long forgotten 'The Tracey Ullman Show' from 1986 to 1989. These crudely designed skits created by Matt Groening saw the eccentric family enacting various activities, such as taking a trip to the zoo or going fishing and proved to be the most popular part of the show ( though when 'The Tracey Ullman Show' was screened in Britain, 'The Simpsons' sketches were not included as the controllers at BBC Television thought the sketches were too strange to find an audience in Britain. What? Stranger than 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' or 'The Young Ones'? Surely not! ) so thoughts turned towards developing the characters into a sitcom format. In December 1989, 'The Simpsons' kicked off with 'Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire'. It caught on immediately and from there has since notched up 574 episodes between 26 seasons as well as a feature length film, which went on release in 2007.The head of the dysfunctional Simpson family is Homer, a drunken, bumbling idiot who when not filling his face with donuts or swilling bottles of Duff beer at Moe's Tavern is to be found slacking from his work at the Springfield Power Plant. His wife is Marge - tall, husky voiced and with a huge blue bouffant hairstyle. They also have three children - 10 year old tearaway Bart, 8 year old brain box Lisa, and baby Maggie. The plots each week would normally focus on a perfectly normal situation escalating into total surrealism and like most American sitcoms, 'The Simpsons' was loud, daring and incredibly corny, yet was frequently hilarious. Homer and Bart proved the most popular with viewers, the latter for providing much of the visual humour with his mischievous ( and often dangerous ) antics and the former getting many of the laughs by either destroying everything he touched, saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, or simply just standing and looking bewildered. Homer's ''D'oh!'' catchphrase ( usually yelled when something or someone caused him to come a cropper ) to this day is still used worldwide.As 'The Simpsons' steadily rose in popularity, supporting characters such as bumbling school headmaster Principal Seymour Skinner, inept policeman Chief Wiggum and his mentally disturbed son Ralph, sleazy barman Moe, Homer's slobbish drinking buddy Barney Gumble, devious children's television presenter Krusty The Clown, Kwik-E-Mart proprietor Apu ( ''Thank you, come again!'' ), Homer's senile father Grandpa Abe Simpson, luckless Hans Moleman and white bearded pensioner Jasper Beardly became just as much an integral part of the show as Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie did. Also brilliant were the 'Itchy & Scratchy' sequences ( which were shown as sketches on Krusty's television show ) in which a cat and mouse would try to knock ten bells out of each other, with the cat inevitably getting brutally killed. The idea for 'Itchy & Scratchy' was clearly influenced by William Hannah and Joseph Barbera's animated classic, 'Tom & Jerry'.Many well known celebrities lent their voices to the show such as Danny DeVito, Elizabeth Taylor, Bette Midler, Robert Wagner, the late Gary Coleman, Sting, Mick Jagger, Britney Spears and, surprisingly, Professor Stephen Hawking! Aerosmith and U2 also joined in the fun.My favourite episodes included 'You Only Move Twice' ( Homer moves to Cyprus Creek when he is offered a well paying job there ), 'Flaming Moe's' ( Moe steals the recipe of an alcoholic drink which Homer invented ), 'Itchy & Scratchy Land' ( the family take a trip to a theme park dedicated to their favourite cartoon characters ), 'One Fish, Two Fish, Bluefish, Blowfish' ( Homer consumes a poisonous blowfish and thinks he only has 24 hours left to live ), 'Bart Gets An F' ( Bart is warned by his teacher that he will be held back another year if he fails his history test ), 'Homie The Clown' ( Homer gets a job as a Krusty The Clown double ), 'Bart After Darkness' ( Bart is given a job working in a burlesque house ). Best of all was 'Das Bus' in which the pupils of Springfield Elementary school end up washed up on a remote desert island after their school bus crashes over a bridge. The Halloween specials ( usually titled 'Treehouse Of Horror' ) were classics in their own right too. Full marks must not only go to Matt Groening for creating the show and its characters, but also to the voices behind the characters - Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright and Yeardley Smith among many others.Two and a half decades on, the show's status as a comedy classic remains untarnished, which is testament to the genius of its creator. Groening later followed up 'The Simpsons' with 'Futurama', an animated period piece sitcom set in the year 3000. Though it build up a large and loyal following, it was never in any danger of eclipsing 'The Simpsons' in terms of popularity.","10","24 June 2015"

Now with over 300 episodes The Simpsons are still carrying on with the show.","10","11 June 2003"
"197","It was inevitable that the show would change; in fact, it's been changing since season 1.  But after Season 12, the show hit a brick wall.  Each episode was carefully strained to filter out all but the most unintelligent and unfunny remarks and stretched them out as far as possible, filling everything in between with previous show references.  There's just nothing there anymore, and it's terribly sad to see what the show has become when you see what is used to be.I would refer to the show's golden years as the end of season 2 through somewhere inside season 6.  This is when the show was truly funny. Afterwards, until around season 11 or so, the show was still funny and had a charm you couldn't find anywhere else, they just weren't the best of the best anymore.  My favorite episodes are ""Selma's Choice"" and ""Last Exit to Springfield,' although perhaps the ""strange"" season 4-type humor is more my cup of tea than the ""stupid Homer doing stupid things"" humor that later became the show's trademark.In a few interviews I've read, somebody always comments that the show is getting harder and harder to make because it's becoming impossible to find stories that haven't been done already.  In my opinion, most viewers don't care what story you give them, as long as it has consistently strong jokes; I believe the strength of the former makes up better for weakness of the latter, an opinion the writers don't share.  Speaking of writers, some should be hired who actually care about the show.  Recently, it seems like more and more film and genre spoofs (i.e., having the characters watch a movie or show) are required to garner a laugh.  The educational films have always been a high point, but when the writers are using them so often it seems like they need a break from the show, they should be given just that. If you can't make up something funny within the context that has been established for this show, you need to find another show to write for. Also, recently many self-referential comments have been made about the declining quality of the show (Marge once comments, ""Well, I think it's good when a show goes off the air before it becomes stale and repetitive,' and the abrupt scene cut suggests it was a punch line) that are barely hidden and hit you on the head with a hammer to make their point.  If the writers realize how bad the show is getting, why don't they work on making it stronger rather than using the situation to wring a cheap joke from every now and then?The key to the show's undoing is the change in characters.  It's hard to believe the early and later prototypes are characters from the same show. Bart was a mischievous but loveable kid, the kind of 10-year-old you wouldn't mind having, with an affection for A Clockwork Orange and Three Stooges impersonations; he turned into a graffiti-loving, hopelessly stupid, whiny brat who relishes the thought of becoming a juvenile delinquent and can't tell the difference between right and wrong.  Lisa, the change of whom aggravates me the most, was an intelligent, girlishly cute, usually morally correct 8-year-old who stood up for her beliefs but was mostly concerned with being a kid; she transformed into an annoying, self-righteous, loud-mouthed brainiac who refuses to let anyone else harbor their own opinion and drives home the point long after anyone cares, both on and off screen.  Marge has probably changed the least; she has always been the glue that held the family together, the voice of reason, the ideal embodiment of mom and wife; my only real complaint is that she does display, more and more often, bad habits she has naggingly attempted to rid the family of for the show's run.And, of course, there's Homer.The most pivotal character in this franchise.  He was a dumb but good-hearted man, who lived for life's simpler pleasures.  He loved his family and showed it.  He didn't mean to be cruel, or lazy, or self-interested, but often his stupidity prevented him from seeing what the problems with these things were until it was too late.  Not so in the later seasons.  Homer became not only stupid, but a stupid jerk.  He indulged himself no matter what the cost to others, he openly admitted his disinterest for anyone but himself, and his aversion to work was more powerful than his desire to prove that his family was worth any effort.  I will never see this as Homer Simpson.  His comments have become much too formulaic.  How many recent jokes have there been in which Homer would say a sentence, and then repeat the last word of that sentence with more emphasis? (""I told you, my memory is fuzzy.  FUH-ZZY!"")  Ax plus By does not equal comedy, I'm sorry to say.  I wish it were, then I might still find this show funny.  And the writers have been attempting to give him lines meant for Ralph Wiggum; coming from Homer, they just don't work.
The show cut and dropped and added and substituted until there was nothing left.  In its heyday it was the best, the ONLY thing out there; nothing else could ever touch the greatness of the aforementioned golden years. Unfortunately, the shows of that era have long since wandered off and disappeared into a thick forest of season 9+ episodes, and it's a rarity to catch them anymore.  9 out of 10 times, you're going to see an episode you just saw last month, and the month before that, and the month before that, and that's a real shame and a waste of good episodes.  I hope they go soon return to the times that made the show what it was; when they are forgotten, this becomes just another blip on the sequence of images as you flip through channels in a futile attempt to find something decent.",NA,"26 October 2002"

"199","At over 20 years old, ""The Simpsons"" is wonderful, but it really would not be tragic if it were it to end. I remember that I would pretty much watch every episode when it used to air on BBC2 and there are some episodes of which I may still have a near-recital worthy knowledge. What consistently set the first ten or so seasons of the show apart from similar things (such as ""Family Guy"" and ""South Park"", which aren't all that bad themselves) was that it went beyond being a completely noisy and comical affair full of funny slapstick and cultural references and turned into something that one could truly relate to, more so than the average American sitcom. Yet I have to admit that, due to its age, it doesn't have the same kind of vitality that it once did. Don't get me wrong; it's still one of my favourites, but its run is truly miraculous enough as it is and it will still go down favourably in geeky television history.","9","2 March 2010"

"203","The reason i have voted a 1 is because i'm not actually referring to the original few series of the Simpson's, i'm referring to the last 2 or 3, i have nothing against the first 10 or so seasons, they were all great and perfectly original but since the start of the new millennium the Simpson's have rapidly become one of the unfunniest animated shows on TV to date.And why not, when the public is exposed to such hilarity as Family Guy, South Park, Drawn together, and yes even the wonderfully colourful antics of Fairly Odd Parents, you start to see how uncreative and unoriginal the Simpson's have really become.i watched 4 newish episodes of the Simpson's in a row on Sunday 2nd July on Sky One's Sunday send-off dedicated to Malcolm In the Middle and 24 and no offence Matt Groening but the first 45 seconds of the final Malcomme in the middle was funnier than all four of those episodes together, this is no joke.I'd like to point out the following mistakes I have noticed with the last 3-5 seasons of the Simpson's.1. There have only been 2 episodes where Lisa picks up a saxophone but a whole lot of others where we see her playing an instrument she's never owned.2. In the last two seasons of the Simpson's, i have failed to see where the ending of each episode actually happens, what we are given are pointless and improper endings compared to the real endings of the 1990's, where are the endings? 3. There is an ever increasing AGF around the Simpson's (Anti-Growth-Field) some of the noticeable things are A. there was a new episode in the late 90's showing a flashback of when Bart was born in 1982, how can he be born in 1982 when he's still 10.B. There have been numerous Birthdays, Summer holidays etc in the Simpson's yet for some reason they haven't aged and haven't moved on in grade.C. On Lisa's last birthday homer did something to upset her and she said ""dad, you've had 8 years to get to know me, it's too late now"", so what's happened is that she's just had a birthday but she is in fact still 8 years old.D. Perhaps the most recent flaw with the age factor is the discovery of Snake's son who is currently Bart's age, well Mr world class animated show writer, i'd like you to explain to me how that's even possible, if any of you so called writers have paid attention to the show, you'll see why i don't find this feasible.E. why is it that Maggie is still in nappies, there were hints that she was getting older in the 1st series and then it all just kinda stopped from there, notice that Apu's children who were all born in around the 10th season are all now walking, talking and have full heads of hair yet Maggie cant talk and can barely walk although she was born before them, unless Asians have a gene which makes them grow faster, which is highly unlikely, also you'll notice that sideshow bob now has a son, who by the looks of it is at least 4 years old, don't tell me this isn't a flaw.F. a recent episode includes Marge writing a book and within this episode appears Dr. Marvin Munroe ""Dr.Marvin Munroe, i haven't seen you in years"" you'd think it had only been weeks since the AGF is still surrounding you all.4. Has anyone seen where all the characters have gone, recently i've seen a dramatic decline of characters featuring in any episode even for a moment, and when they do it's just as a pointless side joke.5. Why doesn't homer have a job anymore? 6. What happened to the Leftorium? 7. Where the hell is Otto? 8. Why doesn't Smithers admit he's gay? i cant think of anymore things to point out at the moment but i'm sure they'll come to me.i'm not saying that the Simpson's is a bad show, i just think that it's tasteless puns, pointless story lines and disappearing acts in terms of characters is starting to ruin whatever fame the Simpson's had before, and if it doesn't change soon then i don't think there'll be any line for the new movie when it premiers.if you have any complaints about my comments then just email me at this address.therubixtheory@hotmail.co.ukand if you can, please tell me where i can send a letter to Matt groening, i've been dying to tell him what i think.","1","3 July 2006"

"205","When Matt Groening first introduced the world to his dysfunctional animated family the Simpsons on the Tracey Ullman show during the 1980's, it wasn't clear as to what the show was really trying to do. Beginning as crudely drawn five-minute sketches, the bizarre cartoon was a little quirky for most audiences, and didn't receive a lot of attention. It was not until Fox Network gave the yellow, three-fingered family their own television show that popularity began to ensue. Now, well into its seventeenth season, ""The Simpsons"" has done what no other television series has ever been able to do before or since. Not only is the show undoubtedly history's most successful animated series, and not only has it set amazing standards for hilarity and poignancy in the television industry, but it alone, of all the shows in the history of the world, has managed to traverse the gap between entertainment and iconic status of a first degree. It alone can be held on a pedestal above all others, because it has become beyond classic, beyond renowned. ""The Simpsons"" has indeed become so embedded in the fiber of Western culture that it can no more be considered just a cartoon than the Beatles could be considered just a band or James Dean could be considered just an actor.Groening's take on not only the dysfunctional American domestication but the entire American society begins with the titular family, of course. Homer (Dan Castellaneta), the dim-witted but lovable father, Marge (Julie Kavner), the sensible but a little over-conservative mother, Lisa (Yeardley Smith), the supremely intelligent and sensitive 8 year old daughter, Bart (Nancy Cartwright), the hell-raising but overly good-natured 10 year-old son, and Maggie, the silent but observant baby. These five characters are the primary mediums with which the show's creators dish out their scathing critique of America and the rest of the world with fantastic wit, but one of the beautiful things about The Simpsons is the vast and rich spread of stereotypical caricatures the creators have to choose from in the family's hometown of Springfield. Not only does the town appear to represent all that is wrong with American society, but nearly every character serves as a representative of an aspect of that flawed society, from Moe Sizlac (Hank Azaria), the miserable bartender, to Ned Flanders (Harry Shearer), the Simpsons' uber-Christian, nice but condescending neighbor, to Krusty The Clown (Castellaneta), the substance-abusing and emotionally damaged children's entertainer, to the town's evil, monopolizing capitalist millionaire, Mr. Burns (Shearer). The list continues with many other instantly recognizable characters used to attack the legal system, political corruption, education, environmentalism, sexuality, bureaucracy, consumerism, celebrities, pop-culture, American values, you name it, they've mocked it. But despite the fierce disdain that one could perceive lies at the heart of the show, The Simpsons rarely comes across as snide or nasty, because the writers are willing to accept that the joke is just as much on them as on any one else.This self-awareness is one of the things that make the world of ""The Simpsons"" such a comfortable and accessible place; the characters are so extreme that it becomes obvious to most audiences that the humor is based also on the ridiculous caricatures of the subject matter as much as the subject matter itself. It is in this respect that the voice talents for The Simpsons, as much as the writers, make the material rise to practically unimaginable heights of hilarity. Creating an entire town of people with only a handful of actors would have been a daunting task for some, but thanks to this infinitely gifted cast, almost every member of Springfield has become a delightfully unique and celebrated personality. The three most astounding of the actors involved in giving voice to assorted Springfield-ers are Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria, who all do some dozen characters each, and probably have the most famous voices in television history. It is because of these actors, and these actors alone, that the more slapstick humor of the show is as funny as it is, as well as the stand-alone, nonsensical jokes that only serve the purpose of cheating the audience out of an expected and typical outcome. However, the more Monty Python-esquire aspects of The Simpsons are skillfully interspersed with what can be called without question some of the cleverest humor seen on television in years.It is in simple jokes such as a historical park having recently changed management putting up a sign that reads ""Sorry, but there's profit to be had"" or a wistful Homer telling his little boy in a loving tone that ""If something's hard to do then it's not worth doing"" that the reason for The Simpsons' deserved stature lies. The show-runners could have, at any time, copped out and made their series a collection of jokes about the stupidity of an American father or the antics of a rebellious son, but instead they made it meaningful and poignant. It is for this reason that whatever happens to the show now, whether it declines into dismally low ratings and is cancelled for lack of interest or gets its second wind and comes back strong with the best we've seen yet, ""The Simpsons"" will always be the absolute and undeniable epitome of television entertainment.","10","8 December 2005"
"206","Okay, back when the Simpsons aired in 1989 off the Tracy Ulman show (premeired 1992 in Hong Kong), it was one of the most wonderful, funny and poignatic show. Sure there might have been some mild profanity and crude humor, but it seemed like just about everyone enjoyed it. I felt like adopting the Simpsons as a second family.......... ..........Until after 1997, after the death of Phil Hartman, it seemed to really sink low and be more aimed for the ""Teen Crowd"". I also hate how the characters got REAL personallity face-lifts. Come on, Barny becoming sober? Sideshow Bob becoming evil AGAIN (despite the fact that was brother was mentioned was another head scratcher)? Bart Simpson driving a tank? What the.......? This is just blowing my mind. I also hate how Homer became from lovable dumb lug with a short fuse to being a crazed fame-thirsty jerk. I also hate the Lisa Simpson makeover too. She used to be my favorite character with alot of good advice to give out. Now, she's a total crazy stereotypical hippy! And didn't Bart used to be more miscievious? Don't get me started with the episodes with Brittany Spears or N'Synch either!!!
I just wished that Matt Groening would focus on more projects (eg. Futurama)......-_-*SIGH* Those were the days......",NA,"4 March 2002"
"207","I love this show.Well-drawn characters, dead-on dialogue,  literate allusions and a hilariously subversive perspective make this the best half-hour on television.  These talented people don't make a throw-away episode. Devastatingly observant and incisive, The Simpsons says more about morality and the virtues and downfalls of American society than any of those so-called ""uplifting"" or ""life-affirming"" shows (you know, they usually involve angels). Somehow this show manages to be both high-brow and low-brow at the same time.  The laughs come from all directions, and resonate for hours afterward.   Like other great television shows from The Mary Tyler Moore Show to Seinfeld, the best laughs come from strong witty characterization and a skillful ensemble cast.Though animated, the characters inhabiting Springfield seem more recognizable and alive than those in most live-action shows on television today.  I suggest that the Emmys add a category, in Phil Hartman's memory, for best voice performance and award it to a different Simpson's voice artist every year.  Then they can start from the beginning and go through the cast again.  Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Nancy Cartwright (ha ha), Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner....... these people voice vibrant human life into the Springfield community each week.I hope this show goes on forever at the same level of quality it has maintained for the past ten years.  Already classic television, The Simpsons deserves to be enshrined in television history.",NA,"12 December 1998"
"208","Grew up with this show and remember sneaking to watch it, and now I have to keep my kids from watching it. It is definitely adult, and not for young kids however it isn't as bad as American Dad, or South Park. It is a show that survives by making paritys of current events using the Simpsons universe. However it has a atheist under tone with a lot of fun poked at Christianity.","8","28 January 2022"
"209","When the core writing staff left The Simpsons for Futurama, the show changed beyond recognition. It's been all downhill since. This rating started much higher, but The Simpsons has been terrible for three times longer than it was good. Every year it stays on the air does more damage to the reputation it earned in those early seasons.","4","21 November 2020"
"210","What can I say, The Simpsons is in my opinion, the greatest show of all time. The skits and jokes work on so many levels. Even the so-called ""bad"" episodes at least have a few great gags in them. I remember in most of primary school (I'm 14 now) I hated this show. I started liking this show pretty late compared to others around me. I would always criticise people for liking this show, saying that it was for idiots. This all changed one day when my best friend told me to watch it for once. Although I can't remember the episode I watched, I really enjoyed it. So I watched it for the next few nights. I was hooked! Sometimes I have this thing called the ""Simpsons drought"" where for some reason I don't watch it at all for maybe six months for no apparent reason. I finished my last drought early last year. Since then, I have tuned in every night at 6:00 (I live in Australia) and also tune into all the new episodes.The most obvious aspect of The Simpsons to fans is its unfortunate decline. It starts to get a bit rotten around late season 9 with a fair amount of good episodes in season 10 and beyond.Every episode revolves around a different character which makes it even more exciting. The characters are classics. I am so proud of the writers and directors of The Simpsons. Just for the record, this show is not just for children and teens. It is meant for every age group. Sometimes the writers like to get a little cheeky and add a little hidden joke about sex or something. Overall, this show is gold.I love The Simpsons!","10","1 April 2007"
"211","I think for most of us that if The Simpsons ended far earlier it would be without question a 10/10 show, and really it pains me not to be able to credit the amazing early work with the score it truly deserves since i'm technically reviewing the show as a whole and not just the parts I want to.I'm a very lenient person, for many the series was killed at Season 9 Episode 2 why this specific episode? They took a beloved character and turned his entire backstory into a lie, 9 seasons leading up to this point and all ruined in one moment. I completely get why that is the turning point for many, and I agree that it definitely was a turning point. But I do think that there were still some great episodes after that right up until as far as season 14 admittedly they were becoming few and far in between at that point.Even listening to the dvd commentaries you can tell the difference, they lose several writers and contributers and they slowly seem to lose the enthusiasm as the series wears on. After all they're not up to about 30 seasons, and to be honest even I haven't been able to stick through all of the episodes just yet. I do recommend watching the episodes with commentary, it makes you appreciate the early episodes that much more. You even discover more jokes and references that are very obscure or hard to pick up on. It's for that reason that I still rate it this highly despite over half of the episodes being nowhere near that standard, and the fact that it would be criminal to rate it very low considering the amazing episodes it did give to us. In a perfect world it would have ended after season 14 and Futurama would never have been cancelled as early as it was.","8","31 May 2019"
"212","The Simpsons started off amazing but after season 9 the show slowly got worse and worse. The newest episodes just don't have that zing the older ones did. That's why I give it a 6/10.","6","11 September 2021"
"213","The Simpson's has gotten to a point where they have truly run out of ideas and instead of being funny it's just weird.My friend agrees with me that if they aged the characters, for example Bart and Lisa up to High school and Maggie into elementary school then the show would gain some freshness to it.Think about it, it could open the door for some new characters to come along and we could still have Principal skinner and Miss Hoover and Willie and the rest. But it could give them the opportunity to give the show some credibility in it's final years.I long for the day when I can say ""The Simpson's Have got it back again!""",NA,"28 April 2005"
"214","To me, it's hard to picture life without The Simpsons. All the sub-personalities that compose my dark side get permission to live and breathe when I watch that show. Everything that can possibly go wrong does, and it makes me so happy that it's happening to them instead of me. Of course, it's a bit disconcerting that Homer rarely even notices that things are constantly going wrong, but then, that frees him from taking responsibility. Oddly enough, he ends up taking responsibility by accident, which makes my inner Hallmark self happy. Marge is even more oblivious than Homer except when the day really needs to be saved, then suddenly she becomes supermom. Bart is busy trying not to be like Homer, which makes him twice as dangerous. Lisa is a perfect person, which makes it perfectly obvious how insane everyone else is. And Maggie is just an innocent baby... or IS she? I find most of the older episodes better than the newer ones, but it's still the Mad Magazine of the new millennium.","8","11 January 2007"
"215","It's hard to express how I feel about ""The Simpsons"". It's perfect on nearly every level (the only thing holding it back from reaching perfection on every level is its slight lack of morality). The characters are very well developed, the jokes are incredibly witty, and the backgrounds and props are typically pretty well designed. So why did I give it only 9 out of 10? The decline of the show's quality is the answer. Just this year, our beloved show reached a new low. A low that can only be compared to Family Guy; possibly the worst prime-time animated series ever made. Here is a best-to-worst list of all the seasons so far:season 4, season 7, season 5, season 6, season 3, season 8, season 9, season 10, season 18, season 11, season 12, season 17, season 1, season 16, season 2, season 15, season 14, season 13, and season 19Thanks for reading my review.","9","26 August 2008"
"216","when i come home in the afternoon, tired and feel like crud, there's only one thing that cheers me up: The Simpsons! is it just me or have t.v. shows reached an all time low, kid's programmes take over in the afternoon and then it's soap opera's in the evening. Comedy shows like Only fools and horses or Red Dwarf are getting less air time which leaves anyone with sense, drowning in a sea of bordness! This yellow family stay true to what television shows should be: enjoyable. marvellous puns, witty one liners and great story lines is what has kept this show running to it's 17th season. people of all ages are sucked in to the world of Springfield. Of course the characters, along with the family, are ones no-one forgets like: Chief Wiggum, Moe Syzlack, Ned Flanders, Barney Gumble and Nelson 'Ha,Ha' Muntz are to name a few, and it's never ending list of special guest stars like most recently, Ricky Gervais. People get so lost in the episodes that some even forget it's a cartoon. 'The Simpsons' has given hope to those who believe that T.V. will never return to What it once was. This truly is the Best thing on T.V.","10","28 May 2006"
"217","While it may have started off as a small segment on the Tracey Ullman show, nobody back then would have predicted that the Simpsons would go on to be the longest running cartoon of all time.Everyone's favorite four fingered family (most notably Bart the underachiever and Homer the iconic blue collared slob) have had many adventures, and with the progression of the show we can look back and see many events and trends over the past decade encapsulated in some form of another, and see how things have changed in this decades episodes.Originally the show was a humorous look at everyday life in middle American society, covering topics like religion, politics, work, and family commitment. Most of the humor was in the creative writing, which was full of intelligent jokes that compelled you to watch and re-view again to spot more intricate details (As in memorable episodes like Bart the Genius, and The Head of Jebediah Springfield).However, as time progressed the quality of humor and story continuity started to break down. Somewhere towards the end of the 90's the show's focus shifted towards zany and unrealistic situations, and became more reliant on visual and crude 'below the belt' humor. Also noticeable was the shift away from family related scenario's in favor of following the exploits of Homer's get rich quick schemes and new one-episode jobs.As a fan of the show from it's origin, it saddens me to see how the newer writers have butchered what used to be a funny show.","6","3 July 2006"
"218","One of the greatest and most influential comedy series in history.The (animated) life and times of the Simpson family - Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie - living in Springfield. Hijinks ensue.Incredibly funny, with something for all ages. Kids can relate to the what Bart and Lisa get up to and for the adults there is the clever skits and dialogue.Very influential too. While there had been animated comedies before, these were largely cartoons, involving physical comedy (think Micky Mouse, or the Roadrunner). The Simpsons brought well thought out plots, dialogue and clever humour. These effects can be seen today, in every animated comedy show. You can't watch shows like Family Guy or South Park and not think ""The Simpsons did it first!"".","10","19 December 2015"
"219","If not ""The Simpsons"" there surely wouldn't be such a great cartoons as ""Family Guy"", ""South Park"", and ""American Dad"".After so many years i still can't get enough of this family (other characters too). It's also amazing that creators still have new ideas, with so many episodes already aired, and with very big competition from other shows. I heard that people were complaining about last seasons, but i think that it's still an entertaining cartoon.I hope that they won't stop making it after releasing ""The Simpsons Movie"", cause it would be a huge waste.","10","22 June 2007"

"221","There's a lot of hate coming from people on this site, giving the show 1 star by complaining about the newer episodes. Let's look at The Simpsons as a whole, rather than focusing on certain seasons.The characters are diverse, the writing is smart, and the satire is golden. You have a whole universe within the show of Springfield residents and mayhem that goes on. Within each episode, something happens that changes everything (Homer gets a pet monkey, Bart accidentally burns down the Christmas tree, etc.) and at the end, they have to resolve it. It paints a picture of upper middle class American families and how they deal with everyday situations. A lot goes on in Springfield and some of my favorites are voiced by Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer.Overall, The Simpsons is great entertainment that is family-friendly for the most part. There's a lot to like about this show and try to focus on it as a whole series because let's admit the newer episodes aren't as good but that doesn't stop it from being an amazing show!","10","13 July 2015"
"222","I feel compelled to review The Simpsons even though this is one of hundreds of reviews and will therefore not be read. I feel compelled because I think The Simpsons is the best TV comedy series ever. To be sure there are many episodes from other comedy series that are funnier than many and perhaps even most Simpson episodes, but over the long haul -and it has been a very long haul- The Simpsons are on top the comedy meter.The early entries are not particularly funny. In fact, they are kind of odd, almost surreal. Even the appearance and animation were not yet up to snuff. The show had yet to find its stride. That took about a season. When the writers and animators finally got it going on all cylinders, the show was destined to become a classic. In my opinion it has long since left the comedies I Love Lucy, Seinfeld and Cheers behind. And aside from the somewhat annoying I Love Lucy, I thought those were great series.I do not know how many repeating characters The Simpsons have. Jimbo, Mayor Quimby, and one of my favorites, the always downtrodden Gil are just a few. There are two sets of twin sisters: Sherri and Terri who are classmates of Bart Simpson, and there are Patty and Selma, Marge Simpson's cigarette-puffing sisters.As I said, it took a season or so for the show to gain steam. It might be that in the last season or so it is beginning to lose steam. Lately there have been a few entries that have seemed a little flat and short of zing. After nearly 30 years, maybe the end is in sight. If so, it has been one helluva run.","10","24 February 2017"
"223","""The Simpsons"" never fail to make me laugh. I have been watching for years and I still get a kick out of even the re-runs.  Some people put this show down saying ""It's a cartoon so it's a T.V. show""  This is incredibly wrong, in fact this is one of the most adult shows on T.V.  I don't think kids will get the references to ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""Vertigo"".  Not only is this show hilarious but it deals with issues that other shows won't deal with like drinking and religion.  No other show shows drinking in such a bad light.  So I urge you see this show, for after one episode you to will be a ""Simpsonian"".",NA,"8 December 1998"
"224","The Simpsons is one of the funniest shows on TV today.  It is the one reason I look forward to Sunday night.  Almost every episode has two independent plots which somehow meld together in the end for a finale that is nothing short of magnificent.  While some episodes could use some work (I personally don't like the first-season), most of them are packed with comedy.",NA,"6 December 1998"
"225","My dad is the one who got me into The Simpsons. I'd like to thank him for that, because this show is great. It is definitely classic, and one of the greatest shows on TV. The cast of characters, from Bart to Homer Simpson, are incredibly funny. The show overall, is great throughout its 20 seasons, unlike many shows, and even my favorite show South Park wasn't excellent ALL the time. The first episode was what launched this show into stardom, and the first episode was awesome. So The Simpsons lays right up there with South Park, Family Guy, and Rugrats for being the greatest animated shows of all time.10/10","10","26 March 2009"
"226","I've watched The Simpsons for years and it never gets old! Maybe it's because I'm still a minor but in any case the humor is funny, as are the characters. The Simpsons are a tightly-financed family in where Homer (the father) works at a nuclear plant, Marge (wife) is a housewife, and the kids Bart and Lisa, along with the infant Maggie, who Homer forgets a lot of the time. Homer always does something goofy to screw up the family, which is the beauty of it all. DOH!",NA,"29 October 2000"
"227","by now everybody knows or everybody should know that the Simpsons is the greatest television programme ever made, it's a fact, other excellent animated shows have come such as Family Guy and South Park but none of them have been able to match the intelligence the popularity or the hilarity of the Simpsons.The Simpsons has every ingredient of a great television programme the characters are believable, three dimensional and funny.The stories are sometimes surreal and wacky but mainly they are good story lines with one simple point at the centre of them and at the end the characters learn some what of a lesson .The animation itself is something of beauty seamless and complex but superbly done.so far there have been eighteen seasons of the Simpson's and people usually tend to focus on the negatives when talking about the new episodes, i personally think that the new episodes are quite funny and when they are compared to other comedy programmes on television they hold up quite well but when they are compared to the old episodes they arr not as funny but how can people expect a programme to be as fresh and new and funny in its eighteenth season as it was when it first hit our TV screens?I cannot wait for the release of the Simpson's movie by the looks of the new trailer the Simpson's feature length adventure will captivate all the jokes and visual puns that made us laugh so hard in the early days of the Simpson's. to conclude this is the best, funniest, smartest and most interesting television programme of all time and i don't think that's going to change any time soon.","10","3 December 2006"

The Simpsons get into hilarious adventures that never disappoint. Who Shot Mr. Burns? was one of the best. Great thing to watch on Sunday nights. I admit I haven't seen all of the episodes, but the ones I have seen were hands down hilarious. I love it when I can find a descent clip of The Simpsons on YouTube, because I can sort of catch up. The Simpsons Movie is going to be the biggest Summer blockbuster this decade! Am I right? Like probably a bunch of fans, my favorite character is Homer. He is so funny and he has done so many jobs.

So, if fans hate this episode Jerry, wouldn't those numbers be going down, instead of up. I don't think you're a true fan of the show, if you think they should pull the plug. I think you should rethink what you wrote.In no number of words, can you describe such a tremendously great show like ""The Simpsons"". The longest running animated show, mind you. With over three-hundred and sixty episodes as of now. People like Jerry Brown have no clue about ""The Simpsons"". He must have two crayons shoved into his brain, instead of just one, like Homer. Even Homer is not so stupid that he would want to cancel an award winning show. Jerry Brown's observations of the show getting worse with every season is just a waste of IMDb's space, text and reading. Just from reading his input made my IQ drop.Best wishes Jerry on future comments.And again, these words are for Jerry Brown. You do not scare me!","9","20 April 2006"
"233","For years The Simpsons has remained at the top, always shrewd in its dark humor and making predictions of the future.
In recent years the animated series has been suffering a great decay. In his early seasons we saw more relationship dilemmas between Bart and Homer, the marriage of Homer and Marge, and fewer non-charismatic characters like Krusty the Clown, Moe, Edna and Skinner in focus.
In my opinion the new seasons have been repeating and becoming bland. Homer Simpson has been taken out of focus and that's no good,
Especially the 30th season was overly boring, bland and very dramatic in almost every episode of it.
But don't generalize because Season 29 was amazing, well thought out and with a brilliant last episode called Flanders Ladder (in my opinion one of the best episodes in the series).
I hope that in the coming seasons The Simpsons will be amazing again.","7","29 July 2019"

I have a dad who works hard but hates work and would just rather sit at home in front of the tube, beer in hand. I have a mother who only loves us and only wants the best for us, even if she might occasionally do something a bit stupid. Then I have an older brother who lives to make fun of my older sister and I, though we both know that he loves us. I have an older sister who's a brainiac and then there's me.

The third season until about season 10 was great with only one or two poor episodes but when season 11 started I was confused and very disappointed because there seemed to be no direction to any of the storylines some episodes just go on without you even noticing it is even on. I end up watching the old episodes form season six which are my favourite that season was the best season and a great cliff-hanger even though Maggie Simpson shooting Mr burns was a bit stupid. Season six was brilliant and so was season seven but the show started to dye during season eight but at times was still brilliant and then came 1997-1998 season which killed the programme and started of the weird trend of those weird confusing storylines. In year 2001 I saw the worst episode ever when the Simpson's went on that safari which was the final nail in the coffin. The best episodes are ones like 'last exit to Springfield' ,'deep space homer<U+0091>,' Bart vs. Australia' and who shot Mr burns part 1 which was the shows heyday.

"236","I am well and truly devoted to The Simpsons, and I have every season on DVD boxsets. Whilst season 1 is low budget, from season 2 onwards you will notice the improvements that come with the success of the show. The characters develop and evolve, the plot lines become more exciting and wacky, and the jokes just get funnier! The best thing about The Simpsons is that it is perfect for family viewing, because kids will love it, and adults will get the jokes that the kids don't understand because they're too young, so I recommend this to anyone who wants to watch hundreds of episodes of comedy gold!","10","21 June 2019"

Simply put, it was iconic, quotable, and universally loved, as the show combined humour and meaning well.Some watchers argue that the show went downhill, rapidly after about the 10th, though I'd say that there were plenty of funny episodes right up to the late teens. While there were a few good moments in the 20s, this is when The Simpsons lost its charm. It went from a timeless, quirky show to something that we need a lot less of: a jumble of pandering and meaningless drivel. It tries too hard to be hip and it's a real shame to see voice actors go after so-called 'controversy' and a few, ignorant demands.The show just isn't what it used to be.

It always focuses in interesting things, like homossexualism, gifted children, brainwashing and moneytaking religions, etc. The characters are absolutelly perfect and they force me to adore them, (in a good way) especially Lisa, who is a gifted child just like me. Many things that happen to her happened to me, too. And it usually helps me.Everybody likes this show. All my friends like The Simpsons and theyre always saying: ""The Simpsons are awesome!"".

"243","Really funny, this show is awesome. Like the time Lisa tries to teach Maggie the word ""dodecahedron"". That was funny. I didn't even know that word until 6th grade! And the Richard Nixon episodes, those were really funny. ""Yes, I would also like to express, my, fondness for that particular beer."" It's funny for all ages. Okay, maybe not kids. They don't get all the parodies. But even my grandmother loves it! And she doesn't like anything. It has all types of humor. I like the dry humor the best, like when Lisa says, ""As intelligence goes up, happiness goes down. See, I made a graph. I make a lot of graphs."" Lisa is a stereotypical smart girl, and that's what makes her funny.","8","14 August 2006"

"245","I agree that by and large, the Simpsons dont cut like they once did. But take my advice, and take soem time off from them. Trust me when you return even the newer ones will get you. Imagine our lives without this program for the last 14 years. Now imagine all the losers who have never even watched the show. My one complaint is not the much commented upon flagging of quality, its how Fox chops up the damn repeats! They lift entire segments in the name of cheap advertising. Its not damn fair!!!",NA,"13 September 2003"
"246","The Simpsons is not only one of the best animated sitcoms ever, but also an important part of the 90's.  Culture as we know it mainly rose up from the Simpsons in the past decade.  Homer Simpson represents how we are stupid and dumb, yet very likable, Marge as a always nagging person who never lets up but still is loving, Lisa as the cautious one who always there brain, and Bart as the one who doesn't.  In a nutshell, there is a little Simpson in all of us.  Or, it could be just a stupid (yet funny) TV show that always has us saying on Sunday nights ""What's On""  always satisfying. A+","10","19 July 2000"
"247","Now don't hate me but I think it's time to put this show to rest. For a cartoon sitcom it was funny and innovative in its first few years but now after seventeen years it has jumped the shark several times.The same toilet humor,gross out jokes,alien invasions ,bart doing fart jokes etc etc etc have become irritatingly repetitive and painfully unfunny.We also have a feature film of the show coming out next year.In my opinion after watching the trailer you'd be better off saving your money for a night out at the club drinking.Like most cheaply made cartoon movies it's nothing more than one long television episode,the animation is the same cheap stuff,they don't even bother to improve it for the big screen.Look at the big screen versions of Rugrats,Doug,Power Puff Girls and the Wild Thornberrys etc and you'll see what I mean, the only difference between the TV show and the movie is the size of the screen its shown on. Oh and by the way - the Cartoon Network is pumping out some of the worst animation I've ever seen. Dexters Lab,Power Puff Girls,Cow and Chicken,Johnny Bravo,Ed,Edd and Eddy - With all the money they have and they come up with this crap, a two year old could draw better and probably come up with more entertaining ideas.Nuff said -the simpsons should be canceled after this season.","8","15 December 2006"
"248","Judging TV shows is nothing like judging movies. The longer they go on, the more they change.When ""The Simpsons"" premiered in early 1990, there had been no animation in prime time since 1966. It was a huge pop culture phenomenon, but whether it would last or peter out in a few years remained to be seen. Nearly 20 years later, it is an institution. But it isn't the same show it was in 1990, 1995, or even in 2000. Because in those years it had a right to call itself the greatest show of all time. Now the show is like an old man trying to recapture the glory of his youth, and he just won't die.""The Simpsons"" of the 20th century was smart, witty, sophisticated, satirical, unconventional, and populated with memorable characters, laugh-out-loud situations and dialog, and a family dynamic that was neither idealized or vilified. Not even the best live-action sitcoms could beat it. Homer Simpson was a character like no other, a classic clown who tried hard to please his family but either screwed up or lost his temper. With the saint-like patience of his wife Marge, the moral center of the family, his arch, scheming, trouble-making son Bart, his sweet, gifted, and inquisitive daughter Lisa, and his baby daughter Maggie, and a cast of thousands (literally), the weekly trip to 742 Evergreen Terrace in Springfield, USA was an event, as if one was watching Babe Ruth hit one home run after another. But then something happened. ""The Simpsons"" of the 21st century is an embarrassing travesty.It is difficult to pinpoint the exact moment ""The Simpsons"" began its downhill slide, but Lisa's increasingly strident preaching <U+0097> manifested as early as season 4 but kept in check for a little while <U+0097> certainly didn't help. While Mike Scully allowed the episodes to become broader and allowed the tightness of the plots to slack, he was able to keep it consistently funny for awhile. But by season 11, you could see the show at its best one week and at its worst the next. Season 12 was even worse. By season 13, Al Jean, who had been with the show since day one, took over from Scully, and things have gotten even worse. Many gags are no longer funny in and of themselves. The plots are forgettable affairs that tend to evoke memories of older, better episodes. The show has sacrificed nonpartisan satire for leftist advocacy. The characters are stereotypes of stereotypes. Some recent episodes even stray into ""so-bad- they're-hilarious"" territory. What is worse is that not only do the writers seem to care, but they have responded to the increasing complaints by fans with unsubtle attacks on them. Yet they keep on with this horrific betrayal because it's still a healthy paycheck.Perhaps the show is a victim of its own success. They're far from the only game in town now. They have to compete with ""King of the Hill,"" ""South Park,"" ""Family Guy"" (the object of a silly and pointless feud), and now the return of ""Futurama"", not to mention dozens of other animated shows supposedly for adults, all of which exist because of this show's early success. The movie was the exception, though. It had real emotional pull, its jokes were mostly funny, and it made the characters seem interesting once again.When other hit shows go bad, they get canceled. If you truly love ""The Simpsons,"" you will write to Fox and ask them to put the show out of its misery so that it can die with dignity.","10","4 April 2008"
"249","I used to like this show. The key word there is I USED to like it, but it's gotten so stupid anymore that it's too late to kill it while it still has some dignity. I loved the first 7 seasons, season 8 sucked, season 9 was great, season 10 stunk (because Phil Hartman was murdered by his wife during the previous season ""sniffle"" ""sniffle"" I miss that guy! He was so funny! It sucks he's dead!), season 11 ditto, season 12 was horrible, and season 13 without a doubt is the worst one yet, but no doubt season 14 will be worse!!!It amazes me how everyone still thinks this show is still great after all of these years. It makes me want to puke so bad!! Doesn't anyone realize this show has been horrible for the last 3, or 4 years? It has cop-out endings, stupid plots (like when they go on a vacation), and more celebrity appearances than any other show can manage! This isn't ""The Simpson's"" show I remember, now it's trying to be more of a ""Family Guy"" type show (and by the way, ""Family Guy"" is a GREAT SHOW!!!) which I think is why it's gotten to where it is now. Not only that but Homer is now the main attraction of the show. I just can't figure out how they make him the subject in every episode anymore. He's an idiot who gets stupider every single year, and like one other person said he did kill Maude Flanders (a character I never really liked), and Frank Grimes. If you think about it, Homer was always dumb, but in the earlier years, he was a lovable kind of dumb, now's he's just too stupid to like anymore. The producers (led by the evil Dana Gould) have really screwed up this show so bad, that it's just unwatchabble anymore!!! I just hope next year is it, and I mean IT because frankly I can't take it anymore (Fox has signed it for another season, and has an option for 2003-2004. Matt Groening doesn't have the power to choose when the show ends). This show has become a mere shell of its former self that it's not even funny. I'll be surprised if this show does see the year 2004. Please let 2002-2003 be the end already!!!!",NA,"27 May 2002"
"250","If you are like me you just had to enjoy ""The, Simpsons"" at one time or another. This cartoon of a raucous blue collar family mocked everything from society to other movies and TV-series. Homer, the dad, was lovable and very funny you just loved the way he took charge of the Simpson family. The females in the family were great to you had the two most intelligent the wife and organizer Marge and the daughter Lisa the bright but unnoticed second grader, then the last female was baby Maggie. However it was the obnoxious ten year-old Bart who entertained and destroyed the local neighborhood. Bart sure did capture the attention of the America public he simply had that ability, back in 1989 these sayings from Bart were said all across America and appeared on T-shirts (""Don't have a cow, man!,"" ""Smooth move, man!,"" ""Eat my shorts!""). You all know that Bart Simpson left an impact on all of us Americans. Right Dude!",NA,"7 May 2001"
"251","I have been watching the Simpson's since I was about seven years old, I am now 16 and have grown up on the fantastic voices, characters and humour of arguably the greatest TV show EVER!!. I thought it was a mistake when i turned over to the Simpson's for the first time, but it has simply become my favourite show. i could not resist the temptation of watching such quality entertainment as this, and admiring Matt Groening and his team for creating such an iconic masterpiece.it suits all ages as it is a cartoon with clever uses of adult humour and satire, with the added swearing from time to time. I must have seen each episode there has ever been several times. yes, i am that sad, but i can relate to it because i have been watching it for over half my life. The episodes recently have gone downhill to the more humorous and memorable middling episodes but is still the longest running show of all time. and it must be good if it can churn out jokes and each episode is a landmark towards 400. I highly recommend this show SO much! I could write for ever on my favourite character, homer and his funny, foolish ways. but i wont, I will let this amazing cartoon entice you into a show years ahead of its time. Not even shows like family guy can make you laugh the same way in which the Simpson's does, or even compare in the same way for animation. I do admire family guy, especially the third series, but it wont be able to stay so fresh, so witty and for so long and for this, the simpsons is not just the greatest cartoon of all time, but simply the best EVER! I just cant understand anyone who doesn't appreciate all of the hard work put into the show, WATCH IT NOW!","10","27 January 2007"

As good as Family Guy is, it well never mean 1/10th as much as the Simpsons because the Simpsons have been going on for 18 years and it means something because all the celebrities and Its a the most amazing animation and family-comedy out their and will continue to be for along time.

"253","When `The Simpsons' started out as a full-length TV show back in December 1989, it was very uncertain of itself. There were too roads it could take. It could be a children's lightweight entertainment series with morals and little or no humour. Or it could take the world by storm and become THE funniest show on television. After a while, it thankfully chose the latter. But between '89 and early '92 it remained as childrens fodder, (Homer's Oddesy, Moaning Lisa etc.) but it was finding its voice. Then for a few years it became an absolute laugh riot. Laughs just kept on coming and the familiar matters were consistently entertaining. It knew its limits and appealed to children and adults alike. Episodes like `Last Exit to Springfield' and `Marge in Chains' are good examples of this. Between '96 and '98 the show was still enjoyable, but hadn't quite rematched it's former peak of excellence. But the episodes were still moderately entertaining. But now, the show has reached rock bottom and it's still digging. Of course, there are one or two exceptions to the rule, (Trilogy of Error, etc.) The episodes are getting worse every single week with their ludicrous plots and sometimes-tasteless jokes. I think they fired all the good scriptwriters. Nowadays, they just resort to increasingly adulty sexual references and making fun of countries, races and ethics. Every week, they seem to have yet another celebrity voice. They are also making fun of actors, singers and other celebrities. In order to like these jokes you have to be familiar with the material, which most people are not.
The characters are losing their appeal aswell. Bart is now a spoilt brat. Homer is an annoying jackass. Lisa whines and complains a lot and Marge is <U+0085> Marge. The plot concepts are getting more and more far out as the weeks go by. Indeed, `The Simpsons' should have ended year's back, before it entered this downward spiral. It was once brilliant, but now it's just plain rubbish.",NA,"14 February 2003"

"255","This is perfection my friends 18 years later and i'm still in love with the first king of animated comedy. Even if you are one of the five people who don't like The Simpsons you must respect it for it's originality, success, and the pure iconic way it has cemented itself into life.I believe this is the perfect mix of comedy it's wacky, over the top, character humour, that often has a dosage of random, political, and satirical humour it has something for everyone. The only thing i can complain about is that it is too obviously republican in it's messages and it picks sides instead of giving a middle alternative opinion. This show however has created a memorable family and over 500 memorable supporting characters everybody knows and loves. I hope in the future they do more episodes centering around supporting characters as they've been doing in later season with Willy, Principal Skinner, Moe Sizlak, Apu, etc. The Simpsons can always hold your attention with a hilarious plot but what makes them so great and so consistently funny is the fact that they have created some of the best, lovable, and most iconic, characters in television history. I personally love their Halloween specials entitled Treehouse Of Horror which is The Simpson's free pass to spoof three horror movies or stories and give hilarious spins on popular stories. In a certain few later seasons they seemed to go downhill i think because they were trying too hard to compete with Family Guy which i consider equal ground to The Simpsons. The one thing The Simpsons has over Family Guy is when they spoof something by making say Dracula Mr.Burns the character has relevance and originality while Family Guy just reenacts a scene and replaces the person with a Family Guy character.I think now that it's nearing it's nineteenth season it's soon time to end television greatest animated achievement and FOX's #1 show for years. I think given the movies success they have another few years to entertain us before going out on top. Matt Groening is a genius as is every writer and voice actor that brings these original, innovative, and lovable characters to life. The Simpsons will forever be a part of me and a part of TV milestones and achievements.","10","25 July 2007"
"256","I really don't need to explain myself or the background of this show to state how epic it was and still is today. In it's early beginnings on the Tracy Ullman Show, no one ever knew that it would shape up to be one of the biggest television successes the medium has ever seen. Because of this, I wouldn't be surprised if fans still praise the Simpsons fifty years from now, since it made so many headlines. Furthermore, the show may be used to study how we entertained ourselves in the near future. Since everyone here has already contributed to what has made the Simpsons such an epic show, I will skip the details and backgrounds to get right to the point. At it's very best, the Simpsons was something that EVERY American HAD to watch. Everyone loved seeing their favorite dysfunctional family on-screen. Homer Simpson, the dimwitted but lovable father, is hilarious in his blunders (D'oh!). Marge is the voice of passion, and puts her family as top priority above everything else. Lisa is the smart and intellectual younger sibling, who often gets frustrated with her older brother. Bart is the infamous school hating prankster who devises a scheme or two to enrage Homer. The Simpsons, along with everything else in Springfield, has something that almost any television viewer can relate to. To summarize this up, it had witty, clever, sophisticated humor that made Matt Groening a multi-millionaire, pushing the Simpsons to the top of the list. Since it's debut, it has remained one of the most popular television families in America.The Simpsons however, isn't without it's flaws. I consider Season's two to eight to be masterpieces, and arguably the ""Golden Age"" of the Simpsons. Unfortunately, the writing has declined a bit thru the years, which made our beloved Simpsons not as well as they could be. The antics became more unrealistic to the point of being unfunny, and many famous guest stars would simply just pop in without any explanation or purpose. Furthermore the cast just didn't seem to care as much anymore. But as with everyone else, what comes up must come down. And the Simpsons is no exception, which is why I rated this a nine instead of a perfect score. That being said, it's still better than most modern television sitcoms. I just happen to be a Simpsons fan who has seen it evolve into the phenomenon it is today.So there you have it. Twenty years later and the Simpsons is STILL going strong. It may not be as culturally powerful as it was in it's heyday, but it's pretty obvious at this point that we will continue to discuss this show for generations to come. It has been awarded more times than ANY other show out there, and the Simpsons is simply a master of it's craft. Even if you aren't a fan of situational comedies or animation works of art, I highly recommend you watch this series at least ONCE. You can learn a lot from this show, even as it continues to laugh at politics, popular culture and even itself.Whether your a fan who is leaning towards the older seasons of the Simpsons or if your seeing it for the first time, the cultural awareness and fan-base surrounding this show proves that it won't be leaving our television sets anytime soon. If you can't notice the details, you aren't a television buff. Nine out of Ten.","9","19 February 2009"

"258","What can I say? The Simpsons has to be my favorite show of all time. There is never an episode That fails to crack me up. One of my favorite things about the show is that it is original, but unfortunately it spawned numerous ripoffs, Family Guy, King of the hill, American dad, etc. Without this show, these ripoffs would not exist. Another great thing about this show is the sense of humor. Like I said, It cracks me up every time. And best of all, There's tons of episodes, so I don'have to keep watching reruns. So altogether The Simpsons has got to be the best comedy I have ever seen. I'm not surprised this show has managed to survive since 1989.",NA,"3 October 2006"
"259","Best television cartoon in television animation history. It's just like what South Park said, The Simpsons already did it. The Simpsons basically already did everything there is to do in animation and they always inventing new ideas. Their episodes are clever, their jokes are clever, Homer is just the spice of this show.What everyone expects when they watch The Simpsons is Homer and Bart Simpson. But my favorite character is Homer Simpson. His catchphrase is ""Doh."" I don't think there is anyone who has never heard of that, even if they don't watch the Simpsons. Homer is dumb, stupid, repulsive, and that is what makes him funny.The Simpsons make a bad example of the American family, but that doesn't stop me watching because I don't know anyone who would think that an American family would act so dysfunctional. Although, I only know two people in the United Kingdom, one in Australia, and two in Canada.I recommend this show ages 13 and up. Although there is some younger people who watch it because they are mature enough to understand the jokes and not do everything Bart Simpson does.","10","21 July 2007"

I hate every episode that involves Lisa as the main star in the episode, only episodes I didn't hate about Lisa is when she goes to military school, she meets those bad girls in the ladies room and there may be 1 or 2 more.

"264","""'The Simpsons' is rich in satire. Without question it is one of the most intelligent and literate comedies on television today. (We know that's not saying much but still...) It may seem incongruous to those who have dismissed it as a mere cartoon about an oaf and his family (and we've seen plenty of those) to say that the show is intelligent and literate, but attentive viewing reveals levels of comedy far beyond farce. We see layer upon layer of satire, double meanings, allusions to high as well as popular culture, sight gags, parody, and self-referential humor.""From the opening introduction of ""The Simpsons and Philosophy,"" edited by William Irwin, Mart T. Conard, and Aeon J. Skoble.That says a lot of what can be said about ""The Simpsons."" Matt Groening, the creator, had struck gold when he decided to introduce the world of Springfield, USA, and its most prominent citizens. (No, not C. Montgomery Burns; I'm talking about the Simpson family.) Duh. This is one of the richest, funniest, and damn entertaining cartoons on television right now. (I've heard it's on its way to Guiness and if it's already there, more power to Groening and his team of writers and animators.)Yes, we all know who they are by heart. There's Homer Simpson, the father and lackadaisical head of the family. Then there's Marge Simpson, the loving and supportive wife. Bart, the underachieving son (and proud of it, no less) who is also the town's little hell-raiser. Then there's Lisa, the brilliant, righteous daughter - the one who's not messing up her life. And lastly, there's little Maggie; silence is golden, isn't it? (""The Simpsons and Philosophy"" contains a rather interesting essay about Maggie and why she matters.)I completed reading ""The Simpsons and Philosophy"" a couple of weeks ago and it contained a number of insightful essays on the underlying philosophical elements and satire running in the cartoon's undercurrent. It's impossible to watch ""The Simpsons"" and not get swept up in the numerous gags and references to popular culture.Everything gets parodied in some fashion, from ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""North By Northwest"" (1959), ""The Matrix,"" (1999), FOX's own ""King of the Hill,"" ""The Critic,"" ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968), ""Godzilla"" (1954), and numerous others. It doesn't seem like anything is safe from Groening and his team of creators.I've seen them all, and it's easy to pick out favorites. Who can forget the oh-so-romantic story of how Homer and Marge first met, how Marge went to prom with (future) egomaniac Arty Ziff, and then drives along the highway to find Homer walking in the mud. Pure romantic. And also, who can forget that episode where Bart cuts the head off the statue of Springfield's founder, Jebediah Springfield? Or when Lisa gets a pony, forcing Homer to work two jobs? Or when sweet little Maggie is welcomed into the world? And last, who shot Mr. Burns?Each episode is colorful, taking to task a number of issues from gay marriage, to the NRA, to religion, to immigration, to the legalization of marijuana; it doesn't stop anywhere for anyone, and I anticipate ""The Simpsons"" on going a lot further than anyone could have ever imagined. It all comes together in a take-no-prisoners fashion that leaves you to question what's really going on inside Groening's head.And there's plenty of supporting characters to choose from: Smithers, Abraham Simpson, Patty and Selma Bouvier, Apu the Quik-E-Mart shopkeep, Moe, Dr. Hibbert, Chief Wiggum, the Flanders family, Principal Skinner, Carl, Lenny and countless others. Let's not forget the frequent guests, who have included The Clash or Jon Lovitz (as ""Simpson""-produced acolyte Jay Sherman, ""The Critic""), or the late Robert Stack, who reverted back to his ""Untouchables"" days and once voiced Eliot Ness-inspired prohibition officer Rex Banner.""The Simpsons"" is, hands down, my favorite, current-running animated program. In 50 years or so, it'll probably still be going and remain just as fresh as it was back in 1987 when it first appeared. Matt Groening, you are genius.",NA,"6 August 2005"
"265","And mostly all has been said about the simpsons. Some people are saying that Simpsons have changed with time and they certainly have, but after 20 years they are still so damn good that you just can't miss an episode.Throughout the years I think there's been just one point where the simpsons weren't as good as usual. And that place was for me season 10 and few after that. Story lines got a bit weird around then, for example navy episode where Milhouse, Bart, Nelson and Ralph ( If I can remember right ) started a band.But soon this period was over and the newest seasons are great to watch. In season 20 we can see springfield people using mobile phones and iPods, the stuff which humankind could barely dream about in 1989 when The simpsons started. Same is with U.S. presidents. We have seen B. Clinton in the simpsons, but in season 20 Homer votes for Obama. And that's cool but same time a bit weird in the simpsons. Lisa is still 8 years old, Bart 10, Maggie is still a baby and can't talk and so on. And I really like that. Sometimes it's just fun to think about that and that makes The Simpsons really cool.In spite of all that writers have changed a lot during the years. Maude died, Apu got married and have 8 kids now, Krusty who was loved by children in earlier seasons but now he can't make any fun jokes and has some problems with alcohol etc.Also what makes The Simpsons special are episodes where all background stories are shown. For example how Marge and Homer met, why is Flanders such a calm and caring person and how did Smithers become Mr. Burns loyal servant.Actually I can't say anything bad about any episode from season 3 when writers got The Simpsons really started and I think that's a great achievement. Even tho all story lines haven't always been too good, all the jokes and characters are just so well-made that you have to watch it. All characters are so different and same time funny. Think about Flanders, Otto, Skinner, Moe, Patty and Selma and grandpa. Nothing similar about them yet they're all differently funny.Some of my favourite episodes are the ones where Lisa's, Bart's and Homer's day are shown, episode where Homer becomes and Ice-cream man, episode where Homer eats Japanese poisoned fish and is about to die, episode where Marge becomes a carpenter and also the very first episode of The Simpsons from where it all got started and I hope is still having a long future!","10","14 February 2009"
"266","THE SIMPSONS are & 4ever will b the best show ever to grace tv. There will NEVER be anything quite like it ever again. I just hope THE SIMPSONS keep going on & on. So what, if they have reached their 12th season, I love the show!! Rock on Simpsons!!",NA,"7 November 2000"
"267","Just kidding :)If you ever find yourself stuck for half an hour, with nothing to do, watch a Simpsons episode, and you'll find yourself wondering where the time went, and in a much better mood.After each episode (most) I find myself with a smile on my face long after the lady in the ""Gracie Films"" thing has shushed and 20th Century Fox has deafened me with their infernal logo of death.No series has ever impacted TV and society like the Simpsons, it is cutting edge television, it rivals Seinfeld as the most commonly quoted show. ""D'oh"" is used so commonly in society, it should be put into the dictionary. Yes, the Simpsons has left a mark on us all.I seriously hope this show never ends, it would leave a bigger hole in our hearts, greater than the sadness of ""Cheers"" and ""Seinfelds"" endings combined.",NA,"9 January 1999"
"268","The Simpsons is a tv show that has aged horribly. It started of absolutely incredible but after about season 9 you could see the slow painful decline. But how did it get so bad? Well most writers started walking away from the show and even the creator of the show Matt Groening moved away and started working on Futurama. There are a few hidden gems in the newer seasons,most future episodes and Ned and Homer becoming spies. But I'll give credit were credit is due from season 1-9 The Simpsons was the best thing on television counties classic episodes like Marge vs the monorail or Lisa goes Washington or in my personal opinion the very underrated Bart gets an elephant of course there are other classics that I haven't mentioned because there's so many I'm glad there finally ending this shoe after 30 long seasons. My dream would be for all the old writers to do the final episode together.","9","29 October 2018"
"269","What can be said about this wonderful and impactful series. One of the longest-running and most important series on television, there isn't much more to add.","10","27 November 2021"
"270","What stemmed from a series of primitive animated shorts featured on the Tracey Ullman Show has evolved into what is considered by many to be the funniest TV program in syndication. THE SIMPSONS' success was phenomenal during its first year, and has been TV's highest rated cartoon show ever since. Right from the get-go it formed a gigantic cult following, making Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie worldwide household names. And as anybody who watches the show will tell you: it's not hard to see why.THE SIMPSONS was truly ahead of its time. The surreal situations presented within are often driven by cleverly disguised scrutiny on both morality and the absurd, often hypocritical nature of the American people, but they all seem make sense in their own weird, Springfieldian way. However, aside from the biting satire and social commentary tucked away in every episode, the show boasts a brilliant sense of humor that has so far been unmatched by any other series. Each episode is crammed with so much hilarity that multiple viewings will always yield something new. But for those who aren't fond of watching reruns, have no fear! Since the jokes work so well on so many different levels, repeat viewings aren't at all boring.The town of Springfield, where THE SIMPSONS is set, is alone enough to capture one's interest. Springfield is a world all its own. It has every possible landform and climate in the books, and is home to a nuclear power plant, a television station, and a maximum security prison, yet it somehow effectively maintains that small-town atmosphere. The hundreds of residents within are as dynamic and lovable as they are hilarious and eccentric, and they are each given unique personalities, voices, and backgrounds. And with each passing episode, these characters continue to develop.It's great to see that after 13 years, Matt Groening's amazing cartoon is still going strong. In fact, it has actually improved with time and continues to get funnier and funnier with each passing season. I can honestly say that I hope this show goes on forever, and I know that I am not alone when I say that.","10","28 November 2002"
"271","When this show debuted as a sketch on the Tracy Ullman show on the fledgling Fox network in 1987, it became so popular that Matt Groening was forced to create a tv show that became the longest running TV show ever, and the stuff of legend. D'oh!!!","10","30 April 2018"
"272","Wonderful drama with great acting and excellent storylines.","10","24 April 2021"
"273","THE SIMPSONS is a really cool television show and I'm going to explain this into 10 facts, instead of just an in-depth review: 1. The characters are just memorable and the voice actors plays them very well.2. The show spawned into a mega franchise, including a movie, which came out in 2007 and I reviewed it on IMDb.3. My favorite characters on the show are Maggie Simpson and Bart Simpson and I love the way they are created.4. The theme is composed by Danny Elfman and is one of his most memorable themes, that has ever done for a movie or TV show.5. The animation is still great today, as it was in 1989, when the series first premiered on Fox.6. The title sequence at the beginning of the film and it was really amazing and just spectacular as now as it was back then.7. My favorite episodes, I just can't describe them, but I like all of the episodes in each season.8. The ""Treehouse of Horror"" episodes are not really all that scary and is just simply cool and amazing as hell.9. The character designs are just amazing and I give credit to the creators including Matt Groening and James L. Brooks 10. The couch gags on every episode of the TV show is just amazing and really well thought out and very amazing. My favorite ones are the Etch-A-Sketch gag, the 500 episodes gag, the ""Treehouse of Horror"" episodes couch gags and of course, the dancing couch gag with the elephants and the Egyptian dancing in the second episode of the second season.Overall, these are the reasons why I watch THE SIMPSONS.","10","22 September 2015"
"274","The simpsons tv show is super good later seasons kinda sucked but the first few wow it was great I loved it all unfortunately the treehouse of horror episodes getting kinda lame because it's not scary anymore that was a disappointment for me but wow overall simpsons is great.","9","3 August 2021"
"275","I think this is the best motion picture, television show and animation ever. The freshness of the plot has remained consistent, the neverending gags never wear, and one could entertain himself for millenia watching repeats. For those few grains of the solar system of rice who haven't seen it, it features the lives and connected activities of the Simpson Family, and of the citizens of their town, Springfield. Springfield, an anytown U.S.A filled with stereotypes, satires and hilarious parodies of American characters, has a constant supply of adventure, comedy and all round glorious fun. The best thing about this series is it's failure to tire. Every new season brings with it a multitude of new fodder for fans and casual watchers alike, and who could miss such a modern day classic? The main characters, Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie, the human members of the family, each have their own deep personality, gained from exerience within and without the show, much of it within. As we watch from the first shorts to the latest episodes and the movie, we see a progression in character unlike any other show. Not only is the irony of this progression next to the stillness of image (Maggie is still a baby after twenty years) magnificent, but characters develop phases, reflecting culture and views of the years they inhabit. In recent years mobiles and laptops have become more frequent, yet still the family cars remain the same 80s models they used to drive. The classic opening credits will never be forgotten. All in all, 10/10 easily.","10","21 January 2005"
"276","You heard the title right. Those Simpsons may have predicted the future many times and got it right but there's one thing they lied about for 30 years, they're the longest running cartoon in the world. Now The Simpsons were on air for 30 years, much longer than cartoons now. But after some web surfing I found out that the original Looney Tunes shorts aired from 1930 to 1969, a total of 39 years(39 FRICKEN YEARS) that's 9 years more than the the Simpsons. And they're not even the second longest running cartoon. Scooby-Doo is 50 years old, Tom and Jerry are 79, and Mickey Mouse just celebrated his 91st birthday and the Simpsons are only 30. So they are 5th longest running cartoon. And to make matters worse everybody thinks they are instantly the best cartoon when they're not even close to being the best. Now cartoons like the Looney Tunes, Scooby-Doo, Tom & Jerry, Ren & Stimpy, even Spongebob can be qualified as the best but not the Simpsons. And to make matters even worse they are now inescapable. Everywhere I go there they are. Anything cartoon related in the Guinness Book of World Records deals with the Simpsons, when I look up longest running educational tv show on Google Images I see a picture of the Simpsons alongside Sesame Street( which is 100 times better), and when I look up best cartoon characters/ series, guess who's number one? That's right, Mr. Big Yellow Stupid head and his family. Now I will be fair on the first few seasons because without those we wouldn't have the Shinning or the glorious Steamed Hams. But after that it took a turn for the worse. Everything got bad, Bart forgot how sincere and kind he was and turned into an all out jerk, Marge and Lisa( who I actually like) were voted the worst Simpsons characters, Homer doesn't give a dang about his life and is as dumb as a doorknob, the violence level boosted by a lot, and they are just not funny anymore. If you agree with me then don't stay silent, let your voice be heard. Spread the truth. Start a riot, invade Fox studios, and end this abomination before they go on forever. Hurry before it's too late.","4","14 May 2019"
"277","Are the later episodes of ""The Simpsons"" a notch below earlier ones? Yes, but even lesser episodes improve on repeat viewings (and between Sky One's current screening of 19 episodes a week (you heard me, NINETEEN) and BBC2's further weekday airings, you have plenty of chances to view them again).Do the characters go a bit too far sometimes? Yes, but with Al Jean taking over from Mike Scully the signs for the new season are good (and in fairness to Scully, he did introduce some more continuity - just as Lisa's vegetarianism is an ongoing thing, so is Apu's love life and Barney's staying on the wagon... I'm glad they realise alcoholism isn't funny).Do guest stars ruin the episodes they're on? With the exception of Mel Gibson, no (I even liked the one with 'Nsync).Has ""The Simpsons"" degenerated as much by its thirteenth season as ""The Flintstones"" had by its sixth and final season? Let me put it this way - have any aliens become regular cast members (and no, Kang and Kodos don't count)?When it ends, it'll have its share of weak episodes, but all long-running shows do, and no one will remember anything but the long-raning success it was/is. Ultimately stories like ""Insane Clown Poppy"" and ""Beyond Blunderdome"" are the equivalent of a few rotting apples in the barrel; I haven't mourned ""Seinfeld,"" but I'll mourn this.",NA,"9 March 2002"
"278","The Simpsons is possibly and probably the biggest show on Television, and has been for the past 14 - 15 years or however long it's been running. Sure, there's all that stuff about Reality Shows but The Simpsons is still talked about a sure lot. Earlier seasons have shows re- run on UPN channel, while new ones play on Fox about every Sunday night. The older ones are classic. Everyone in the cast is excellently scripted, with such an amazing flow of humor and such a way of making you laugh very hard. Unfortunately, the new season(s) seem to be falling short, and are just relying on old, dying humor. The voice- acting all around is amazing, with very big attention to details (little grunts, etc.). As I mentioned before, the script is excellent, really packing a punch in each episode. Sure the new ones aren't doing quite so well as the old ones, but the script is still solid. The Simpsons is probably one of Television's biggest shows in History, and in a sense it rightfully deserves to be. However, it's getting old and should be cancelled soon, but the older ones are great to just sit back, leave your brain at the door and enjoy. 9/10",NA,"11 May 2003"
"279","This show is incredibly hilarious! It is a cult classic that rates next to Monty Python's Flying Circus and Mr. Bean. Finally America has a great cult show (Star Trek is a cult show but it's not good, and Futurama just doesn't equal the Simpsons). My favorite episode is Rosebud (the one where Mr. Burns loses his Teddy Bear and then Maggie finds it). My favorite line from the show is from the Sea Captian. ""I'm the sailing instructARRG, and on movie night I run the projectARRG. Only PG, nothing ARRG."" That line is just so corny it's funny! However I fear the show has finally jumped the shark. But still it was a great 19 years. I hope the show lives forever... figuratively at least.",NA,"6 September 2009"

"282","Let's be honest. The Simpsons jumped the shark about 3 years ago. In fact, I can point out the exact episode that killed it: BABF09, ""Saddlesore Galactica"". They actually tried to make it as bad as they possibly could. Seriously. I have no idea why. Since then, it has not gone off the air as it should have at the end of season 11. IT continued, and produced such crap as the N'sync episode and the one with the singing hobo. Some better episodes have sporadically arisen, such as the ""trilogy of error"" episode and the one where Homer can't stop screaming (lmfao). But for the most part, Simpsons has been crap since season 12. I actually haven't seen any of the new episodes because i was so put off by the 300th. I absolutely hated it.Not only does the simpsons suck now, it is forcing Fox to kill a multitude of great shows like Greg the Bunny and Futurama, that may have survived had it not been for the Simpsons ratings monopoly. Kill the simpsons now before we lose any more great shows like Andy Richter.",NA,"6 June 2003"
"283","The Simpsons is an exceptional animated TV sitcom, still going strong and making TV history after a good 17 years (and still guaranteed to be on the air for a few more years), with an animated feature film also to look forward to in 2007. This show stars Homer Simpson (voiced by the great Dan Castellaneta) and his family Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie and their life in the town of Springfield (it's a running joke that we don't know where in the US they are located). While the show began very seriously, after a few seasons, it started to become a running gag, relying more on guest stars such as N'Sync and movie actors to keep the show fresh. Both the serious earlier seasons and the slapstick later seasons are fresh and hilarious, though in their different ways. Other supporting characters include Grampa, Krusty the Klown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Patty & Selma Bouvier, Nelson Muntz, The Flanders, Ralph Wiggum, Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum, Apu, Comic Book Guy, Montgomery Burns, Waylon Smithers, Ned Flanders, Kent Brockman, Rev. Lovejoy, Principal Skinner, Edna Krabappel, Milhouse Van Houten, among MANY MANY others. I look forward to this show staying on for many more years.","10","9 April 2006"
"284","The 90's. the simpsons were a college rock n' roll American laugh fest. The jokes were witty, they possess their unique style. truly it was understandable why it spawned so many seasons. The best were Seasons 2,3 and especially 5. There was so much memorable classic humor. Like on season 4 with Homer's hilarious day off church in Homer the heretic, Season 5's Boy Scoutz in da hood & And Homer rising to a god on Season 6 ""Homer the great"". But now it has all changed. Season 12 was The family's final moments And as the unlucky ""season 13"" Is let out, Me and my family have all been noticing a depressing change in the Quality of Humor used. It is, in fact depressing to watch the new episodes. When i hear another ""Lame"" joke. if My friends and family hear someone say a lame joke, We say that ""Is a new simpson joke"" because that is the New nature of the 13+ season simpsons. "" gay this, gay that, Finish it! What are you a lesbian? "" That's the only sort of things i here when i turn on the TV at 7:00 to everyones favourite cartoon family. Right now they are playing all the new episodes here. The simpsons have also lost their old standards. It's a lot more dirty now. i'll state the following things wrong with the new episodes: Characters use to much expression in their voice, Homer and bart are too outgoing, There is a lot more comical behaviour, Homer's shaking fist gimmick is lame, Marge talks a lot more and tries to be funny, everybody acts a lot smarter, Jokes from old episodes have been used again, Too much singing, too much crying, They're ALWAYS trying to be funny, The episode endings are real cheap and The situations they face are out of the original, im not done. The picture is too clear and perfect. Homer tries to live up to his stereotype and the facial expression aren't wacky enough. (If you want to see my idea of a funny facial expression, on season 5 ""homer goes too college"", look at Homer when he's holding the Toast.) People are just watching new episodes and not noting that they aren't funny because 12 funny seasons have made it second nature to believe Simpsons are funny. Soon they will realize it is now lame. Either rehire the old writers and artist, Use the ideas from Simpsons comics or just stop making them. It's now officially dead. It just will take a while too realize it. I loved the old seasons. too bad i'll never be seeing another funny episode of The Simpsons again.","10","22 January 2007"
"285","I still can't believe this show is still going on. I heard rumours it could possibly end one-day, but that has yet to happen. It really should because the show today does not feel like the show we all enjoyed back in the beginning. The first several seasons of The Simpsons were the best. Many of the episodes were such classics!!! you could watch it more than a dozen times, yet still not get bored. That's how awesome the show actually was. What made this show strikeout were its characters - there were several of them. Each had a purpose, and we all had a favourite. Many of the favourite ones are Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge, Maggie, Mr Burns, Ned, Apu, Skinner, Ralph etc. But I'm sure the most favourite ones among the fans were either Homer or Bart. This is a show where the entire family can sit down and watch. It's also a show which many kids seem to enjoy despite some of the many things within The Simpsons deeming unsuitable: that's one of the main reasons why this show was remarkable in the first place. I remember coming back home from school, and the first thing I would see on television is The Simpsons. I live in the United Kingdom, and as a child I would see The Simpsons on BBC. I didn't have Sky back then, but as soon as I did, one of the first things I did after coming back home from school was to watch The Simpsons on Sky One. There were several episodes on there simultaneously: it was like a dream come true. I enjoyed several of these episodes so much that I would eventually record them on my Sky player, so I could watch them. However, the same can't be said once the years rolled by. Since the start of the 21st century, the show started to go downhill, and the episodes started to get not just boring but very boring. You can tell, intuitively, just how poor a lot of the episodes from the later seasons had started to become. They were just nowhere near as good as those from the earlier seasons. I know there will be a difference in opinion, but I'm sure most will agree. Some of the episodes from the later seasons were fine, but not the majority of them for sure. The perfect time to have ended this show was right after The Simpsons Movie was released, which was a success. But I knew that wasn't going to happen considering how popular the show still was; how much a success the movie was; and how much money it was still making. You can't blame the producers really. I heard rumours that it will likely end after the 30th season, and I hope it's true because it has gone on for far too long. Also, I'm amazed the characters in Simpsons never seem to grow-up: that's what I truly find remarkable about this show.",NA,"28 April 2018"
"286","It is well known that The Simpsons is the greatest animated show ever to be broadcast on television, and in writing a review of it I understand that I run the risk of only boringly reiterating what everyone already knows. There have never been any television shows that have approached the sheer brilliance of a show like The Simpsons, although I will admit that one show, Family Guy, possesses a level of utter hilarity and quality that it is more than able to hold its own against The Simpsons, although even that excellent show is able to surpass the great Simpson family.Homer Simpson is arguably one of the most entertaining and original characters ever broadcast on television, and is without a doubt the heart of the show, with Bart coming in a VERY close second and Marge, Lisa, and Maggie, as well as the mind bogglingly extensive list of side characters, are there to balance it out. There is a huge hierarchy of characters that are involved in show after show of brilliant comedy and entertainment. As they said in a song in a recent show, `Have no fear, we've got stories for years.' From the way that they've been going for more than a decade and continue to provide tremendously superior entertainment compared to all of the slop that pollutes the television airwaves these days (Survivor, The Weakest Link, Temptation freaking Island (by FAR one of the stupidest things I have ever imagined being aired on mainstream television), The Real World, Sorority Life (yes, I know it hasn't aired yet, but it was filmed about two blocks from where I'm sitting right now, and I have no doubt in the world that it is going to be a ridiculous mess), and basically everything else on MTV that's not The Osbournes).I could on for hours about the disturbingly lengthy list of complete trash that is regularly broadcast on mainstream television these days, and it will clearly a sign of human kind's descent into barbarism if we ever witness the cancellation of The Simpsons in the midst of all of this crap. We can only hope, then, for the sake of humanity, that the show will be aired indefinitely.",NA,"6 August 2002"
"287","We all seem to know America's favorite family. A family that has influenced so much of pop culture. We've all been familiar with The Simpsons and their voices, along with the fictional town of Springfield. It will be Halloween next month, and it would still be really cool to dress up as a Simpsons character. However, one thing I've been hearing about on the internet and through a lot of your comments is the show isn't as good as it used to be, that a lot of us prefer the older episodes. I've been hearing it for many years as most of us seem to prefer the episodes before 2000, there have been a few good episodes since then, and even a lot of the newer episodes aren't bad, just not as good, memorable, or funny. About all this, I once saw a quick YouTube clip with Justin Bieber in it as he was in an episode and the top comment said, ""R.I.P. The Simpsons 1989-1998."" The show was at it's best during that time and it seems like it was at it's peak during the mid '90s like when they showed the ""Who Shot Mr. Burns Episodes."" I even bought a DVD at the Super Market a year ago which shows the Treehouse of Horror episodes from Seasons 5, 6, 7, and 12. While Treehouse of Horror for Season 12 isn't bad, it's not as good as those other ones where they show things like Homer Simpson going into 3D World and show things like Groundskeeper Willie being in all the kids nightmares. I have to tell you, those episodes don't get old. It is still nice to watch them years later. I remember like 15 years ago when the show was on 3 times a day. There used to be what they called double d'ohs of laughing I think at like 6:30 and 7:00 on Fox. They'd also show an episode at 11:00 PM on Fox. My oldest sister even liked a couple of guys that were obsessed with The Simpsons. However, this show lost its appeal and most of us probably don't care to see a lot of the newer episodes. I think Fox should start showing more of the reruns from when this show was popular. The episodes we're more familiar with as you can Google search an episode and be able to read all about it on Wikipedia. Most of the time when you look ahead on Tivo of the episodes that will be airing, most of them are the newer episodes. I think Fox would get more viewers if they started to show the old episodes. What makes this show good, we got to know basically all the characters in Springfield. The episode had interesting plots and the beginning of a lot of episodes often times started out with a different plot making the main plot of the episode unpredictable from the beginning. It was also a really funny show. Now, it seems like the show is trying to be funny but they're running out of ideas and humor. Overall, I'd give this show a 9/10 as it used to be really good and will forever remain a classic.","9","22 September 2014"
"288","....or pitifully out of touch political pandering. One of the two. Not funny either way. Honestly it's just a series of tropes and cliches. I would strongly recommend people never watch this show.","3","15 March 2022"
"289","I rate The Simpsons a 6/10, why? It is because from Seasons 1-10, they were classic, however, in more recent years most episodes were in one way or another a partial repeat of earlier ones, or just plain bad ideas.My belief is that everything had been done by The Simpsons, or everything that can come to mind for a show for audiences 14 or older.Repeatetive lines and events make the once great animated comedy a bore.Things such as Lisa's birthday, which she has had 3, and The Simpsons going to another continent, South America, Africa, Asia twice, Europe several times.The now annoying personality of characters such as Marge and Lisa and the seemingly Bart and Homer based new episodes have created a Simpsons for a new generation, children who didn't grow up in the 90s can enjoy Simpsons on the same level as those who did. However, as a complete overlook, in overall standard, the old and new episodes judged as one, I can safely say it's a modest 6.","7","1 September 2006"
"290","Frankly, I agree with all the more negative reviews of this show. Yeah, there was a time when The Simpsons was the funniest show around, but let's be honest. When's the last time anyone watched The Simpsons and laughed WITH it?Personally, I stopped watching it after they killed Maude Flanders off the show. I know it's just a cartoon, but that was still a terrible way to do it. In fact, The Simpsons' ratings seriously dropped after that episode. And I've noticed that now the more celebrities there are, the wacker the episode is. (That episode with *NSYNC reminded me why I stopped watching it in the first place.)The chalkboard gags aren't even creative any more, the episodes feel like someone wrote them in about two minutes, and...you know, there should be a rule that Dan Castellaneta should never be allowed to write an episode again. There was one episode he wrote with his wife (from Season 11 or 12) called ""Days Of Wine And D'ohses"", and if it were up to me, I would have fired him for that if he didn't do so many voices.So in the end, The Simpsons WAS one of the best shows around, but it sure isn't now. If you think it is, quit living in the past.",NA,"15 November 2002"
"291","The Simpsons is one of those rather rare TV shows that will appeal to every member of the family. It has jokes for both adults and children and generally there is a very good moral at the end of each story.First of all we have Homer. He is fat,lazy, and weak willed but beneath it all he is a good man whose heart is always in the right place. He loves Marge and the kids and despite being tempted more than once to stray he always stays faithful.Now Marge, she is the sensible calming influence, always ready to fear the worst and married to Homer that is usually the case. You often wonder why she married Homer but if she hadn't, Homer would have turned out like Barney.The kids are complete opposites, Bart is a very horrible little boy always getting into trouble as opposed to Lisa who is the straight A student. Maggie is only a baby.As with all great comedy shows the Simpsons benefit from a first rate cast of secondary characters. The religious Flanders, the washed up clown Krusty and my favourite Chief Wiggum. (In the UK the police are sometimes unkindly referred to as the Pigs, has anyone else picked up on Wiggums nose ?) With actors, politicians and sportsman lining up to appear on the show I am sure this will continue for another 20 years.Favourite episode - Santas little Helper, when Homer walked through the door on Xmas eve, broke because he hadn't got his bonus, with an abandoned greyhound he was in tears. Then Lisa said what a wonderful Xmas present the dog was for all the family .... I had a tear in my eye as well - that is the true meaning of Xmas.",NA,"10 January 2006"
"292","I am mainly reviewing this up to the 7th year(and I own the sets up to and including that one). I will admit that the very first of this wasn't all great... drawings were crude, it was ""messy"", and it leaned towards the sappy/hokey on occasion... but it did have moments. And right after, from the beginning of the second season, this was an amazing show. The animation got to be rather good just about immediately. The writing more often than not packed with social commentary, sometimes silly, though with little to no exceptions, funny. This is consistently well-done, almost entirely invariably. The references(to everything in and outside of showbiz, within the last several decades) are typically well-done, and this was self-aware and sophisticated. The characters are relate-able, flawed and credible. The comedy usually steered clear of toilet humor and material tends to go for the smart, satirical gag. The show maintained a high level until the eighth or so, when it started to go downhill. Since then it merely seems to grow worse with each successive effort. The jokes(which really aren't worth much to begin with, even the few of them that aren't solely based on public humiliation, other disgusting stuff and/or physical pain/abuse) have multiple punchlines, go against the canon for no good reason, and they practically spell out how sucky this has gotten. The DVDs hold special features such as animatics, alternate language reels, deleted scenes, a commentary track for every individual collection of 22 minutes of fun(with relevant people who worked on them, and, if not always, actors), and crew people either sharing inside information or introducing the extras/episodes, and they tend to be worth your time. I realize that my criticism of the recently aired of this might lead some to avoid this altogether, so I suggest anyone considering it to not do so(and heck, if you do like even the new, have at it), or you would give up many hours of hilarious, finger-on-the-pulse cleverness. And that would be downright nutty. I heartily recommend this to anyone who enjoys laughing and has enough of a base of knowledge of pop culture and American society from the 80's through the 90's. 8/10","8","14 September 2008"
"293","I was born the same year The Simpsons aired for the first time. Eight years later, I became acquainted with the show and since then I have been unable to stop watching it, even when I happen to see the same episode four or five times. Such is the charisma of what has to be the finest animated program to have ever come from America (or any other country, for that matter).In case someone wasn't familiar with the series (though it is unlikely), here goes: the show is set in an average US town, called Springfield. That's where the Simpsons live: Homer (Dan Castellaneta) is a lovable doofus who spends his days working at a nuclear power plant and drinking beer; his wife Marge (Julie Kavner), best known for her scary hairstyle, looks after their three children, quintessential TV brat Bart (Nancy Cartwright), saxophone-playing Lisa (Yeardley Smith) and the perpetually two-year old Maggie. Around them, dozens of other characters cross paths in often hilarious ways, exposing all things bad about being American.It is that satirical aspect, paired with endless pop-culture references, that have made The Simpsons a benchmark in intelligent entertainment (a paradox in several US sitcoms). Okay, so the quality of the gags has started to fade recently, but with the first 200 episodes or so being nearly flawless it is easy to forgive these shortcomings. The same goes for the characters: overblown caricatures they may be, but as long as the show exists the likes of Mr. Burns, Moe Szyslak, Seymour Skinner and Krusty the Clown will remain among the funniest creations of American television (although Homer and his immortal ""D'oh"" will never be surpassed). And while the satire is a little weaker nowadays, the stream of film references is as strong as ever: Pulp Fiction, The Godfather, Planet of the Apes, Citizen Kane, Raiders of the Lost Ark... There is plenty to be enjoyed by film buffs, who will also have fun recognizing the numerous celebrity voices that keep appearing in the series. Personally, my favorites are Mel Gibson as himself and Kelsey ""Frasier"" Grammar as the evil Sideshow Bob.And let's not forget the iconic opening sequence, which features Danny Elfman's most recognizable and instantly memorable piece of music.In short: no matter what weaknesses new episodes might have, The Simpsons remains essential viewing, as it usually packs more wit and brilliance in 22 minutes than most movies manage in two hours. 'Nuff said.","9","9 August 2005"

"295","""THE SIMPSONS,"" in my opinion, is an absolute FOX classic! I've seen every episode, and I really enjoy it. It's hard to say which episode is my favorite. However, I think it's always funny when a mishap occurs. I always laughed at that. It was a shame that Mrs. Flanders (voice of Maggie Roswell) passed away. Other than that, it's nice that just about every main character has stayed with the show throughout its entire run so far. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gives a good performance, the setting is spectacular, everything about the characters is well-done, and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, I hope this show will always live on in syndication when it finishes its run on FOX.","10","24 January 2006"

That kept them going for about 10 seasons. After season 10 I think the show has gradually lost it's touch. Matt Groening himself even said as the show continues it get's even harder to come up with new original stories. The show isn't even as funny as it was in 1990. In 2006 it still has many funny moments but it feels like ""so what"" After saying that the Simpsons is still one of my all time favorite shows.But because it's lost its touch, I give it a 7.","7","13 May 2006"

"300","What was once one of the greatest shows out has suddenly become a waste of the 8:00 sunday half hour. The Simpsons started out as a skit on The Tracey Ullman back when the FOX network got started in 1986-87, IT SUCKED and the characters and drawings looked like S***marks on paper. Then Came 1989, Still the show sucked but it was bound to get better. That was when Season No. 3 Came. The 1991-92 season, now that was when the show gained it's fame and Simpson Mania was at it's summit worldwide.This was the official show of the 90's. Nobody could deny that for a fact. Especially during the early to mid 90's when the show was No. 1 on sundays. Now sure during that time the show was on thursday and had to compete with Cosby and NBC'S Lineup. But it was bound to thrive and It did.The Last great season for this show I have to say was 1998-99. But after the new writers, or whatever it is, and after the tragedy of Phil Hartman, the show finally began to plummet.I would have to say that this show is getting worse year after year. The worst year being 2001-02 when the show only relied on guest starring celebrities like Carmen Electra, but all im sayin' is to either hire new writers of just cancel the show. This show had it's time in the 90's why keep it now. In fact you what would be better. BRING BACK FAMILY GUY AND PUT Them on at 8pm sunday. That show was better. CANCEL THE SIMPSONS!!",NA,"29 August 2002"
"301","Long Live the King!It is with great sadness that I have reached the conclusion that what was once one of the greatest shows on television has run its course. Recent episodes have traded more on stupidity and slapstick, ignoring the satiric, incisive writing that made it great. Now that I've taken off my rose-colored glasses, I can see that the show was in decline as early as the twelfth season, and possibly a little before.This is still one of my all-time favorite shows; I won't let the mediocre writing of its declining seasons tarnish my memory - unless they KEEP ON with the mediocrity and decline, instead of going for a graceful finish. The Simpsons marketing is so powerful at this point that they don't NEED an active TV series in order to sell merchandise, so please, Fox, surprise me and make a good decision, here. Kill the series and put it in re-runs in the usual time slot. Show the entire series, from the very beginning, and show it in order. I believe it would be a HUGE ratings-getter, even with the DVD sets appearing sporadically.The show may die, but the Simpsons will live forever.",NA,"16 December 2003"

In Spain we get the new chapters every three years and I really missed the new ones till we could watch them in TV. We are suffering even more and more changes in the world and I like a lot to see them captured in that ""particular"" family since 1989, when I was only seven years old. I hope them to continue more and more years. Now we have similar series like ""Family Guy"", great too, with their particular style but showing that this formula have broken that time-limit of life till today. I like some of them too, but I think ""The Simpsons"" are of unequaled style which I like the most. I hope them to continue for too many years. I really hope to.","10","6 November 2006"

"306","There have been a lot of reports recently about the fate of The Simpsons. With Disney acquiring Fox, the longest-running scripted programme in television history is only becoming more prosperous, and it's looking increasingly-likely that the show will continue to run and run well into the next decade. But should it keep going?The Simpsons is my favourite television programme of all time. That sentence used to be perfectly acceptable, but now it must come with a caveat - a tiny asterisk that won't make people think I'm lying or stupid. Here goes: The Simpsons is my favourite television programme of all time**as long as I pretend it ended before the year 2000.Yes, it's fair to say The Simpsons' classic years came to an end around the year I was born. 1997 saw the premiere of such classic episodes as 'The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show', 'Homer's Phobia', and 'Grade School Confidential'. It also saw the premiere of 'Homer's Enemy', a darkly funny and self-referential episode that some people consider the start of the decline (I'm not one of them; the twisted tale of Frank 'Grimey' Grimes is one of the most transgressive stories the show ever told). From there, each season got progressively worse, reaching mediocrity by Season 13 and hitting an all-time low during the HD era. It's astonishing to think a show as beloved and iconic as The Simpsons has been declining in quality for twenty years now - twice as long as the classic years lasted.While America's favourite yellow family still has loyal viewers, it's fair to say the audience has decreased steadily. Ten years ago, the show averaged around seven million viewers in the US. Today, that number has dropped to below three million. Streaming and online services may have taken some of the audience, but even taking that into account, modern Simpsons has lost a hell of a lot of viewers. Personally, I haven't regularly watched the antics of Homer and family in nearly fifteen years; once the HD era kicked, any interest I had in the show went out the window. The animation was flat and boring, the voice acting was disinterested, and the stories grew increasingly tedious and repetitive. Truthfully, I couldn't even tell you the last modern Simpsons episode I watched.All of which brings me back to my original question. Should The Simpsons keep going for years to come?Surprisingly, I think my answer is still yes.Putting aside the fact that The Simpsons is still worth more than sense dictatses, I'm also just not sure I want to live in a world without it. No matter how mediocre it gets, there's still something comforting about knowing Bart and Lisa Simpson are still on TV. This is a show that's been on television since 1989. I was born with The Simpsons. Raised on The Simpsons. Got through my awkward teenage years with The Simpsons (admittedly, that wasn't the main activity that got me through my awkward teenage years). The thought of it one day ending still seems impossible.The future of The Simpsons is far from certain. Will Disney continue to produce it once they've taken over Fox and achieved Hank Scorpio-style world domination? Will the cast still be able to do the voices in a few more years? Julie Kavner is so croaky she's barely audible these days. Now that they've reached thirty seasons, how many more milestones are they prepared to hit? Forty seasons? One-thousand episodes? The last show still being produced on Earth before global warming wipes us out in (insert terrifyingly-soon year here)?Way back in 2002, the episode 'Gump Roast' ended with the song 'They'll Never Stop the Simpsons', which featured Marge becoming a robot and Bart owning a bear. While the writers haven't quite scraped those barrels, we've had Moe owning a talking dish cloth and a bizarre return to Kamp Krusty, so who knows just how many more stories the writers can squeeze out of everyone's favourite yellow family? I won't be watching, but I'm fully behind The Simpsons carrying on infinitum. After all, in life there are only three uncertainties: Death, taxes, and Homer Simpson injuring himself under wacky circumstances.","9","15 January 2020"

"308","I just received the 3rd season on DVD and it's hilarious. I remember reading an article that critcized The Simpsons for being too much like a sitcom. Well, in my opinion, the show was much, much funnier when the plots were somewhat believable. The show now is merely a collection of gags. Bart and Homer were always the dumber members of the family, while Marge and Lisa used to be the sane ones. Now everyone of them acts like goofballs.Some of my favorites are the episode with Ringo Starr and when Marge works at the nuclear plant.

"310","It's 2006. Everyone is talking about the Simpsons now. Mainly because of the teaser that premiered last week. Even the people who thought the Simpson's ""sucked"" tuned in. That's their own opinion. I'm sick of everyone saying how The Simpson's suck. Sure,the jokes are a little less funny, but just because it's not as funny doesn't mean bashing it all day. I recall one message board post saying they were beating a dying dog to death by keeping the show running. Wow, that's cold. If you ask me, The people complaining about the Simpson's sucking are doing more than you would hope to be legal to that poor dead dog. I love the Simpson's. I admit the best episodes were in seasons 5-9, but lay if i don't get every Simpson's season after it's over. If you don't like the Simpson's, Don't come here. The end.","10","7 April 2006"
"311","The other day I realized that quite often, in trying to make a point, I would start a sentence with ""It's kind of like that Simpsons episode, you know where ....""   This show really has managed to hit the mark on just about every aspect of modern American culture, and to make fun of it.  Like the time when they're in the future and Home and Marge are watching TV, and she remarks: ""Fox became a hardcore porno channel so gradually I barely even noticed.""  Ouch--nails the channel for all the sleazy fare they put on.  Or when Sideshow Bob yells out as he's going to jail (pre-Clinton) ""You can't keep me in jail forever! Someday a Democrat will be President and then I'll be out on the street with all my criminal friends!""  Hilarious stuff.
Really the most compelling part of the show is the rich menagerie of characters the writers have been able to produce.  It's kind of like a modern day, funnier version of Dogpatch.  Characters like Dr. Hibbert, with his inane chuckle and ridiculous Cosbyish sweaters, or Patty and Selma, the DMV workers from hell, or Cletus the slack-jawed yokel, Dr. John Frink--a total take off of Jerry Lewis in the Nutty Professor, the list just goes on and on.  And of course, at the center of all the mania is Homer Simpson, my nomination for man of the decade; so impossibly stupid that even though a cartoon, no matter how foolish or idiotic we men may behave, we can always say, ""well at least there's somebody dumber than me."" It sometimes falls flat or rings hollow, but only rarely (the time Marge considers having an affair.  Marge?  I don't believe it)  But there are very few TV shows that have been on for as long and that have remained as fresh and consistently funny as this one.  How many shows can you say have been able to include references to both the profound, as in ""Lord of the Flies"", Poe's ""The Raven,"" and the popular: Star Trek, Raiders of the Lost Ark? They come at such a machine gun pace, it's hard to keep up. 
Hope it keeps on going, though it really lost a big chunk of its charm with the passing of Phil Hartman (we all lost).  Without Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz, something definitely missing.",NA,"13 December 2000"
"312","The Simpsons started off with the antics of Bart and slowly drifted over to Homer being the center of attention. I first liked the Simpson's because they were a primetime cartoon.  They were saying profane words that any cartoon hadn't said before,  but they still managed to pull it off so it was funny unlike some of the other run of the mill mature cartoons.  People have grown to love some the characters during the show's 14 season run, including my self.  I think the show will continue to make people laugh for another 14 seasons possibly more. :-)","10","15 January 2003"
"313","I used to like the Simpsons during their first seven years on TV, but now, especially with new episodes, it just seems so much annoying rather than funny.  It's always the same d'oh for Homer, the same 'mmm...' for marge, the same 'hokily dokily' for Flanders, basically it's just the same plot, which makes the show even more annoying.  And here in Montreal, we get it twice a day on weekdays on channel 22, 45, and 49, and  once a day on weekdays on channel 5, and 13. five times on weekends on channel three (including the new episodes) four times on weekends on 45 and 49.

"314","Who doesn't like The Simpsons? This adult cartoon (yes, it is mainly for adults) is one of the best cartoons out there. The Simpson's began in 1987 or 1989. What had it's origins as a late night controversial adult animated television series has now become wildly accepted for both young and old alike. The series follows the lives of the Simpson family and their awesome community (that I would love to live in). The town is Springfield and there never is a dull moment. Whether it's Bart getting in trouble at school, or Homer screwing up in some way or another, there is a reason this series has been running so long. The series really brings out the human condition and many other aspects such as television, society and culture. Creator Matt Groening based the Simpson family on his own family and Bart was to portray Groening. The series has won several awards and in today's world it is a nice escape to watch the Simpsons and realize things aren't really as bad as they seem. - Asif Zamir","10","3 December 2013"
"315","This title which is not already finished is a brilliant art of Matt Groening.It is a great achievement which i saw when it first came out here in Greece.In my opinion,i liked the particular title because it is funny,it explains and informs us many historical things of America and it warns about dangerous things in our daily life.Also,some of my friends who are interested in movies and animated television(t.v)series told me that it is not as good as other series.They justified that it contains black comedy scenes,the comedy is not so good and generally the movie is bad-created.Finally,for me the best and the funniest episodes are from the seasons 1-10 and the other seasons are not so funny.Brilliant effort to the creator of these series.I wish to come out other television animated series like this one!Great Job!!!!","10","18 August 2009"
"316","The Simpsons has become one of television's longest running animated productions: from 1989 to now, the show has become a longstanding icon leaving its mark on entertainment history with style. The Simpsons family has become synonymous with television animation everywhere: Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie are wonderfully rounded characters that are arguably as recognisable as Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse. In fact the whole town of Springfield's cast for characters have become timeless television icons themselves: you've now got your Flanders archetypes, the overly critical teacher archetypes of Skinner and Ms Krabappel, the nerdy Comic Book Guy, the selfish billionaire circa Mr Burns, the donut loving cop via Chief Wiggum and the bully archetype Nelson. The show's stories vary from being Simpsons centric to focusing on supporting characters instead: it's a sitcom that's become a fixture for the animated sitcom in Hollywood.Need I say more? Sure the later seasons don't hold up as well as the earlier ones do, but it's still a fun time nonetheless.The Simpsons is classic stuff.","9","24 October 2020"
"317","The Simpsons Season 13 just came out in Denmark. What can you say? Who knew it would have lasted this long. Flintstone episodes (160) times three. Unbelievable.The old producers, animators and writers are still hanging in there, providing insightful commentary, not just the audio kind, but in every aspect, be it social, pop or historical with a lot of insanity thrown in.I do read comments on the internet and I totally agree with the writers that they are sometimes nasty and unfair. They have criticised Mike Scully (show runner season 9-12) of ruining the show. They have criticised Al Jean for being self serving, when he put another character from a different show into the Simpsons. Come on, what do we want? I loved that insane humour of George Meyer and Mike Scully. Where else but animated shows can you show a male character try nurse a doll and a billionaire try catch the Loch Ness monster. This is animation for C....sakes. Why not have a little fun with it? Reality shows have taken over the fun you used to have escaping from that reality. Now to survive we get shows with some kind of horror or supernatural element that mostly rely on special effects, not well written stories. That's fine, but we need good comedy as well. Most of the sitcoms today does not have any edge to them.So, let's hope we all learn to stop complaining (ironically I did just slam sitcoms and space shows) but as Homer would say: Yeah, but what are you gonna do? Congratulations on beating every record there is in showbiz, Mr Scully, Mr Jean and all animators who were ever involved with the Simpsons.By the way, I am a nerd when it comes to the Simpsons. I do tend to groan when I see something not consistent with character development. But I have never said: ""Worst Episode Ever"" - Oh, s...! I just said it.","5","11 February 2005"

"319","The Simpson's is and will be remembered as one of TV's best ever shows, but for me it would have been the best...if not for the later seasons. I don't exactly know when it was the show started to deteriorate, maybe after the 10 year mark...maybe when Phil Hartman died (RIP) I'm not sure. The Simpson's first season was crude, but the potential was there. The second season kicked off and the show was improved, and again in the third season the show was improved...but the fourth season, for me was the Simpson's strongest...it was consistently funny, it had some of the greatest one liners ever and they didn't over do the physical humour. The attention had changed form Bart to Homer, which was good...Homer is one of the best creations ever , especially in season 4...he was dumb, but just so funny. Anyways, the show continued and was great, but as i said before...there was a point were it just was not that funny anymore. Homer has become loud and annoying and just isn't the character he once was, even the shows older writers admit this. The storylines really are clutching at straws and i do not watch the new seasons...i prefer to just watch earlier season. Matt Groening should have stopped it earlier but i guess all he could see was the money...and the show is a complete sell out now, I'm not interested in `The Simpson's bath towel's' or `The Simpson's video car racing'....it breaks my heart at what the show has become because it was my favourite show of all time...for a long time.

"323","The Simpsons has been increasingly maligned for the past twenty years and frankly, justifiably so. But there's a reason this long-running show gets more flack for a decline in quality than any other: during its' first decade, which is what I've based my ten stars on, this was the greatest American sitcom of all-time and one of the greatest ever made worldwide.In the '90s, this show could make you howl with laughter, but occasionally warm or even break your heart. Back then, celebrity guests were used wisely and sparingly, rather than just being written into lackluster scenarios for the sake of having them. It was thoughtful in a way that most U.S. shows could not grasp and they made no secret of their awareness of that fact, which endeared them to the public even more.Advice to new viewers: stick to seasons 1-8, 9 and 10 are a decent encore. There, you'll find this once colossal show in its' original brilliant form.","10","2 January 2020"

"325","anyone who thinks this cartoon isn't that great, then i don't know why you even bother watching anything else, because the Simpson is one of the most longest and one of the most best cartoon ever. Also, the cartoon has all the things it needs, like comedy, a big dumb, fat, lazy idiot, an smart person, a bad kid, a caring mom, and also a lot of great stories for each episodes. I think its kinda incredible to see the creaters to put together a really funny cartoon, and last for a long time. also, i think its kinda funny whenever homer Simpson kept saying do'h and kept on almost dying in a lot of the episodes. Sometimes, i think it would be pretty funny if i actually see homer dies, and goes to hell, and actually make an episode about that. Oh, and also, i think Marge is kinda stupid looking, because of that hair of hers, i mean, like whats up with her hair anyways?? because that hair is just really bad. anyways, overall, i think that the Simpson is one of the best cartoons there will ever be, and i think the creaters will keep on making new episodes until there's absolutely no actors/actress anymore to replace them.PS. i would've given this 12/10, but 10 is the highest score i could give it on this.","10","17 September 2006"
"326","Finally... worked through all 28 seasons of ""The Simpsons"" (618 episodes and 1 movie to date). A rocky road, with the first ten seasons being the best ""classic"" or Golden years period. Then it went downhill with many unfunny, clichd or just plain boring seasons for a few years. Hasn't really picked up again as well as it could, but did improve eventually. I think ""South Park"" has done better at keeping up with social events and remaining consistent.","8","17 December 2017"

They had great characters, story lines, humor, etc. After that, it became way too ""far fetched."" Now days, episodes are way too unrealistic. I know it's just a cartoon, but it used to seem possible. Suddenly, they got new writers, new story lines, and changed the plot. Ever since, the things done on the show have become so bogus and bizarre, nothing is enjoyable anymore. In the old days, this show made you think about how dumb everyday people are sometimes. NOW, dumb people seem smart compared to how dumb and unrealistic this show can be. My recommendation: Get seasons 1-13 on DVD, and avoid ever watching any new episodes.

"328","Let me first say, that I am a HUGE fan of this show, but I think that it (unfortunately) is starting to go down hill. When I say that, i simply mean that The Simpsons has started to repeat itself badly. It's always the same things that happens to/with characters. Let me give a couple of examples:Homer: Still as bald, fat, stupid and caring as he was from the start. He still tries to strangle Bart, and still tries to make Lisa happy. He drinks as he have done all the time, he keeps on doing the most stupid things when he has spend a couple of hours at Moe's and so on.Conclusion: Does the same (BORING) stuff all the time.Marge: She is one the most boring characters in The Simpsons, and will never be anything else. And you can't even say that she keeps on doing the same BORING stuff, because she doesn't do A THING. She has always been sitting around at home, trying to be ""the head of the family."" Okay, through her life she have had a couple of jobs, but how many? 4 or 5? And for how long has she been able to keep those job? One episode.Conclusion: She never really does anything, so I gues that there is no conclusion...I could keep going on like this for a lot longer, but I am sure we all have other things to do, so I am just gonna say one more thing.
I admit that The Simpsons is one of the greatest shows ever made, but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STOP IT. It is starting to get so-so.... BORING. I mean, when the episode where Flanders dated a movie star were send, I just sad through the hole episode and HOPED that his relationship with her would evolve into something, but (of course) it didn't. And that was my opinion ;)",NA,"18 November 2003"
"329","Simply put, the best. Each show is funny and intelligent, and have jokes that nobody else could have ever thought up. Sheer brilliance. Even if it is sinking a little now, it's still funny. People are just dissapointed that it doesn't live up to the standards of the classic episodes, but it doesn't mean that they SUCK or should be CANCELLED, entirely. Keep going as long as possible Simpsons, I support you!!",NA,"7 March 2003"
"330","WARNING: Possible spoilers if you click on the video or read this review. This show was one of the greatest shows of all time. Funny jokes, emotional appeal, all of that. But now it turned to crap. This video explains all of it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqFNbCcyFkk you can see how it made the best show ever, but turned into what it didn't want to be. It needs to change, or it needs to end. If none of this happens in the coming years. Its going to get worse and worse tainting its name fully from funny animated sitcom to ugh is this show still on? Fox I believe has a contract lasting till' season 30. So if at the end of season 30 it ends, don't be surprised. But also don't be surprised if it doesn't. Fox is milking it dry, and will keep milking it until there's nothing to milk. What I'm saying is that Fox won't cancel it until it starts to not make a profit from the show. And its coming soon. There are too many shows that are too good instead of what this has now become. Watch a different cartoon. BoJack Horseman, F is for Family, or even Early Simpsons. But not the smut that is still existing and needs to be put to rest.","6","16 August 2017"
"331","Hi, I'm from Mexico, and I just want to say something that everyone knows. This is the best show ever and I think when I'll birth 80 years (Im 20 now) this show will be standing yet, like the Flinstones right now. I love that chapter when Homer thinks that Mr. Burns is an alien, and Molder and Scully take place in Springfield. I remember when I was five (1990) I saw that chapter when a babysitter takes care of Bart, Lisa and Maggie, and she try to rob the house. Since then I never stopped watching this show. I know this could sound like too much X-generation, but the best moments of my life have a relation with some quote of the Simpsons. Hey, and let me tell you something: Here in Mexico is sold the Duff beer! But is not like the Australian Duff beer. Is the Duff beer of The Simpsons! Believe it or not! Same logo, same colors. I saw an interview with the guy that has the idea of selling Duff beer because Matt Groening never registered Duff as a trade mark. And he said something that is really true: Duff has about 17 years of free publicity. Interesting, all right? Well, everybody knows this is the favorite family in the World!","10","15 September 2006"

"333","It always feels like something semi-religious is going on behind the scenes on this show, even if the creators try hard to make it fast-paced and daring at times. Like a lot of shows, it churns out a true conventionalism and a dont-make-waves approach toward the viewer. It is revealing itself to be more conservative than controversial, so as to not lose any of the misdirected praise or adulation - truly, Daring is not a word for The Simpsons.  Is it funny ? Not really. Do they have funny voices ? Well, some of them, yes. Could they stand to be compared to say, Duckman ? Sure, when hell freezes over, because a show like Duckman is Truly Hilarious, with great characters and intensely funny scripts - try and find the equivalence to the drool-bucket in any Simpson-episode if you can - No ? I am not surprised. Great Comedy. The only outstanding character in The Simpsons is Monty Burns. They should cancel everything else and give him the chance to shine in all his corrupt selfishness.

"335","I am one of the most elaborate Simpson fans of all time in my opinion. I have watched every episodde before season 12 possibly a dozen times and will stand by saying it was the greatest show ever. Yet the true question is how many shows run for fifteen years... Almost none if any and that simply is becasue after time they are ruined. The greatest show ever is simply not funny any more. I struggle to watch the new material. All I can say is get the first half dozen seasons all the way up to even season nine, anything after that is nothing more then a waste of air time taking up space that was once occupied by great shows now cancelled such as Family Guy, Andy Richter and so on. Which none of lasted more then four seasons or so.",NA,"4 July 2003"
"336","The Simpsons is one of the greatest shows ever, but it needs to step down now. Since season 9 or so, it's been an almost total waste of time. The writers seemed to know this originally, and poked fun at themselves for it. But how many times is this sort of self-deprecation funny when they aren't actually doing anything to make the show better? Older Simpsons episodes are full of lovable, funny characters, but more recent ones are awful. Homer becomes selfish, stupid, and mean--sure, he was stupid before, but sweet--Lisa is a boring, one-dimensional caricature of her clever, formal self, and Marge practically ceases to exist except to occasionally utter her trademark grumble. (Oh, and the parade of guest stars only makes things worse.) The show is just embarrassing now. The first years of it, though, are simply some of the funniest stuff ever to grace a TV screen. An open plea to the writers and producers--please, for the sake of your biggest fans, please let the show die.Oh, and...go banana!",NA,"28 December 2004"

"338","The Simpsons Graced the Australian screen for the very first time in 1992. At first it was dismissed as merely another trashy American cartoon with poor animation, and its popularity was surpassed by the mindless ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.""  Today, it is already an animation classic that stands on par with Japanese Anime like ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" in sheer depth of storyline, voice acting and lovable characters who touch our hearts with their humanity (Three cheers for Lisa Simpson and Krusty the Clown!). And for an American Cartoon to equal Japanese Anime, ""The Simpsons"" is a true triumph of a show.",NA,"1 April 1999"
"339","There was one time, around about season 7, when every episode would have me laughing so hard I'd cry, the jokes were hilarious, the gags were very funny, and every character was brilliant and unique. For example, the episode with the Movementarians, that episode has to be one of the funniest episodes of any show ever. Lately however, it seems to have gone down the pan. The jokes seem less quality, the story lines are getting TOO far fetched and just not good. Now I would only get a couple of small chuckles from each episode, where as 10 years ago, every episode would be filled with brilliance, brimming with brilliance and so many laughs you would cry, no though, I feel it may be time to put the old dog down.","9","27 May 2006"

"341","The impact those classic simpsons episodes had on my family, friends, and even random people in the school bus yelling out quotes after quotes from the show. We were addicted. I was put in detention for replying ""Excellent...."" like Mr.Burns in the 10th grade when our French teacher said ""tomorrow is the only day in the schedule where we don't have class together"", everyone burst out laughing and he sent about a third of the class with me so we ended up having to stay in the library for a week.Me and my younger brother spent countless hours watching the show, in English and the Quebec French version, we would learn our English faster than most kids thanks to that show thanks to the close captions.The show became more silly and tried to emulate FOX's new big hit (undeservedly so, imo) Family Guy, which was plagiarissimo of the actual show. Homer turning into a Peter Griffin for season 11 in particular sucked, season 11 even had an episode that was made terrible on purpose (even the Comic book store Guy was wearing a ""Worst Episode Ever"" t-shirt when seen. That was the episode with the horse jockeys turning out to be underground elves or whatever....that would be okay if it was Futurama, bless that show, but that was the Simpsons.Al Jean took back control of the show and the next few seasons were hit or miss, it was a new thing to only like about half a season, but s12-13-14-15-16 were like that, still worth watching most of the episodes, but there wasn't anything as funny as it was when the show's main purpose was to make us laugh, with its humour being so ""twisted"", our teachers had us sign petitions to remove the Simpsons from the Quebec French TV channel that was broadcasting it, in the early 90's, I didn't sign it and passed, although then, I didn't find the show that funny, I got into it big time when I grew up just at the perfect space-time, when season 5 premiered, we were doing homework me and my brother and my mother was doing laundry and helping out in the livingroom and we just happened to flick channels to what was playing...the highly regarded ""Cape Fear"". ""This coffee's too hot!"" Before that, I was a bit too young and season 1-2 jokes flew right over my head.A true critic of the nuclear family, but at the same time, reinforcing the fact that there's nothing like family, it is all that matters, everyone without a family is either a really sad/mad/insane person in the show (pretty much). My fav seasons? Season 5,6 and 8 are memorable to this day. My girlfriend can come back from work and launch a quote to me and I'll reply ""you spent 5200 dollars on beer?!?!"" as regular small talk.I don't know what the show is past season 32, without Azaria...I don't know what 20th century Television is, but it seems to me like all voice actors were changed and thus for bad reasons. The Apu fiasco, when the character has been integral and practically fully Americanized ever since we saw him. He's the coach of a pee-wee hockey team ffs. Azaria voicing Carl like a black guy despte being white and not wanting to do it anymore....the show has become what it always mocked, political correctness, false value signaling (I hate that expression but it is what it is). I haven't seen much past season 16, I started watching s17 and by then I was more interested in the golden age of South Park (season 5-10...be honest, SP being known by the general public as what it was in the first 3 seasons are annoying and don't get how smart the show became...while keeping some of the ridiculous and grotesque humour at the same time).Last product from the Simpsons I thoroughly enjoyed was the Movie. It felt like great closure to me, sure it did employ some tropes from some episodes, but it is very prescient of where the world was going....your house or if luckier like me, your city my be ""the Dome"". It shows that they had put a lot of effort into it, having worked on it in secret for a good while I understand.But I agree with those speaking of the ""Zombie Simpsons"" by now, they should have stopped after season 20 if they wanted to get to a nice round number....now the real last season is season 32 and that new fac simile of season 33+ I will not watch, when I heard Azaria quit and the voice actress for Martin died and Mrs. Kavner not being sure she could do it anymore at her very advanced age.I think that the show was able to bounce from the general failure that was season 11-12 (don't get me wrong, some of those seasons have some great A+ episodes, but we were used to A+ all the time...) when Matt was forced to stop supervising Futurama due to FOX almost destroying the show and some old writers being brought back into the fold (Matt Selman. Dan Greaney even George Meyers was back and he hadn't written an episode in a very long time). When he left to supervise Futurama again, it showed, and it was painful.They could have quit before all this cancel culture s**** and the rebirth of extreme PCness (causing the Streisand effect and bringing us the President we still have for a month).So I bow to you, Matt, Al, David Mirkin, Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein, John Swartzwelder and even Mike Scully, you did write funny episodes but you were the worst executive producer. As for you Mr.Swartzwelder you wrote 150+ episodes in those first 15 first seasons and almost every line is etched into my brain and I manage to make people laugh by classic-simpsonizing my speech to people I suspect will not get it (too young or like many quit watching after season 11-12 and forgot a lot about the show), and so many of your episodes are among the best in each season, your name should be as well known as Matt's!I could go on, but I think anyone reading this knows where I could go next. Thanks for bringing me all this joy in the rocky times that was my teenage years and still doing it because the show (without syndication cuts) is played on a canadian channel, 2 shows in a row from 4:30PM to 5:30PM, so when the cycle of the translated for Quebec show hits its ceiling (extremely high quality voice casting, to anyone doubtful, compare the Quebec French voices for each character, they really did a great job). I also got some seasons on DVD, but some dingbat stole my season 1-2-3 DVD cases, good luck getting a season 1 DVD pack these days for a price that makes sense)...the actor speaking for Homer died and they decided to quit when season 27 was translated. The man is as not replaceable, just like Dan Castellenetta is to the original.","10","18 December 2020"

The actors don't care as much, to much censorship (they even took out Apu for the complaints) which was a sign the creators had lost their nerve, they are to political and try to hard to adapt to an SJW world. Enough is enough. Please kill this show with mercy. It had a great run, but it's time. Thank you though, still give it a collective 7","8","19 February 2020"

Homer can be a little too much at times.  The show pushes against Political correctness to the limit.  The only weak character is the Doctor, I know it is a poke at ""the cosby show"" but hey that show has been off the air for over 11 year and a lot of viewers miss that punch line.  It's getting too old.  My favorite episode is the time travel one with Homer.  Only problem, with the show's popularity, is the over play of reruns.  I am starting to become sick of the over played episodes, and it will become another MASH.  MASH used to be shown 7 days a week like the the Simpsons.

I have no idea why I didn't stick with this show, even as I grew up with it, but I've certainly made up for lost time, and it's become one of my favorite series. The array of memorable characters, the sly wit, it's all here and consistently funny - which is not something I can say about any other FOX animated sitcom. One other thing: Hank Azaria is an American treasure. The series itself is a showcase of incredible talent (Shearer and Castellaneta, especially), but it's Azaria's characters that tend to be my favorite (Moe and Chief Wiggum). I love that Wiggum is a bad Edward G. Robison impression, and he never says something that's not funny. 9/10","9","14 October 2014"

If I had to pick a favorite episode, there'd be way to many for me to name. But one of my favorite episodes is the one when Bart created the Angry Dad comic. I laugh and laugh every time I see that one. It amazes me that The Simpsons has been on the air for 16 years. I remember thinking it would maybe last a year or two, but it's having an awesome run.

"351","I propose the duel series theory to everyone who loves The Simpsons. This is a way one could also continue to love this proposed idea.It is common knowledge that the series took a dive around season 10. And by dive I mean they changed course, Homer got a little more less intelligent and the episodes seemed to have only half the heart.Now for the idea that we treat The Simpsons with a duel ideology. On one side there is the golden standard of The Simpsons and probably television in the 90s, which ended in the middle of season 10. After that we are greeted by a different show. A new retelling of the show even. This is the zany and crazy Simpsons. It is the point where the show became so huge it had to do something different to keep people watching. The story lines became wacky and disposable. Case in point can you quote more lines pre season 10 or post season 10? Are there lines worth remembering? Ask yourself that.After season 10 we are given a sitcom where crazy ideas are thrown around. Homer has a different job every week and character who were had very tiny roles are now given bigger and more time. Also, this is the time when Apu is hardly seen and heard even less. The new Homer has no time to visit the KwikiMart because he is doing all these crazy jobs. Comic Book Guy, Grounds Keeper Willie, Profesor Frink and Ralph are becoming more mainstay. They are given a line in nearly every episode just so they can get a cheep laugh, but is it memorable? Hardly.Next case, think about memorable Ralph lines. Then find out where those lines came from? They are prior to season 10 and this new consistent Ralph is less memorable.Even amazingly good episodes like Eternal Moonshine from this season lacks the pop to be memorable. Sure it was a very well done episode and we all know it because it was recent, but a few years down the road will you remember anything from it other than the plot? Will you remember the dialogue that made it so good? To be completely honest the only episode with lines that are worthy of remembering are from The President Wore Pearls episode and that was because it was done via catchy and good song parady.I know a lot of you are going to disagree with what I'm saying. You will call it all classic and call me crazy and saying I just have a small brain and cannot remember the lines and the stories. But I ask you to sit for a minute and think. Can you recall 100 moments after season 10? 50? 25? 15? There are 200 episodes to choose from, can you do it? Now I'm not saying it was bad after season 10, I still watch every new episode with my friends like I did 7 years ago and I still laugh, the show has always been funny. I'm not saying it hasn't been. I'm just saying it's not a memorable type of humor. I will always cherish seasons 1-9. They are my childhood and I will always see seasons 10-whenever as the show that continued in place of the Golden Age of The Simpsons. Which is The Simpsons, but still feels like a different series within the series.","10","31 January 2008"

"354","I watched ""The Simpsons"" for three or four seasons, and stopped when I sensed that grotesque satire was taking the place of proper characterization and plotting. These days, you never know what on Earth you're going to see if you tune in to this show...Though there are many, many hilarious episodes, I have to say that my final impression of ""The Simpsons"" is somehow negative. Maybe I'm just tired of people who think that dropping quotes from the Monorail episode into casual conversation is the height of wit. In the past, sarcasm was actually labeled the lowest form of wit - and that just about pegs this show. Clever, yes, to a degree. Good, to a point. But also most definitely tiresome, especially after so long, and not really worthwhile on any substantive level. Like the Catholic church, I think ""The Simpsons"" went wrong when it stopped attacking institutions and became an institution itself! It's now every bit as bloated and bad as the things it mocks. Too bad, since it started out as an honest and sometimes even insightful critique of the middle class.",NA,"5 December 2004"
"355","Ive heard a lot of complaining about the new episodes of the Simpsons lately. Everyone says the show isnt as good as it used to be in the 3rd and 4th seasons. Well, Ill have to disagree.Sure, it may not have such great stories as ten years a go, and the jokes may not be as funny as they were in the episodes 8 years ago, but at least I cant find another sitcom, animated OR acted that still makes me laugh at least once during an episode. All comedies get unfunny during time. Even Monty Pythons Flying Circus became dull in the fourth season. But the Simpsons was still keep on making at least one viewer (me) laugh.
Okay, the show was a bit annoying in seasons 9-11, when the writers must have all shoved crayons up their noses, because they came up with such ideas as Mr. Burns searching for the Loch Ness monster so that he could be loved, Homer refusing to donate a kidney to save his fathers life and the Simpsons killing an alligator and then running from the law. But nowadays the quality has improved. Some of my favorite episodes are from recent two seasons (In Finland we are currently seeing season 14); ""I am furious yellow"", where Bart starts drawing a comic called ""Angry Dad"", which is based on Homer ""Poppas got a brand new badge"", where Homer starts his own security company, but angries up the mafia and ""Bart vs. Lisa vs. the 3rd grade"", where Bart and Lisa get transferred to the same 3rd grade class, where Bart is a succesful student and Lisa is not.All of you who do not like the series any more do not have to watch new episodes, and if they do still watch the show, they might as well shut the hell up.

"356","The Simpsons, this is a show that has overcome so many odds, and still has been one of the best shows to even hit a television. The Simpsons was the funniest, most original show you could find on TV. I used to watch the show at LEAST 5 times a day, I always needed my daily Simpson's buzz. The best of seasons were from 4 to 8, that is when they were at their funniest and most creative. But as the seasons went on, the show started to lose it's edge.Now going to season 17, I don't think I can bear to watch the show anymore. It hurts me so much to see a show that I have been watching my whole life, crumble down like Michael Jackson's empire. The last season was absolutely horrendous, it was the worst season yet! I do admit, though, there were a few good episodes, like when Homer smuggled drugs from Canada... but this season, the bad episodes overcame the good episodes. They have been starting to run out of idea's since season 12, but it definitely showed on this season. They need to get some of their best writers back, people like Conan O'Brien, or Bill Oakley, they were some of the best writers that the show has ever seen. Now that most of their people have gone, the show has crumbled in to nothing.It is so sad to see such a classic fall like this, but there is still hope... today, I just bought season 6 on DVD, and I can now enjoy what was once some of the funniest episodes ever, anytime I want. I will still always love the classic episodes, and I will still watch the new episodes (because I am a hardcore Simpson's fan), but the show should end now, it's getting to the point where it is unbearable to watch. Please Groening, just let it go, you are meddling with a classic.Overall, I would give the show: ********/10 stars, the show may have a lot of bad episodes, but there are too many good ones to ruin this show for me.Please end it...","10","19 August 2005"

Since The Simpsons have become pretty bad lately and been on the air so long, I guess the show should just be canceled and the episodes after 1995 or 1996 should be burned because they just aren't funny and/or poignant.",NA,"25 January 2002"

Like Ex: Season 4 a brilliant episode entitled ""lisas first word"" Everything in that was perfect a 9.9 episode in my opinion,it had family value and a very funny enjoyable episode.Now look at season 10 Monty cant buy me love..Mr burns trys to get the loch ness monster then once taken to Springfield,he causes a fire and gets a job at the casino(WTF).Fair play to Matt he made the Simpsons perfectly but it should of stopped by season 10 maybe 9,im sure many other people think this.But eventually i sold all my seasons of the Simpsons and started watching futurama which i wont go on to now...","7","4 August 2007"

"361","This show really knows how to make clever jokes that some kids would not get but overall its not bad but maybe not the best for ages 6-12 may contain some adult jokes that would totally fly over kids heads but overall such a classic.","10","2 August 2018"
"362","The Simpsons is a show that has been around for two decades and still going strong, it shows the American life; or did at the beginning now its just plain fun with movie parodies or shows. The show is based around the Simpson family which consists of five main characters, Homer, Marge, Bart; Lisa and Maggie. The residents of Springfield also make appearances and form most of the show.The show is just plain fun and will cheer you up with its crazy story lines and hilarious characters as well its laugh out loud dialogue mainly coming from Homer Simpsons.My favourite episode is 'Who shot Mr. burns? Part 1 and 2'; the outcome is shocking and far fetched but still works..The Simpsons has become an iconic show with its larger then life characters, may they continue to strive....","10","1 November 2008"
"363","Although the current seasons are debatable, this show is one of the best in television history in my opinion. This show has made me a fan of Mat Groening's shows. I would definitely recommend it.","10","1 January 2019"
"364","The Simpsons is the story about Homer Simpson & his family which consists of his wife, Marge, his son, Bart & his two daughters, Lisa & Maggie, in the fictional city of Springfield. The animation of this show is very unique, as all the characters are yellow in color! The Simpson family are a weird lot, because of the different values of each member of the family. Homer is a lazy & obese man, who works at a nuclear power plant. Apart from work, he mostly spends time at Moe's Tavern with his buddies. He loves his wife but, he sometimes gets annoyed due to the burden, of raising three children. Marge is Homer's caring wife & mother of three. Marge loves her family but she sometimes gets sad & angry because of Homer's forgetfulness, his careless attitude towards the kids & his excessive drinking. Bart, is a mischievous ten year old who loves causing trouble wherever he goes. He is the most notorious boy at school & his parents keep getting called to meet the principal, Skinner. Lisa is a very intelligent & kind girl. She's just the opposite of Bart. High grades, hates causing trouble & has no friends. Maggie is an infant, who hasn't learned to speak yet & is addicted to her pacifier which she keeps sucking. Some supporting characters include, Homer's religious neighbor Ned Flanders. Springfield police head, Chief Wiggum. Kwik-E-Mart owner Apu, who is an Indian. And a few others like, Marge's sisters Selma & Patty, Bart's best friend, Milhouse, who has always had a huge crush on Lisa(she doesn't reciprocate his feelings though). Nelson, Springfield Elementary School's(Bart & Lisa's school) chief bully. Moe's Tavern owner, Moe. He's an extremely ugly guy who hangs out with Homer & his friends, Lenny, Carl & Barney. He's also unlucky with women & is attracted to Marge & last but not the least Principal Skinner(principal of Springfield Elementary).Each character is unique & hilarious in their own ways. However, The Simpsons would not have been possible without the brilliant Homer Simpson. Bart, is another highlight of the show because of his mischievous pranks. Hilarious supporting characters include, Moe, Apu, Nelson, Ralph & Chief Wiggum. Dan Castellaneta has done a mind blowing job in his voice over of Homer. Julie Kavner is impressive as the voice of Marge. Nancy Cartwright has done an outstanding job in her voice variations of different 10 year old boys, Bart & Nelson to name a few. Yeardley Smith is effective as Lisa. Hank Azaria is just epic as the voices of Moe, Chief Wiggum & Apu. Harry Shearer is brilliant as the voices of Mr.Burns & Flanders. So to sum it up, The Simpsons is a must watch. Laugh till your sides hurt, while watching the events unfold in the colorful city of Springfield.","10","26 April 2012"

"366","I was born in the early nineties and this show was on then and its still on to this day. I remember being a little kid watching it with my mom and I loved it. It was so funny and original totally explains why it has lasted over twenty long years! The voice actors do a great job and the writers are so talented. They make hilarious episodes with jokes and satire. I personally think the earlier episodes of the show were funnier such as seasons 3-12 but they are still funny to this day. 22 years and 500 episodes later and I am still watching this show.This show follows a dysfunctional family of 5, Homer,Marge,Bart,Lisa and maggie. They get into crazy shinnanigans every week and its hilarious every time.I have watched this show for my whole life and I will continue to watch it for as long as its on. Maybe it will never end and I will sit down with my kids and watch it just as I did with my parents. The simpsons is a part of my childhood a part of my memory thank you simpson family for being a part of my life.","8","16 November 2012"

"369","The Simpsons is the best semi adult cartoon in the history of television and altho it does appeal to kids, adults love it to, Matt Groening is a complete genius for inventing this amazing show and although the new episodes suck a bit, it doesn't ruin what The Simpsons was: Here i will explain a bit about each member of the family and see where the show went by changing them!Homer .j. Simpson: Homer is the best character because of his constant stupidity and his lack of understanding Lisa' smartness and always been outsmarting him i.e ""Mental note, the girl knows to much"" you can see that he is proud of all his family but at the same time doesn't want be in the same room as them! Dan Cassenella is a genius! i don't like the new Simpsons Homer because they have made him smarter and his voice sounds dumber and i cant watch it because its sad, what they've done to him!Marge Simpson: She is the perfect housewife, does chores looks after the kids and cooks, thats Marge Simpson for you! She may have the occasional murmur but Marge is great, its funny when you that Moe has a huge crush on her and tries to hide it from Homer, but deep down i think that Homer knows! The problem now i have with this character is that Julie Kavner has made her voice sound more screechy and it kinda gets on my nerves because of thatBart and Lisa Simpson: i want to say something about them together so i'll put them together! Bart and Lisa are a great bro and sis and sometimes i wish that i could be related to them!! Bart has always been my fav because Nancy Cartwright is amazing and even tho she does Chuckie from 'All Grown up!' and 'Rugrats' you can sometimes hear Bart when Chuckie laughs and talks, anyway the problem that i now have with Bart is what i have always hated Lisa for, being a goody two shoes and he never plays pranks anymore and now Bart bores me! Lisa is an OK character but in the early seasons her voice always went through me because it was high pitched and squeaky but over the years Yeardly Smith improved the voice and its a nice voice, Lisa hasn't really changed much except some how she knows everyone in Springfield and shes also a bit dumber as well (whats up with that), the main problem i have with these two is that they never fight as much as they used to which sucks a bit! i wont do Maggie because not much to say, except shes never init anymore she always disappears!! random!Overall i still love this show even tho the writers have lost their touch and all they do is rehash old story lines and give it a new title, also trying to shock people i.e Making Patty in a lesbian, not very shocking, i can't believe they are making a movie, i cant wait but i think that i may be disappointed as well!i give this 10/10 because it will always be great and i will never stop watching it!","10","20 June 2005"
"370","When I saw the Simpsons show I was really into it and entertained and I thought the show was hilarious. I enjoyed and loved some of the jokes they had, but as the show progressed it got offensive by it started bashing God and Jesus and I am a man of faith. I couldn't watch the show anymore because of the things the show said. After I still gave it a chance and stayed open minded and tried not to judge it, but the things the movie said made me uncomfortable. So I am writing this review to say that I would've enjoyed it, if only the bashing of not only my families beliefs, but also, other people's beliefs in a higher power wasn't thrown as jokes like that. It's fine to have your own opinions, but don't bash people's beliefs. That's messed up. All in all, I would never watch the show or movie again.","3","26 May 2015"
"371","The Simpsons are by and far the best and most entertaining show on Television.  They are a breath of fresh air compared to the other shows on TV which are all ripoffs of each other with the same predictable jokes over and over again.  Also unlike most other shows on TV they seem to be getting better and better every year instead of worst.",NA,"23 January 2000"
"372","Nearley everyone in the world has heard of The Simpsons, classified by many as the greatest cartoon of all time. The Simpsons started out life as a little cartoon show on ""The Tracy Ulman Show."" The very first episode of The Simpsons was called ""Goodnight Simpsons."" As the years went by, so did the cartoon. In 1989,the very first full episode of The Simpsons was broadcasted, the episode known as ""The Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire."" The episode was very successful and throughout the years The Simpsons became more successful. Personally, I think The Simpsons is probably the best cartoon ever made. The Simpsons is of course extremely funny. The Simpsons also has the power to go deeply into the emotional side, dealing with issues like marriage,death, divorce, etc. There is really know need for me to mention the names of the characters, because most people reading this will know who the characters are. These times, The Simpsons maybe having hard competition with Family Guy, which is slowly creeping up on The Simpsons. The Simpsons movie is coming out on the 27th July 2007, I hope that it is as good as the T.V. show. Long live The Simpsons.","10","6 July 2007"
"373","This is absolutely pure genius of a show. I will never find a show this good. It was the most hilarious thing, especially the first 5 seasons, but though the newer season aren't as good, still a 10. Here are my judgments of the seasons:1-3: The best seasons of the Simpson's ever! Absolutely hilarious, I couldn't go 3 minutes without going hysterical. If you just started watching the show, watch the first season. 10/104-6: Hilarious seasons of the show. It is such a clever thing to see. Maybe not as good as the first 3 seasons, but still gold. 9/10.7-9: Great seasons of the show, absolutely awesome. Can't go one episode without getting a memorable quote (which earlier seasons had like 4 quotes an episode). 9/10.10-12: Very good seasons of the show, still hilarious. But, they did kinda change a lot of the story maybe adding a lot of drama for me. Still some great episodes from these few seasons. But can't beat the previous seasons. 8/10.13-15: Pretty good seasons of the show. Still with some laugh moments in a lot of the episodes, but not as much as you'll get from the previous. Some show changing moments, and colorful characters were added, but can't compete with others. mid 8/10.16-19: Good seasons of the show. Some good moments throughout some episodes. But I never seem to laugh as much as I used to. Some parts where you'd chuckle, but not as good. Though I give the show a 10, I am a little disappointed with these seasons. 7/10.As you could tell, older seasons are better.","10","31 August 2009"
"374","Let's face it, under the hand of Mike Scully as producer, the show really took a nose-dive right around season 7 after Mr. Burns got shot.  Despite the fact that the quality of the material was nothing compared to the best of seasons 4-6, the show managed to turn out a couple classic episodes and at least has one laugh-out-loud gag per show, even on the lamest of episodes.However, recently the show has improved quite a bit with Al Jean taking over where Scully was sorely lacking.  It seems that not only has the writing and timing improved in the current season, but the characters are acting a lot more ""Simpsony"".  There's a lot less of the goofy sensational stuff like Homer running off to a desert island or becoming a cannon freak, and a return to the subtle basics and nonstop clever comedy that made the Simpsons such an enduring (and endearing) enterprise.A lot of people are starting to wonder how much longer the show will last before they pull the plug.  My guess is whenever a major voice actor on the show dies, because the show has to be raking in tons of cash even a decade after it came into being and after numerous bad-episode fiasco's.  Let's face it, even a bad episode of The Simpsons is funnier than a usual episode of most other shows still on these days.",NA,"28 February 2002"
"375","If it weren't for ""Married<U+0085>With Children"" or ""Roseanne,"" shows about white-trash middle-class people struggling to live, than we wouldn't have ""The Simpsons"". The cartoon itself is phenomenal, dealing with everyday life than ever before.The family includes Homer Simpson who works at a nuclear power plant, loves to eat donuts, drink beer, hang out with buddies and get himself into goofy situations where audiences learn a lesson; Marge Simpson is the all-American woman with a big yarn of blue hair, who has two sisters that hate Homer, and loves the fact that no matter what, she'll always love him; Bart (everybody's favorite) is the oldest child who loves Krusty the Clown, violent things and loves getting into trouble. His best friend is Milhouse who is a dork, and a Nancy-boy that doesn't agree with Bart most of the Time. Yet, he's America's kick-ass son; Lisa is second child and the brightest in the family, who enjoys playing the saxophone, being a vegetarian, and dreams of going into a good college. She may not agree with her family, but she is there; and Maggie is the last child, the infant for many seasons on the show who never has spoken her first word, but just sucks on her pacifier.What makes the show interesting throughout the years is the interaction of these characters and the people that surround them; from Ned Flanders, the pious neighbor who is a geek to Homer and most of the town of Springfield, he's got some cool stuff, and yet Homer considers him his buddy. The other characters in the show involve Mr. Burns, the oldest living man in the town; Kent Brockman, a replica of Tom Brokaw, is the reporter who loves living the rich life.Though there are many characters in the show to list, what the show promises is making fun of everyday life from families, competition, politics, work; even the holiday episodes (which are a joy to watch) where a lesson may be learned. The Simpsons will always be there through years and generations to come.",NA,"13 March 2005"
"376","The Simpsons........ Ah, what to say about this show that hasn't already been said? It is the smartest, best written, and most fun series on television, and has been for more than a decade. The quality of the stories has dropped in recent seasons, as the show has pretty much covered every idea that it could. Still, it's one of the most entertaining shows on television.The Simspons look just like the average family, if their skin was yellow and they only had four fingers on each hand. Dad, Homer, is the chief provider and resident idiot. Homer is a man ruled by impulses. He swings from highs to lows, and back, in the blink of an eye. He is probably not the best person to be safety inspector at a nuclear power plant; but, then again, the rest of the plant isn't that far ahead of him.Marge is the glue that holds the family together. She truly loves Homer and the kids, even though she is constantly embarrassed by them. Still, she's not perfect: she has had problems with gambling and drinking, and usually dives right into the lunacy.Bart is the bad boy, Dennis The Menace taken to the Nth degree. Bart delights in pranks and mischief, but also shows great character at times. He has defeated Sideshow Bob at every turn, reunited Krusty with his estranged father, gotten Principal Skinner his job back, and stuck by his sister when it counted most.Lisa is the brains of the family, and the most positive character. She delights in knowledge and learning, but enjoys a good prank, or an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon. She has such wonderful hopes and dreams, that you hope she is never disillusioned. She delights in Bart's escapades, even though she often chastises him. Her intelligence often makes her an outcast in the community, yet she rarely seems bitter.Maggie is the cute little baby, expressing herself through gurgles, burps, and sucking noises. She is often the silent observer to the family hijinks, and sometimes their savior. Just keep her away from the baby with the one eyebrow and Mr Burns.A friend once described the three kids as the embodiment of Freud's id, ego and super-ego. I doubt this is intentional; but, those attributes do hold, when you examine Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Sounds like an interesting idea for a book.The cast is rounded by great supporting characters: Mr Burns, evil plant owner and resident fossil; Smithers, his sycophantic aid; Lenny and Carl, Homer's friends and co-workers; Barney, the recovering alcoholic; Moe, his enabler; Krusty the Klown and the former sidekick, Sideshow Bob; Apu of the Kwik E mart, Principal Skinner, Mrs Krabbaple, Comic Book Guy, Prof Frink, Chief Wiggum, Mayor Quimby, Dr Hibbert, Squeaky-voiced Teen, and so many, many more.The show has showcased some brilliant writing and animation, not to mention the amazing voice work. The cast and characters have grown over the years to become dear friends.Despite my love for the show, including the incessant need to quote lines and plots, I think it is about time to put it to rest. I still enjoy the show, but each new season seems less than the one before. It's time for our favorite family to move on. I will miss them when they go; but each new season will make me miss them less. All good things must come to an end. Still, I'll be there until the end.",NA,"12 January 2005"
"377","In 1977, Matt Groening appeared in the face of earth and made a comic called ""Life in Hell."" It's based on a true story about Matt moving to Los Angeles. It is a funny comic/serial and very animation. It's all about rabbits and humans and stuff. Then in 1985, Matt was hired by James to create a series of segments based on Life in Hell, But due to the loss of his rights, He went to a different direction and thus, The Simpsons were born! When the Simpsons premiered on the Tracey Ullman Show, The network executives and the viewers turned green from shock and American television burnt to the ground like MAGIC! *pig noises* Although It premiered its first and second series premieres, It broke the world record for longest running TV Show.

""The Simpsons"" is by far one of the greatest shows that has ever been on television. Few other shows actually are worth a bit of anything by the time they get syndicated, but ""The Simpsons"" just works and has from day one. The interwoven satire, sight gags, downright dumb humor, and heart ... it speaks to people in a way most other shows just can't. It has always had something to say. As long as there is human nature, then this show will work its magic.

There is such a wide array of lovable, funny, goofy characters, and a lifetime of memorable quotes and one liners. This show has hundreds of classic episodes that are just as good the seventh or eighth time as they were the first. I also can't imagine any other show that get so many huge celebrities to agree to parade themselves in such hilarious situations. This show has lasted longer than any other cartoon or sitcom quite simply because it's the best. I am proud to admit that I've been watching the show since I was eight and have seen each one of the 350+ episodes. I will undoubtedly watch the show until it's off the air and I will watch the reruns until the blood in my veins run cold","10","2 September 2005"
"382","I'd watched Simpsons back during the early 1990s when it first came out and was pleasantly surprised by all the film references and spoofs. But after Season 8 things changed, and I don't mean in the good way. Jokes were reused and some episodes didn't make sense. Even that pushed the limits. But if you're looking for a good season with lots of memorable episodes, my advice to you is to try Season 4. This had many good moments, including Marge as Blanche DuBois, a Krusty-themed summer camp, a heart-throb babysitter, a guest star-studded episode for Krusty, and Lisa's first word. I won't say too much for those of you who haven't seen Season 4, but that's where to look. For me, that season was the best. Everything else seemed OK but not as fun.","6","18 December 2017"

Another character I like is Bart because he does a lot of these funny things to either get attention or to get into trouble. I like all the characters and all the jokes because they are all hilarious and you can't stop laughing!

It's funny for both kids and adults alike and appeals to everyone, Matt Groening and co are geniuses, not forgetting the likes of Harry Shearer voicing I don't know how many characters!

"385","Ever since they started on The Tracey Ullman Show by cartoonist Matt Groening in 1987, The Simpsons have been a hit, but at one point of the series, I guess how to put it is that, the show stopped being funny. I use FXNOW to watch older episodes. Remember that one with Ringo Starr? OK, OK. Let's get to the point. I love the Simpsons, but it isn't what it used to be. Now it depends on jokes and pop-culture celebrities. I'm not saying it's horrible, bad, it just isn't that good anymore. It can be funny at times, but not what it was when it first started. One example is the Summer of 2014 where they said that a major character would be killed off. It was Krusty's father. (hollow cough).Thanks for reading! Chris Caracci","7","10 January 2015"
"386","In 1987, something revolutionary happened: A new kind of family was introduced, something we had never seen before. We got acquainted with a family that was extremely dysfunctional, but no less loving than the Drummonds, Douglasses or the Keatons. While those were entertaining to watch as well, it was important to highlight that not everyone has it quite as together in their life.Conflicts stir up, someone might feel neglected, you sometimes struggle even trying to get by. The Simpsons' money troubles remind me in a way of my own family. My mother could sometimes be poor and struggle with the economy, but always took care of us and gave me all the love I could possibly hope for. In short, whether you were a Bart, Lisa, Homer or Marge, there was something in at least one of them you could relate to. I was very compassionate towards animals and spoke out against meat consumption just like Lisa. At times I thought my dad was like Homer as well.And not just that, but many of the other characters were great as well. Some of my absolute favorites were Mr. Burns, Smithers (the two of which I've often imitated), Moe, Lenny, Dr. Hibbert, Apu, Hans Moleman, you name it. And the humor at its best was satirically profound, whimsically wacky and daring. There were few other shows like it.This was the case for the first ten seasons. The next four it got more cartoonish and less down-to-earth than before, but still managed to be a lot of fun. But as time went on, the show became less and less smart and more dumbed down in nature. It got especially bad once we got to the HD era.And in trying desperately to get with the times such as constantly referencing Apple products, making politically correct changes (Such as removing Apu, deleting one of their beloved classic episodes just because of a controversial guest star and recasting characters just because it's seen as ""wrong"" to voice a black character if you're white), it's become not only depressing to see the show go down further in quality, but to see its crew actively trying to tarnish its legacy. I worry that all the negative aspects of the later years will end up becoming so distracting I'll forget about all of the good memories it's given me.So in short, there are two different ideas of The Simpsons: A show that changed the TV landscape forever, and one that lost its own identity along the way and forgot what made it such a beloved series in the first place.In the end, the golden years are worth all the stars I can give it, and the worst years only 3/10. Maybe even 2/10.But due to my undying love for The Simpsons at its best, I can't bring myself to rate it any lower than 10/10 anyway. Take that for what you will.","10","27 September 2020"
"387","I kind of grew up with The Simpsons series, being THE series at that time. I hardly missed any series, I guess I've seen more than 150 and many of them twice or more. However i stopped watching the Simpsons at some point. At the point i noticed it became unoriginal and annoying, but more about that later in this review.What made The Simpsons so great, were its original and funny jokes, the interesting stories, the really great characters and all those allusions and mocks. And they always gave the viewer the feeling that this, although only being an animation, was somehow a bit real, authentic and comprehensible. Also the Tree House of Horror Trilogies made it even more interesting, making fun of popular horror films and at the same time staying true to the Simpsons universe. It was the perfect transformation of Simpsons characters into characters of Horror movies. I would give the first ~100-150 series 11/10 points for their funny original and sometimes touching stories which also had a lot of great social critique in them.However the later Simpsons series, especially the latest ones, show a great lack of its former originality (which is of course understandable after so much series) as well as bad and recurring jokes and what I would call ""a rape of characters"". The characters became dumb and somehow they became less distinct from each other, compared to how they were at the start. There are also less references and mocks of real persons and stuff. And overall they made the series a bit crazy and flipped out probably in order to try overcome the lack of new ideas. And additionally there is one thing many may not even have noticed, but I did and since i have noticed it i've not been able to watch those newer series: If you listen closely, you will notice a distinct sound of cricket chirping in the background in any outdoor scenes. It freaks me out because it's totally annoying due to the exact repetition of it and its absolute uselessness.All these things (that annoying sound only being a small part) forced me not to watch the series anymore. I think it's just a waste of time anymore and while I would give the first series a rating of 11/10, I would give the latest ones only 5/10.","8","6 January 2008"
"388","The Simpsons has been on Television for a Really Time. the Ordinary Family lives in Springfield USA. First aired in 1989. Still to this day questions me how great it once was Seasons 2-10. Golden Age of when it had such great moments and I know Simpsons fan prefer the old episodes. When It was being funny too!Still The Simpsons should have ended after the Movie in 2007. but overall I still love them!","10","4 November 2020"
"389","You know, I can tell you that the simpsons used to be a great show, but I'm pretty sure 95% of the people coming here already know that. It WAS funny, entertaining, satirical look at every day life. then they just stopped and brought in the insane plots. i mean bart befriends a western star? what the hell is up with that stupid crap? I wouldn't even mind the damn insanely stupid plot lines if you know it was actually funny? but no, it seems they forgot HOW TO WRITE JOKES. so in other words, watch the reruns but please for the love of the game don't watch any new episodes, maybe this show can die with a shred of dignity. now for my um... ratings. i'd give reruns (seasons 1-11) 8 stars. new episodes are worth a 3. making this show a 6. it may seem low, but thats because of the horrible new episodes. I guess that means this review is over. thank god/Jesus!",NA,"8 November 2004"
"390","'The Simpsons' was and still is my favorite TV Show of all time, that is if you forget about all the newer seasons. This show is easily one of the greatest things to have come out. The Simpsons has shaped the lives of generations of people and has revolutionalized the meaning of the word 'funny'. The characters in the Simpsons are some of the greatest and most easily relateable characters of all time. Everyone loves Homer and Bart, there's no doubt about that but there are so many others such as Ralph, Chief Wiggum, Moe, Carl and so many more characters that are also hilarious. The voice acting is brilliantly done and for the animations, they are brilliant and yes the animation of the first couple of seasons was great for its time and still is definitely watchable As for the plots in most episodes, it is absurdly entertaining. Since the Simpsons, many TV Shows are beginning to simply 'steal' their plots and just recycle them. The Simpsons, is HANDS DOWN, My favorite TV series and definitely one of the greatest classics of all time!","9","1 December 2012"
"391","Greatest animated show of all time. Maybe it's gone on too long but that doesnt take away from the greatness of this show. So many legendary episodes, awesome celebrity cameos back when they meant something. The money this show made on merchandise is most likely in the billions. This show will live on.","10","29 October 2019"
"392","It's the biggest cartoon series ever created. It's won numerous awards, including Emmys. It has continued to be popular after a 10-year running span. It rocks.But why? Well it was hard at the beginning not to laugh at Homer's laziness, Lisa's brainy babbling, Bart's pranks and Mr. Burns' 'excellent's, and now, it's totally addictive.Although, I must admit the 1998-99 season wasn't up to the normal Simpson's hilarity I'd come to expect, so I'm really glad that it's managed to pull in better stories and jokes.As well as one of the biggest shows, it also has one of the most merchandising campaigns for a TV show. 4 CD's, singles, toothpastes, t-shirts, Chess and Checkers sets - yep - the show really had thought of everything!While The Simpsons probably won't be as big as it once was, you can guarantee you'll find me watching all the new episodes, and the repeats, too.Even the Simpson-haters must admit that it's very popular. Or else, why would Mel Gibson, Christina Ricci, Winona Ryder, Glenn Close, Britney Spears, Joshua Jackson, George, Ringo and Paul, Drew Barrymore, Adam West and other celebs guest-star on it??And there's denying that 'The Simpsons' is totally unique - from the couch gags, everyone's quotes ('Doh', 'Excellent', 'Come again', 'Burp', 'Mmmm'), Bart's chalkboard expressions - this is one show that never needed to copy anything else!Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Harry Shearer, Hank Azaria, James L. Brooks, Sam Simon and Matt Groening - you've created one of the finest TV shows ever... thanks!",NA,"16 March 2001"
"393","It's funny still to this day and season 31 32 and 33 are getting better and the first 10 seasons are so great if I could I would rate it an 8173929126/10 I might just hack IMDb so I can do that.","10","26 October 2021"
"394","""The Simpsons"" promises to remain the most reliable half-hour of laughs on television. The emotional dynamic for ""Stark Raving Dad,"" echoes that of ""Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire"". David Mirkin's debut as show runner resulted in the first episode that gives him sole writing credit, ""Deep Space Homer"".""Treehouse of Horror XXXII"" delivers a decent number of laughs across its multiple shorts. The Simpsons continues its practice of PC superiority. How wrong can a once-great show be? Sunday's season curtain-raiser shows that ""The Simpsons"" hasn't lost any steam.","10","24 December 2021"
"395","Now I know if I put that it was only good up until season 10 why would I give it a 10 star? Well here's why just because the last 20 something seasons have been poorly written and almost cheap that shouldn't be able to take away from how good the first 9 seasons were. Hilarious, quick, well written and classic episodes up until season 10. So if your looking for an incredible, classic, funny and well done show just watch the first nine seasons of the Simpsons it's the same as just watching nine seasons of the office or Seinfeld. So anyway the show started out as one of the best shows of all time and I think that even though the last 20 years it hasn't done to great, the first 9 it did fantastic.","10","3 February 2021"
"396","I just can't say enough about ""The Simpsons,"" which I think is one of the funniest shows ever!  It gets better all the time, whether the comedy is witty or just plain knee-slapping, silly humor.  I never miss an episode, and neither should anyone else!",NA,"14 February 2002"
"397","I grew up with the Simpsons. I personally think that it is one of the best shows on television. Not only is it funny, but it also makes you think, bringing forward moral values combined with smart humor. Having said that, I think that the formula just isn't working the way it used to.I will always like the Simpsons, but I've noticed in recent years, that the episodes just seem to keep getting dumber and dumber. They aren't smart anymore and everything appears to be way too commercial. Its becoming obvious that no real thought is being put into any of the plots, the network is just interested in making money. Thats what it comes down to.The show is just not funny anymore, in fact, its annoying. Incredibly annoying. It seems as though no real thought is put into the storyline and things are awkwardly random and do not make any sense, despite the fact that it is a cartoon and is meant to be silly. But let me say this - compare the 2004 season to the 1994 season; you will see a major difference in storyline. Plotwise; smarter, funnier.But today; as I said, too commercial. I think it should wind down before it gets too stupid.",NA,"18 November 2005"
"398","There is so much to say about the Simpsons, and all of it good, that it would never fit here and would take forever to write.  Every show is a gem, with superb voice acting and animation. What makes The Simpsons so hilariously funny is that it can do certain things that cannot be done on regular TV shows.  The aspect of animation opens up so many doors not available to other shows.  And what is even better is that the show has never experienced a lull or decline in hilarity... in fact, it seems to be getting better.  I am confident that The Simpsons will continue to bring joy to so many people for a very long time.",NA,"12 March 1999"
"399","The Simpsons has to be the greatest show on earth. I started to watch the Simpsons when I was 10 years old and I continue to watch them today. Almost every episode is enjoyable to watch and gives you many good laughs. My favorite episode would have to be the one when they get the nanny ""Sherry Boppins"". The way they abused that nanny,who was just trying to help them, was great. Even the songs they sang on that episode were great. ( I brought a Simpsons CD that has the songs on it). Some of my other favorites include the episode when Bart sells his soul to Milhouse, the episode when Homer gains weight so he can work at home, the episode when Lisa takes dance lessons, and the episode when the Bart thinks Flanders killed his wife. However some of the newer episodes aren't as good. Some of the jokes and plots are dull. But they are still great to watch. I give the older episodes 10/10 stars and the newer episodes 8/10 stars.","10","28 July 2004"
"400","It's quite convenient to watch all of the recent seasons on a service made by Disney who bought Fox. I like Homer Simpson a LOT better than Peter Griffin, even though he strangles. I also like Bart's prank calls to Moe the bartender.","9","9 December 2019"
"401","The Simpsons is a great show. It is a cartoon but has the humor and characters even better than some sitcoms. It truly is a great show for everyone. Ever since it first aired I watched it and today I am still a fan. The characters and everything is so perfect, and how often can you say that about a tv show?",NA,"3 September 2000"
"402","Ahhh, the Simpson...First saw it at age 14 and at age 27 still the funniest thing on the TV in all these years. How come?Beats me. I guess the humor is so original and somehow an irony of a modern U.S. living. I watched every show about 10 times and still haven't get bored. Well, the most credit for that goes to Mr. Homer Simpsons, the best tv character ever. Maybe is my weird sense of humor, but i laughed (and laughed) at nearly all his jokes. Sure , we must not forget the others, the stupid cops (so real:))), currupted mayor, no brainer cops son Ralph (by my humble opinion the 2nd funniest character) and all the others who gives their soul to the heart of Springfield.Sure there are some parts I dislike, for instance ""the singing parts"" and some of the horror series, but hey you never can't win them all.
All I can say is for the end. I wish that they never stop making this great show, since it has put so many happy hours in my life. Hours full of laughing and just simply relaxing and enjoying the life itself. If I ever had the chance to see Matt Groening in person I will surely shake his hand and buy him a pine of Duff, for making my life happier.10 out of 10.","9","13 July 2003"
"403","""The Simpsons"" has made a huge impact on TV. It is the longest running cartoon ever in American history. Why is it so great? The answer is well a lot of answers. The characters were extremely likable, the jokes were funny, the voice acting was great, the animation was good, and the show overall is just fantastic. Many say it started going down hill after a while I say it is still going strong. The first thing to be said about the show is that I love the characters. There is Bart the 10 year old kid who always gets in trouble at school, Lisa the nice 8 year old kid who gets good grades, Marge the mom of the family, then of course Homer the lovable idiot. Then there are tons of minor characters. Seriously this show has the largest group of characters in one show I have ever seen. My favorite character though is Homer. The runners up are Bart and Lisa. Then we have great voice acting. The voice acting for the show was, and still is top notch stuff. Then there is the nice animation. Throughout the years the animation has gotten better for show although it has still kept a great style to it. Lets compare that to a bad cartoon like ""Johnny Test"". When they changed their animation they changed the style it had, and changed the show from OK to terrible. Then there is the shows great sense of humor. I have gotten a lot of really good laughs out of the show. Each episode is funny, and is really entertaining. ""The Simpsons"" has become an icon in animation that that even the makers of another one of my favorite shows ""South Park"" were inspired by. You can shove as much ""Family Guy"" as you want in my face, but there will be only one ""The Simpsons""","10","31 August 2010"
"404","This is one of my favorite shows.  In fact, if you ask me a bunch of trivia questions about the Simpsons, I can gurantee that I'll answer just about, maybe even all of them correctly. That is what happened in my exploring technology class when I was a sophomore in high school.  When I had mentioned something about the Simpsons, my whole class asked me one trivia question after another about the show and were quite amazed of how much I knew about it.  I have the book, The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family that I bought at a local bookstore.  It gives you info on every Simpsons episode from Season 1 to Season 8. This show is loads of fun for the whole family to watch.",NA,"21 October 1999"
"405","There is no other words for this magnificent show. Well, there is. Excellent, fantastic, satisfactory. And packs more. It still continues to amaze after 13 years. THIRTEEN WONDERFUL YEARS!Matt Groening, Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Hank Azaria, Yeardley Smith and heaps more talent-filled people some how can do packs of different voices of colouful characters as one of the funniest cartoons ever beats all of the so-called 'comedys' such as just shoot me and what about joan.Its lasted the test of time and deserves 100 emmys and more.

"406","The Simpsons is really OK for children 6 and up to watch. The Mayor really does look like JFK and I believe that he didn't do it. The show Homer and Apu has the song Who needs the quickie mart that my Daughter sings along with. Julia thinks that Apu has a humorous voice. If I said that I wouldn't appear politically correct or sensitive. Thank God for President Kennedys hard fought Freedom Of Speech in America. I sing I'm proud to be an American Brit where at least I know I'm free form the song God Bless the USA. Not to sound like the movie Oh God but I got the message: ""God IGA"". For those of you that do not know IGA is a grocery store. When God Apophis Creator of Humans tells you to buy nonperishable groceries its probably because nasty things that I did not approve as American Shadow Vice President are on their way like the superflu and microwave cell phone towers turned up so high that they cook people. Do not worry, extra food staying in your homes and surgical masks will protect you from all these things. Presidnet Jack Kennedy in his inaugural address said that on Earth Gods work must truly be our own. Remember that the safe zones handed down from God are Marthas Vineyard, Prince Edward Island and Guernsey, all of which are islands. The best of luck to everyone.

YEAH!",NA,"16 October 2003"
"408","This show (Even the modern seasons.) is entertaining and hilarious. I like the acting, the writing, the animation. I just like this show. But it's not quite as good as family guy. 9/10. Recommended. It's also clever and intelligent.","9","10 February 2021"
"409","I have moved twice in the past 2 years, and each time I moved I would check local listings to see what time each episode or episodes would be on. I have seen each episode a hundred times, and I still don't tire of it. I can tell which episode it is almost instantly after the couch scene. Yeah, I know, it's weird, but I have been watching it since I was a lad, so I've had lots of practice. People are now saying that the show is old, and warn. I disagree; the way I see it is it's trying to keep up with the times, and it's changing humor tends to make people lose interest. But not to me! I think the switch isn't better or worse, but equally good. I also think the way the use the show's repetitiveness as a joke. Many of you reading this will disagree, but I have been watching and laughing for nine years, and quite frankly I can't see the dullness and warn down side, but that's because I find humor to be humor, and if it's funny, I'll watch.  I apologies to anyone I am in-raging at this point, if there are any of you, but in my opinion, this show will be funny till the day it comes to an end. 10/10",NA,"14 July 2001"
"410","The colors fascinating the show are all my favorite bright yellow, bright yellow, emerald blue, simple and clever lines, but with delicate composition and omnipresent details, never rough. The titles of the two seasons are the same. If you look closely, you will find two differences: the easily recognizable one is that the bell rings after work, the whole family rushes home from all over, squeezes on the sofa to watch ""The Simpsons"" The posture of falling into the sofa is almost different; another thing that is not easy to recognize is that when Buzz was fined with chalk on the blackboard in the classroom after class, the camera quickly swept through, and the continuous writing of 20 lines of a sentence forever It's all different content-it can be seen that this child makes mistakes every day!
I saw that I was wrong when I saw the younger half. This drama is not to lie to tears, but it is not to deceive from the beginning like a Korean drama, or the audience is incompetent and the relationship is fragile. In general, this is not a drama with children as the main body, but it is for children who have grown up, and it reminds people of the funny things that they tricked their parents when they were children. Parents sometimes hate their knees. The child's heartless, sweet hatred. This family is lively and busy, not rich or elegant, let alone middle class, but everyone in the family loves each other, forgive each other and occasionally misunderstand each other, tolerate each other, despise money and occasionally lack money Realism can occasionally be a coincidence, but it has been quite difficult to please for twenty years. It also shows that what Chinese animation or Chinese film lacks is not a director, but a screenwriter.
An animated series that has been popular for 20 years, only the talents who draw it do not need to bear the ruthlessness of time, and they do not need to let the audience have regrets such as Harry Potter who grew up. The characters, scenes, and patterns in the play remain basically the same, only new stories continue to happen, or the current events are implied. In the United States, which is in a new position every day, this calm style gives people a sense of down-to-earth, like a box of toys hidden in the attic. It must have fascinated the countless American adults who watched it grow up, which is one reason for classics, no need for nostalgic classics.","10","21 April 2020"
"411","In its heyday The Simpsons was a joy to watch. The characters were likable and the stories were humorous and well written. I always looked forward to the next installment of this piece of cartoon genius. Notice how I'm using the past tense, this is because watching a more recent episode is nothing short of pure torture. The characters have become obnoxious and the same story of Homer getting some wacky new job is trotted out seemingly again and again. I won't pretend that I have seen all the episodes much past season 10 simply because I haven't. I prefer to keep my memories of a good show intact and not taint them with the wreck of a cartoon The Simpsons has become. I think it would be cruel to make my eyes watch anything from the 16th season whenever that may float across to merry old England. I can appreciate that after so long the stories are bound to dry up, but it's at that point that most sensible people would decide to stop flogging the poor dead horse and actually bury it. Years ago celebrities who appeared in the show actually played a character rather than just themselves. These people are actors, for goodness sake let them act!!! A series cannot go on forever and after 15 years I believe that The Simpsons should end next year. If the rumours of the 3 movies that the main actors are contracted to do actually happen then I seriously can't see them being any better that what we have to put up with at the moment. So I send out a plea to all the writers & overpaid actors on The Simpsons, tell Fox where they can put the show and help track down any episodes past season 10 and destroy them so that they may never be heard of or spoken of again.",NA,"27 December 2004"

"415","I was nine when this show first premiered and I watched every first and second season episode as they aired. After that, my schedule kept me from seeing as many episodes as I would have liked, but I think I've seen them all in reruns. In general, ""The Simpsons""'s run has been like this: the 1st season was decent family comedy and drama (a bit too much drama) and the Simpsons were kind of sappy (always down on their luck); Homer was the serious and silly lead, and Bart was a novelty item; best and funniest episode: ""Krusty Gets Framed."" In the 2nd season the laughs really poured in; the drama virtually disappeared; Homer became much stupider and funnier; Bart developed as a well-rounded, hilarious kid; every episode was great--some of them border on absolute genius, such as the one in which Bart is going to jump the Springfield gorge (I died when Homer rolled down the cliff TWICE). In the 2nd season the show really mixed its terrific humor with realistic issues fantastically, such as when Homer cheats on his insurance to buy the hair tonic. For the next six or seven years, the show had mostly brilliant, hilarious episodes mixed in with some good ones, and during these years the show solidified its reputation, becoming undeniably the funniest sitcom ever. However, in the last three seasons, bad episodes have started to pile up. Some great ones have surfaced, but the show has become increasingly unbalanced (however, almost every Halloween episode has had a solid amount of laughs). In this latest season, 2001-02, the show has really become crummy. There has been a string of unbearable episodes, and Homer has become too stupid, and Bart has not been himself. The plots have gone way too far. Unless the show returns to its simpler roots, it should be canceled after this season. It has given us so many greats moments, thanks to great writing, animation, and fantastic lead and supporting characters throughout Springfield. It would be a shame to just run the show into the ground and spoil its reputation. The show has to shape up or call it quits.",NA,"7 May 2002"
"416","The Simpson's changed TV for me forever. The amount of stuff they cram into each episode is mind-boggling, the writers must not sleep. Ever. I frequently have trouble remembering what happens in each episode because, beyond the fact that there are so many of them, the plot does tend to take sudden turns.The guest appearances are good, I appreciate the care with which this honor is bestowed - you won't find any duds in this group. However, the show itself is what I tune in for - no guest yet has improved the quality of the show. That says something.The frequent homages are brilliantly executed, the actors are amazingly talented, the writers must live on another plane of existence to be so creative & funny so consistently. Or they're insane. Hey, I'm not complaining, whatever it is - I'll take it. This is one of my favorite TV shows.","10","19 June 2007"
"417","The Simpson's in its prime was the funniest show on TV, in my opinion better than friends or south park or Seinfeld or any other comedy show before or since. however the Simpson's is no longer at its best, it has become very poor imitation of its former self. At its peak between seasons 4 and 8 it was verging on genius, episodes like 'deep space homer' and 'who shot Mr burns' were laugh a minute. These kind of episodes are unfortunately no more. The more recent episodes which, i think are steadily getting worse, have lost all the wit and subtlety of the early episodes and replaced it with painfully bad satire, regurgitation of previous jokes and more and more crazy episode set ups that seem to only function as a source of cheap jokes. in short this once great show is dying a slow death and i haven't seen a new episode i've enjoyed for seven or eight years, if your want my advice don't even bother with any episode after the 10th season.","5","6 July 2005"

"419","THE SIMPSONS is one of those TV shows that seems to have popped up unexpectedly overnight. It debuted on the Tracey Ullman show back in 1987. Then, in 1989, their Christmas special ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire""(1989) made its TV debut, and was the first half-hour episode. Since then, they have gone on for ten years and counting, still on the FOX network. The guest stars, from Glenn Close to Rodney Dangerfield, and John Waters to Mel Brooks, are always an added treat. The songs by Alf Clausen are incredible. The soundtrack album is a real joy to listen to. At times, the show seems like a veritable musical, which make it all the more enjoyable. The main cast (Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith and Nancy Cartwright) are always impressive, not to mention the regular supporters (Harry Shearer, Marcia Wallace,Russi Taylor,Pamela Hayden, Maggie Roswell,and Hank Azaria) are always on hand to perform the roles of the famous side-characters. This is what makes the show so incredibly successful. The only time the show loses its magic is when it either becomes too preachy or too crude, which have popped up occasionally in the last ten years.",NA,"6 February 1999"

Imagine if you had created something that powerful and successfull.

All of my friends love it, and while its extremely popular among younger generations, I've had English teachers who say that everyone should watch it, while a columnist for the New York Observer called it the greatest television show of all time.  It is full of wonderful satire of modern life, as well as simple, silly, humor.  My favorite episodes are the Halloween specials.  Recently I have also enjoyed watching some of the older episodes and noticing things in them I didn't see when I was much younger.  When future historians talk about American culture and society in the 1990s(and beyond) they will refer to ""The Simpsons"".",NA,"10 April 2000"

Homer, Marge & Lisa are in the car and almost hit a statue of a deer, Homer lets out his patented ""D'ohh"", Lisa screams, ""A deer!"" and Marge finishes it off with, ""A female deer"". Too funny!

"423","There are a lot of metaphors and satires in it, religion, ecology, autocracy ... everything. How can such films be judged?

However, I prefer to treat it as a comedy for fun.","9","17 June 2020"

I think that they are near the 350 mark though they probably have even more. This family just reminds you of a everyday family yet every single episode has some sort of moral about it and is always very very funny. Anyone who doesn't like this is of their head and it is not just for children it is for adults to. Matt Groaning is a genius and has created the perfect funny yet sometimes stupid family.

"425","The Simpsons is the greatest TV show ever made. Since it aired on the Tracey Ullman show back in 1987 to the present day The Simpsons has always been fun to watch. It's been on for ten years and it's still going strong. Not a lot of TV shows have that kind of power to dominate prime-time for a decade.In this show, we join Homer(the bald, fat, father of the family who works at the nuclear power plant), Marge(the cheery mother of the family who holds the Simpson family together), Bart(the ten-year old son whose the trouble maker.), Lisa(the depressive, smart, middle child.) and Maggie(the pacifier-sucking baby who doesn't talk). This show also has great supporting characters, Mr. Burns, Grampa, Krusty, Milhouse, Flanders, Barney, Ralph Wiggum, Hans Moleman, and Cletus the Slack-jawed Yokel to name some of my favorites.In every episode, Matt Groening(the creator) gives you great laughs. This guy's a genius. If this isn't proof enough for you check out Futurama too. Every Sunday I watch these two shows and I'm never disappointed. But I think the Simpsons is the best one. If you've been on Mars or something for the past ten years and have not seen this show you need to see it. No doubts there. 11/10",NA,"17 July 2000"
"426","I don't care what anyone says, The Simpson's is and always will be the best television series in the world, Family Guy is the second. For sixteen years, The Simpson's has been clever enough to balance out sophisticated adult humour with family fun. Homer and Bart are fictions greatest creations, they are both cruel and kind, clever and dumb, Marge and Lisa provide the moral tone which keeps the show in check, while the supporting characters ranging from Apu to Chief Wiggum to Milhouse always have their moments.A number of people have been saying the Family Guy is better because it is wittier and more interesting but I don't think this is true at all. Whereas the Simpsons works for both adults and children alike, Family Guy is truly adult animation, in that it's humour is dark and satirical and covers issues that adults understand and enjoy and which go above children's heads.I think if the Simpson's did this, it just wouldn't be as much fun. I say long live The Simpson's and I hope that someone at Fox has the intellegence not to cancel this since they've got rid of everything else of any quality, notably Family Guy and the hugely underrated Futurama which I think has gone because there are not enough intellegent people in the world to understand its humour.",NA,"5 March 2004"

"429","The Simpsons is perhaps the most undeniably greatest TV show ever. It has broken more records than other shows. It's the longest running prime-time TV sitcom, the longest running animated show, the largest cast of characters on a series, and a complete staple of American television. I grew up on the Simpsons it started when I was 6, I'm 18 and it's still running, and still a damn good show, that is a feat all it's own. How many shows basically have a generation of people who have watched it?The Simpsons have evolved over the years: It's early days saw The Simpsons being the wholesome family sitcom tweaked, it had pretty crude animation, cute jokes, and a usually happy ending. The show then evolved into the sitcom chock full of a variety of different humor. The latest years of the show, take advantage of the fact that it is animation, and therefore boundary-less offering up more sight gags, slapstick, crazy stunts, and more far out plots.The show can make fun of anything, and pretty much already has. It's touched on racism, homosexuality, enviormental issues, and religion. The show is not afraid to get very un-PC and no one really complains when it does. The show is not even afraid to mock the fact that it has been on for 13 seasons and it's getting harder to think up plots.So even after this show ends, it will still be around, it will still spawn copy-cats, it will still be in the memories of a large amount of people. The proof: ""D'oh"" is officialy a word in the dictionary.",NA,"17 February 2002"
"430","Spoilers!Set in Springfield, USA, no doubt located somewhere between Hollywood and the beach, this aging cartoon takes its cue from the same old Honeymooner/Flinstone ethos of the 1950s, with a 1990s Hollywood leftist overlay, and a lead character based somewhat on Archie Bunker, or Curly of the Three Stooges. The politics of the Simpson's is often annoying and cumbersome. As the Flinstones was probably considered crude for its day, so this is a crude FOX presentation, but with some genuine humor appropriate to a cartoon, seen poorly imitated on other FOX live action shows pretending to be cartoons.As for the politics, they seem not to have ever met a Democrat they didn't like. The swindling, thuggish, Democrat mayor is a loving parody of a member of the Kennedy clan, who does business with the underworld and turns them in at just the opportune moment, and so on, while the swindling Republican Congressman is quickly 'stung' within hours by the FBI spurred by the able work of little Lisa and a host of government investigators (I-i-i  work for Uncle SAM!!). Sideshow Bob prances around as a tyrannical Republican when it's merely a case of party role reversal. Clinton's foibles are related as eccentricities at worst, as he courts Marge in person, while the only showing for Dick Nixon is as a member of hell's own jury trial, seated next to the person of Lizzy Borden. Carter is amiably portrayed, even though as 'Mr. Malaise' in one episode, while Gerry Ford stumbles. And Bush is the infuriated ex-CIA neighbor, in this Hollywood subdivision, when Homer, and particularly Bart, comes to call.That is, the location of the town is the great mystery, and joke of the show, as well. Somewhere near Chicago, and certainly in the midwest, they seem to suggest. But with its bustling port, international airport, teaching hospital, university (s?), big indoor shopping mall, huge museums, as well as of the Hollywood celebs near the lake (studios and Mel Gibson premiers, etc), and the rest, it most certainly is rather some generic suburb in and around Bel Air and Beverly Hills, with access to greater LA, which would further explain the cloying politics of the show, as well (if not, then we'll split the difference and call it Denver).It might also help explain that rather confused attitude of the writers with regard to religion (or even physical fitness), where the representatives of Christianity are insincere Protestants, or in the case of Ned and sons, 'emotionally disabled', the former winding up in a mental institution, and/or bankrupt, and/or homeless, the latter perpetually afraid of their own shadows and unable to relate to any of the other children. At worst, Ned is literally portrayed as the devil, himself, in a Halloween 'dream' episode. Yet the same are on occasion the beneficiaries of a 'rapture', or warm praise and the homage to It's A Wonderful Life, respected community volunteers, and so on. The writers can't seem to make up their minds.Homer, himself, is the star of the show. His supporting cast is brought forward on occasion, particularly Bart Simpson. But Homer's one size fits all character is the man. That is, as with all the characters, they have multiple personalities, as the town of Springfield itself is multiple towns depending on the episode. What seems more or less constant is that he is the angry 'white male', couch potato Archie Bunker, who on a politically correct show could never utter any racial epithets routinely hurled on the old Lear program (PC for its day, but never today). Like Archie, he is sometimes a good guy, given just the right situation - family man, brave, loyal and true, and willing to accept people once he gets to know them. But the typical Homer is the grossly obese and proud of it, bully, abusive neighbor, arrested adolescent as are his two 'Ph.d' plant buddies, Lenny and Carl, a petty thief and moonshiner, who is considered a loud moron by those who know him, a whining and selfish child by those closest to him, and a friend to others because he is no threat and/or is a source of revenue. He's essentially the vehicle for the self-loathing of the writers, themselves.The multiple personalities are demanded by a show which insists that a 'small town' with big city attractions should be peopled by 50 or so souls. When the mall opens, the mob on the hillside rushes in - the mob of just a few character you know. When the mob chases Homer in a Halloween zombie episode - same old crowd. At the farm of the 'Heaven's Gate' cult leader - same crowd. And so on. Not merely is Homer simultaneously a trucker and astronaut, heavyweight contender and all the rest, but so is the rest of the cast, in a way. It's as if once one enters into the inner circle, the secret society, as it were, all the other people . . . literally . . . disappear. Given the amibitious range of movie parodies and situations the writers wish to explore, the mock of the closed masonic societies, as it were, becomes unintentionally a mock of the very design of the Simpson's, itself. One could argue that cartoons, Peanuts for ex., are locked into a small world of established characters. True. But the Peanuts gang dreamed of the Red Baron. In the Simpson's, Homer would be the Red Baron. The humor can be lost when everything must be flat and literalist. It takes more than a village for that, and certainly more than just a few established characters.At its best, in whatever season, the humor was honest, it pointed out at least some hypocrisy, if not that of the writers' own crowd and causes, and the community and the family poked through as worth defending, on occasion. Marge and Homer always reconcile. Bart comes home. Lisa learns to appreciate family, despite her forever failing precociousness. The cynical Moe - ya, drunks! - is somehow still a friend - and fight manager. The whole community wants the old 'Skinner' back, just so the relationships won't be upset. The real Skinner is unceremoniously tied to a train and shipped out, same for the mock Eliot Ness who gets heaved a ways away, while the delightfully gangsterish and crooked mayor is always welcomed back, as Homer finds his place is not to outdo civil bureaucrats who run the garbage collection. The small group knows its place and keeps its place once the next grand adventure is over. And they fight for that safe consistency, those careful suburban assignments, even, in this supposedly 'edgey' cartoon sitcom. On the other hand, and as suggested above, maybe The Simpsons is just a funny cartoon about a particularly wacky . . . cult.",NA,"22 January 2001"

"432","The Simpsons is funny as hell. I've been watching the show since its debut over 11 years ago, and it's hard to believe that it's still on the air. There are generally a lot of TV shows that I actually end up liking more with time, and The Simpsons has been no exception.In addition, I can do impressions of many characters from the show. They include: Moe, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Mr. Burns, Chief Wiggum, Otto, Hans Moleman, and Comic Book Guy. However, I usually have a hard time imitating the voices of the Simpsons themselves (though I can sometimes do Homer's giggle).Although, I knew that The Simpsons would eventually become a long-running hit series, I didn't really expect it to be on for as long as it has been. In fact, I kind of thought that the series would end by the late '90s (perhaps at the end of season 8 or 9). But I know that one thing is for sure: Every TV show comes to an end. And whether we like it or not, the time will come when The Simpsons will end.

"433","To say this is one of the best shows ever is an understatement, but what can I say that hasn't already been said?To me The Simpsons is a great commentary on modern life.

But one can't stop at one you have to get another, and another...""Work - ""When you don't like your job you don't complain you just do it really half-assed it's the American way""Absolutely brilliant television it's been a privilege to be able to watch it.","10","25 May 2002"

Especially that episode with Frank Grimes (If you saw this episode, you know what I'm talking about). He had to work hard for everything he ever got ( unlike Homer Simpson). When he comes to the plant and meets Homer and his friends, the result is hilarious. One of the things that really makes it funny is the last words he says before he dies are ""Homer Simpson"".

The loving family is Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart, and Maggie go though life in these little thirty - minute episodes. The television series is made by religious people so remember every episode has a life lesson coming out of the gospel.

"442","'The Simpsons' is easily the best show on TV. No other program is able so deftly to cut across age boundaries and offer every viewer, from my elementary school age brother to my university professors, a thoroughly enjoyable half hour of television. All of the elements seem to gel perfectly - the brilliant songs, the clever dialogue, the slick animation and, best of all, the voices of incredibly versatile actors like Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria who each play up to twenty distinct characters.Matt Groening and his self-confessed team of 'Harvard-geek' writers are to be commended for tackling topics such as relationships, religion, prejudice, immigration, class issues and American cultural hegemony with a sharply satirical but never blunt or unsubtle hand.And the viewer is often rewarded with a rich array of cinematic and literary references and the occasional surprise guest voice artist, as well as plenty of self-satire and meta-humour.I feel 'The Simpsons' will endure while other animated series of the 1990s will fall away. 'King of the Hill' dropped from sight, 'Ren & Stimpy' got boring and, unfortunately, 'South Park' which showed great early promise has fallen into the trap of profanity=laughs.If there is only one reason why Rupert Murdoch should not be banished to a cell for crimes against human consciousness, it is 'The Simpsons'.",NA,"30 October 1998"
"443","The Simpsons was a groundbreaking show.Married with Children was a groundbreaking show.They both defied how the typical American family is presented on TV. In many ways both shows presented the American family perhaps more accurately than any other. They skewered the traditional portrayal of the two successful working parents (The Cosby's)with two cars in the garage with an ""adorable"" small child and the happy household (Full House) where all of life's problems are solved in 25 minutes and everybody is happy.
But like anything that defies convention, they spurned countless inferior imposters (Unhappily Ever After, the Family Guy) and eventually redefined how sitcoms are presented. Notice how practically EVERY TV family these days is dysnfunctional? From Malcom in the Middle to Titus, the Brady Bunch era is well and truely dead. Even spoofing the perfect sitcom family has in itself become a cliche. So with nothing left to make fun of the shows are forced to become self-parodies. Married with Children reached it'z zenith when they added the much maligned ""adorable small child"" to the cast. It was perhaps the most blatant use of a laugh or sympathy track ever used on the show. ""Seven Wanker"" disappeared for good after only a few weeks but the show evolved into a cartoon. They pulled the plug in time. But barely...But the 13th season of the Simpsons is upon us. Now I would not disagree that the show is immensely popular despite the inferior writing as of late. But the plots seem to get more and more tired. The characters seem to become more, I don't know how else to put this, cartoonish. The plots become more outlandish. The charming thing about the Simpsons of old was the touch of reality that pervaded each episode. Now each episode revolves around a wacky caper. And Homer does something wacky. It's the same every single week. Remember that episode where Grandpa Simpson pulls up on a Harley out of nowhere and says ""I'm going to haul ass to Lolapalooza"" for the sake of being wild and wacky? They were spoofing shows that are ""wacky"" for the sake of being wacky. And they have sadly reached that point. Pull the plug...and let's cherish the memories.",NA,"29 September 2001"
"444","The Simpsons is my favorite television program of all time (And Frasier). The animated sitcom is witty, and incredibly brilliant. Sure, it is no longer in it's climax, but it is still the most entertaining program, made up of interesting and humorous storylines, clever jokes, some cool guest-stars (Although many of them are annoying, I enjoyed the guest-star appearances of Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce), and one of the best elements of all: parodies! If it weren't for the Simpsons spoofs on classic movies, I may not have been introduced to such marvelous films as Cape Fear, An Officer and a Gentleman, The Night of the Hunter, and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. So, yes, you people who dislike the show nowadays do make some good points, but I believe it is still a great animated sitcom, definately worth it's acclaim and glory.

Honestly it's just a bad animated sitcom like I mean yes it's very influential for the adult target ones we have nowadays which are way way better, but they all make The Simpsons look like a children's show. Especially when all of the humour in it feels forced and predictable.","1","20 March 2021"
"459","The Simpsons... Where do I begin? This crazy fun family is always full of surprises, changes, disappointments and more. Every actor fits perfectly in it's character. Every Character has there own story and personality. With around five hundred episodes today. Everyone is fantastic. The animation is incredible. There is absolutely NO reason to dislike this TV show. They have already created a Simpsons Movie which was also Absolutely Fantastic. The show makes you laugh, get angry and maybe even cry. The Music and sound are great and catchy and just encase you are wondering, the video games are not as good. Some including, The Simpsons Hit and Run are fun though. The Simpsons is GREAT. My favourite TV show, and I guarantee you will agree! Thanks, Hope you enjoyed!","10","11 February 2011"
"460","This show never gives you anything less than what you expect. It is filled with funny characters such as Homer Simpson, his boss Mr. Burns, and every so often a funny Sideshow Bob. The guest stars are even funny. If you haven't seen this show you should tune in, and I know that you'll be hooked.",NA,"29 April 2000"
"461","THE SIMPSONS is one of the funniest TV shows ever produced. Dismissive of the parameters of the filmed medium, the makers of this cartoon have allowed this series to lampoon modern life (particularly American) through a demonstrated capability to employ nearly all forms of humor: parody, slap-stick, wordplay, vaudeville, puns and given the variety of some plot scenarios, even surrealism.Some have even gone so far as to say that the Simpsons inform us as much about the human condition as Plato, Aristotle or Kant. Superficially, the show revolves around the high-jinks of a drunken father (Homer), his moralizing house-wife (Marge), their delinquent son (Bart), intellectually inquisitive daughter (Lisa), and perennial silent infant (Maggie). There is a large cast of ensemble characters satirizing just about possibly imaginable sociological form.The first few years were certainly quite Christian in content with Ten Commandment-type dilemmas posed and resolved usually quite haplessly by the Simpson family. The portrayal of life as a series of binary conventions lasted under make the third or fourth year when the show became openly and hilarious satirical. Here is where the show took off for the brilliance of the Simpsons lies in its openness to attack everyone: ordinary folk (the Simpsons), the two-sides to the well-respected Religious (the Flanders and Lovejoys), the corrupt and scheming politicians and company directors (Quimby, Burns), actors and entertainers (the Schwarzenegger analogue, McBain), and perverse and alarmist Newshound corporations (Kent Brockman) amongst many, many others.The Simpsons, while not consistently delivering the charm and irreverence of its mid-years, is still a wonderfully delightful show. Some have advanced that the tri-partite of The Simpsons, South Park, and Family Guy has offered an incisive critique of Western civilization without leaving any stone unturned. Whatever the reality, these and other imitators (even filmed media) owes a considerable debt to the trailblazing Simpsons.",NA,"5 April 2004"
"462","I can't believe I've never written about the Simpsons! There's too much to say about it, except that it's genius. Bart and Homer Simpson have become cultural icons for the 90's and beyond; as put by Matt Roush of TV Guide, it's a wonderful ""satire of the American and TV family (not always the same thing)."" If you don't like this show, then I quote Adam Carolla: ""how dare you; HOW DARE YOU!!!!!""",NA,"21 November 2000"

But thats just it good, in the past year or so i've realised how unfunny the Simpson's really is, cause recently I've got into 2 cartoons and watching these 2 cartoons make me realise that the Simpson's isn't really that funny, you get a few chuckles thats about it no side splitting stuff. The 2 cartoons I'm talking about are sponge bob square pants and Family Guy which is the funniest cartoon ever made, and cracks me up every time not like the Simpson's does, the Simpson's has never cracked me up, i get more laughs in 1 episode of family guy and sponge bob then i do in a whole 10 eps of the Simpson's. Its good and classic but its just not funny","2","17 July 2008"
"465","This show blows my mind, how it's been running this long and how smart its jokes are. And it is no where near as vulgar as Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy.The Simpsons' humour may not use bad language and strong sexual content, but it uses the moderated content to an advantage. There is barely any racism involved which is what I like to see in these shows, and has a great fanbase along with it. South Park is another show that relies on racism, vulgar and toilet humour to make it funny. And that kind of humour gets boring real quick! Why?! Because it is stupid and every comedy resorts to it these days.The Simpsons is a downright smart comedy, that is unique in every way and does not resort to adult content for humour!10/10","10","6 August 2013"

Well what can I say, i was hooked from the start and spent the next ten years eagerly awaiting each new installement with equal excitement. Unfortunately I feel time started to take it's tole and the plot lines became weaker, and more bizarre to try and combat this. They really should have thrown the towel in a long time ago and gone out with a bang. Then I would have happily given it a 10. All I can say is that I hope Family Guy, which is my new favourite (a hard thing to say at first, and a comment still scorned by many!), can manage to stay fresh and know when enough is enough.","9","18 May 2006"
"469","Brilliant television series that could probably be best described as ""The Flintstones"" gone stark-raving mad. ""The Simpsons"", everyone knows them. Some love the series and some could care less about it. Love it or hate it, it is near impossible to criticize the intelligence and creativity of this series. The titled animated family makes their home in Springfield, USA and gets into situations that are seemingly more outlandish and crazier than the previous adventure. Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are still going strong after nearly a dozen years of television life and with each passing moment it seems that the series sets some new precedent. For several years the show seemed to be the only attraction to the then obscure Fox Network. It was the first prime time animated show that was treated like a sitcom since ""The Flintstones"" quietly left the air in 1966. Many people feared the series when it first premiered in 1989 because they felt that it was hardcore adult material in a candied form that would appeal to younger audiences. Well for the most part this was true. However, ""The Simpsons"" would prove to be much more for all audiences. The great thing about the series is that it caters to all audiences. True there are usually situations that may not be suitable for all viewers, but then again that is true with everything on television this side of Disney Land and Sesame Street. ""The Simpsons"" works because of great comedy of course, but also great lessons that can be taken from most of the episodes. The people within the program may be animated, but they are just as complicated and vulnerable as the people watching them. All the regulars have their quirks, but in some episodes you can understand what certain characters are going through because the show is so life-like at times. Former President George Bush (the one from 1988-1992) once made a statement that families should be more like ""The Waltons"" and less like ""The Simpsons"". His opinion is somewhat old-fashioned and unrealistic. In other words, many topics dealt with in ""The Simpsons"" fit life for people in the 1990s and 2000s better than ""The Waltons"" did in the 1970s. A crowning achievement in television art. 5 stars out of 5.","10","25 March 2010"
"470","I'm only reviewing the first 10 seasons because those are the episodes I watched many times and I haven't really seen the newer episodes. The Simpsons is without a doubt one of the funniest shows I've ever seen. My favourite Simpson characters are Homer,Bart,Mr. Burns,Lionel Hutz,Ned Flanders,Ralph Wiggum,Chief Wiggum,Otto,Groundskeeper Willie,Principal Skinner,and Krusty The Clown,Barney,and Sideshow Mel.My favourite Simpson episodes are There's No Disgrace Like Home, Blood Feud,Bart Gets Hit By a Car,When Flanders Failed,Who Shot Mr. Burns parts 1 and 2,homer The Herectic,and many many more.If I'm having a bad day and I'm in need of a good laugh, I would put a Simpson DVD on my PS3 and start bursting out laughing. Thank you Simpsons for giving us years of laughter.","10","21 December 2013"
"471","""The Simpsons"" is definitely a great comedy show, but throughout each season, I began to see a change in quality. Every episode brought something different, that I was extremely glad to watch. Eventually, however, the show was not nearly as comedic. But still, I had a few laughs here and there. I have not yet seen all of the seasons, (which is a lot), so I don't want to be too picky and harsh. All in all, I would recommend watching this show to someone who would like a bit of a laugh.","8","31 May 2020"
"472","The Simpsons, Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and little Maggie. Just thinking about their names brings a smile to my face. For the past 16 years, this television show has been on the air, never losing momentum, and never ever getting old. It is rare for a television show to be so funny after so many episodes.This show premiered on Fox in 1989, and has not shown any signs of slowing down. In 1997, the show beat ""The Flintstones"" as the longest running prime time cartoon. It is the longest running television series behind ""Saturday Night Live"". No other television show in history has had the same number of guest stars as this show has had. From Aerosmith, to George Harrison, to Kelsey Grammar, the list is indeed impressive. No other television show has had so many characters. From the main family, to Barney the drunk, to Moe the bartender, all the way to the politically incorrect Apu, all are hilarious and bring true comic genius to the show.There are many classic episodes that still make me laugh. The episodes with Aerosmith and Spinal Tap are hilarious, as is the episode where Homer's car is found parked between the World Trade Center in New York City, to the family's travels to Toronto when Bart follows the love of his life, all are original and ingenious.Now, with the great medium that is DVD, we can enjoy this television series for years to come, uncut, and in their entirety. Many classic episodes are now available to own, from the first season, up until the recent release of season five. I own all of these DVD's, and am looking forward to owning the whole series.The Simpson's are now in their record breaking 16th season. Here's hoping that they last for another sixteen (although it would prove costly for the DVD box sets).",NA,"28 December 2004"
"473","Yes, time has not been kind to The Simpsons- but back in the good ol' days, this was the finest TV show there ever was (except, perhaps, for Fawlty Towers).A diamond-sharp satire, The Simpsons was the defining document of modern life in the west. Paving the way for adult animation to come, each episode was made with the the precision of a Swiss army knife. Of course, some morons have looked past the intelligent satire found in the jokes and labeled the show ""dumb"". Their loss. The Simpsons will always be remembered by the many fortunate people who watched it religiously. That being said, the people it satirizes are usually too idiotic to realize they are being satirized.It is impossible to pick a favorite character, as the thousands of them were well-rounded, hilarious rays of sunshine who added the the show's brilliance.God Bless The Simpsons.",NA,"7 April 2006"
"474","This show is so funny. I laughed so hard when Homer was saying  ""D'Oh!"", he was also falling down inside the dark, and one episode when Bart was at Nelson's place, Homer was wondering were Bart is and Lisa said that he was in Milhouse's place. After that Homer was calling Milhouse like this ""Milllhouuuussse!!!!!!"" and he was asking if Bart is in his house but he is not. That was so funny. And also my favorite part when Bart was at the field trip at the police station, he was stacking the speakers by saying ""Testing!"" and glasses from buildings break by echoing the word. That was my favorite episode from the one I said last. This has been one of the best excuses of the show ever made. **** out of **** and 10 out of 10 stars.",NA,"20 November 2001"

"478","This is definitely one of the best TV comedies of all time.It works so well because it pokes fun at and satirizes everyone and everything (including itself--nothing is sacred) while at the same time maintaining a fondness and understanding for even the most ""despicable"" characters. The Simpsons is an ""Equal Opportunity Satire."" Every character in the show is flawed in major or minor ways (to great satirical and ironic effect) yet the characters come across as human, likeable, even lovable. The characters are likeable despite their flaws and if you don't recognize yourself, people around you, or society in the flaws of the Simpsons, then you have a hole in your soul and a lack of empathy.If you look at the user ratings for this show on GIST (at the time of this writing) 65% of users give this show a rating of 10 (the highest possible rating) and 20% of users give it a rating of 1 (the lowest rating).  85% of the ratings appear on the far extremes of the rating scale.  Why do people tend to either love this show or hate it?Having talked to a number of people who hate this show, I'll try to answer this question of why people hate it or ""don't get it.""1. Many people who hate this show have not watched so much as 2 full episodes or they have only seen isolated clips--they don't understand CONTEXT.  A lot of the people I know who claim to hate it really have never watched the show to judge for themselves but are bothered because of things they have heard ABOUT the show.  The usual thing I hear from people such as this are things like ""it glories in mediocrity"", ""it promotes adolescent rebellion"" or ""it mocks wholesome family values.""  While I can understand why people might get this impression of The Simpsons, it's clear that they don't understand the whole picture.  The negative elements are portrayed as satire, not as advocating Homer, Bart or Marge as serious role models.2. Do you understand and enjoy satire and irony?  If you don't understand these types of humor you will not appreciate The Simpsons.  If this is why you don't enjoy The Simpsons, however, this says more about yourself than it does about the show.3. Are you able to laugh at yourself, see the humor in everyday occurrences and take life with with a grain of salt?  Some people I know who don't like The Simpsons are unable to see the humor because they take everything a little too seriously.  Lighten up and enjoy life a little and maybe you'll ""get it.""  Once you begin to laugh at the ridiculous in everyday life, maybe you won't be so stressed either.4. You must be willing to pay attention to get the most out of The Simpsons. If you don't want to think or pay attention as you watch, you will not get about 75% of the jokes.  Even when you pay attention, you will not get all the jokes the first time around.  The broader your background, the more jokes you will get since the Simpsons is a very intelligent show.  You will find references to everything from pop culture to chaos theory; current events to astrophysics.5. Many people who dislike The Simpsons think it is a children's show because it is a cartoon and they treat it this way.  Children may enjoy parts of The Simpsons, but it is NOT a children's show.  Much of the Simpsons goes over the heads of children and even many adults.  Again, if you are not willing to pay attention, you will not get many of the jokes.",NA,"19 June 2001"

"486","This show is awesome! I love it. It birthed the whole genre of adult animation. All of the adult oriented animated shows are because of this one(even if this one is one of the tamer ones). I watch this show regularly and I still enjoy it(especially the older ones), I don't hate the new ones but the old ones are better. This show may be offensive to some but it's not as bad as Family Guy or South Park. If you haven't seen it, it is about a dysfunctional family living in a town called Springfield. The family consists of:Homer: The dim witted father who wants to do the right thing but his stupidity always gets him in trouble. Also is very immature. (He's my favourite character). Also he loves doughnuts.Marge: The mom who is the most level headed character on the show and sometimes gets overwhelmed by having to deal with 3(sometimes 4 if you count Homer) kids all day.Bart: The rebellious son who always gets in trouble at school, skateboards and pisses off his dad.Lisa: The smart daughter who honestly, is too smart for her family. She also likes to help anyone or anything by doing anything she can.Maggie: The baby in the family who has sometimes shown a evil or suspicious side.Overall this is a great show and I recommend it to anyone, although parents may want to watch it with a very young kid.","9","6 May 2021"
"487","Where do we begin with the Simpsons? Saying that it is one of the most influential American pop culture references in the nineties is not enough. This is the gold standard of comedies, the Henri Matisse of sitcoms.Recently, the producer of Home Improvement, when asked about his feelings on closing his show, said that he doesn't feel bad because the only show that could probably go on forever is the Simpsons. That says a lot. But as a loyal fanatic of the show, I will also be highly critical.The show's nine seasons can be divided into three parts. The first two seasons is characterized by crude drawing and it centers on the Simpson family. Homer is still the bumbling fool we love, but he is also a loving father. The episodes almost always have a happy ending.The next five seasons can very well be called the Golden Age of the Simpsons. Homer is by now a worthless lazy slob, Bart is even more of a brat. What's even better is the whole supporting cast is developed into full-blown characters that make the Simpsons so unique. Memorable, unforgettable characters such as Monty Burns, Moe Szizlak, Ned Flanders, Chief Wiggum, Jimbo Jones, I can go on and on. During these five seasons the Simpsons are at best a relentless, hard-hitting satire and at worst still better than any other sitcom. The last two seasons have been accompanied by a noticeable decline in the quality of writing. To comply with the audience's demand for more Homer (the most popular character) all episodes are centered around him. This naturally has led to a change in the basic premise of the show. Homer was funny because the only thing that interested him was beer and TV (just like any American father). Now we see him engaging in (gasp!) adventures. Furthermore, the settings are far more limited. In the past we had the delight of seeing Homer function at home, at the nuclear power plant, at Moe's etc. We saw Bart dealing with situations at school, at home, in his tree-house. Now the writers don't bother. Lastly, and most regrettably, the army of supporting characters has been degraded to a bunch of lifeless characers. Where are the relationships of Moe and Barney, Burns and Smithers, Milhouse and Lisa, Snake and Wiggum etc.? I have the feeling that the Golden Age is long in the past.Nevertheless, I'd like to thank all those who were involved with the Simpsons for the greatest moments in TV history. You have made me laugh and look at America in a whole different way.",NA,"23 June 1999"

In my TV viewing experience, nothing else comes close.No other television show in history, animated or not, has been able to perfectly balance scathing social commentary with outright hilarity. The Simpsons pokes fun at anything it can, and that is what makes it so perfect. It takes no sides. Everything and everyone is a target. How can anyone or any group have animosity towards this show?!? If you're being made fun of, chances are so are your enemies.Sure, the show probably has it's best days behind it.... but I'll take the 'average' Simpsons episode over the 'best' episode of almost any other series on television.",NA,"27 October 2000"

So much of Simpsons depends on sight gags, little details that creep into view suddenly and without warning, and so many of these are physically impossible in reality and dauntingly expensive as special effects, that only animation is a practical means of portraying it.I have never seen another show quite like the Simpsons.  I have never laughed as hard or long at anything else on TV.  It is inspired, silly and sophisticated at the same time.  There is nothing else like it.There is no need for me to describe the premise or characters to anyone. Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Mr. Burns, Smithers, Moe, Grampa Simpson, Dr. Nick, Barney...the list goes on and on.  These are names whom when you bring them up in conversation, everyone know exactly who you are talking about before you mention The Simpsons.  They have been indelibly imprinted on our minds as unforgettable characters.Springfield is like no town on earth.  No one knows what state it is in, and the show has toyed with that many times.  (In one episode, when Apu is learning geography from Homer, Homer points to the location of Springfield on a map.  Lisa tells him it isn't there, and her head strategically blocks our view of where she points.  Nice touch.) Its residents are both incredibly self-centered and vindictive while being charitable and neighborly.  No other nuclear power plant was ever run in the way the Springfield Nuclear Power plant is run, ruled over by the tyrannical Mr. Burns, whose toadying assistant, Smithers, hides his lifestyle even while harboring secret fantasies of his boss.  Homer snores while fires flare out of control and warning lights flash across his console.  Of course, he is the safety inspector.Some of my personal favorites for episodes would have to be ""22 Short Films About Springfield"", which spoofs ""22 Short Films About Glen Gould"" as Bart and Milhouse wonder about all the stories the people of Springfield could tell.  It manages to draw ideas from ""Pulp Fiction"", ""ER"", and 60's sitcom fare and many others and cram it into 23 short minutes.The show has suffered from the passing of Phil Hartman, whose characters provided some of its greatest laughs. The inept lawyer Lionel Hutz, whose smoking monkey giveaways failed to attract clients to his ""I Can't Believe it's a Law Firm"", and washed up Hollywood actor Troy McClure, whose many cameo appearances in such film's as ""The President's Brain is Missing"" and ""The Muppets Go Medieval"" will stay with me for a long time to come.Not every episode has been great, (the one marking the passing of Bleeding Gums Murphy was dismal) but its track record has been really good for a show that has been around as long as it has.  Many shows run out of steam and long outstay their welcome, but the Simpsons remains fresh and inspired.  I hope it will continue for many a year to come.",NA,"5 February 1999"
"499","The Simpsons is a very clever, and very funny show. It has something for everyone. Unlike similar clams about some TV shows, this one dose actualy have appeal to adults and children. 5 stars out of 5 (most of the time.)",NA,"15 September 2000"
"500","I like all of the cast Bart, Lisa, Homer, and everypne else on the show. The cast really shows that even the most dramatic situations can be extremely funny. My favorite line is Doh that Homer yells out a lot. Bart is funny at times but he can be a real dufus sometimes. Lisa is great at getting on Bart's nerves I laugh every time that happens. Marge is funny too everyonce and a while. I laugh every time I see her hair. The entire cast/characters are performed extremely well. Homer is my favorite character on The Simpsons. He portray's a well balanced type of funny man who eats a lot. He is so funny. Bart has one funny part when he gets mad it is my favorite. Can't remember which episode it is when he gets struck by lightning. but I liked that one. Good Show.","10","29 July 2007"
"501","There are so many things that are great about this long-running series, where to start....The characters. The amazing cast of characters in this show is truly outstanding. Ranging from pranksters to rambling old people to veterans who live with their mother to a sarcastic movie enthusiast running a comic book store to weak sinister Billionaires, all the characters are very interesting and weather their plots intertwine or they go on solo adventures, the result it always entertaining.The plots. This show consistently, throughout its entire run, has provided quality entertainment. The episodes themselves are very diverse, sometimes they deal with two characters trying to improve their relationships, while sometimes they chronicle grand adventures. Either way, it is very funny.The jokes. Many fans believe that the quality of the jokes has deteriorated over the years, but I disagree. They are always hilarious. The humor itself contains one-liners, slapstick, situational humor, ironic humor, and more.Overall, The Simpsons is an extremely funny and entertaining show with amazing characters and outstanding writers that has been consistent in quality throughout its entire run.","10","8 August 2020"
"502","""The Simpsons."" The mere thought of these words brings a smile to my face. This show, now in its 10th season, continues to be one of the freshest and funniest shows on tv. It has often been said the worst episode of ""The Simpsons"" is better than anything else on tv. And what makes the ""The Simpsons"" so special? The characters, of course, and how they react to each other. The situations they get into from real-life problems to wild, far out stuff that you can only do in the cartoon medium.IMDb is a wonderful thing and it gives us a place to find out about movies and tv shows we didn't know about before. If you didn't know about ""The Simpsons"" before, give them a half hour and they'll give you a lifetime of laughs.",NA,"17 December 1998"
"503","The Simpsons is so hillarious but it seems kids like it but grown ups dispise it. An unforgetable moment is when they play Scrabble in the episode ""Bart the Genius""
Bart: ""KWYJIBO"" I win I'll go to bed now.Homer: Wait a minute you little cheater. You're not leaving until you tell me what a Kwyjibo is.Bart: Kwyjibo a big dumb North American balding ape with no chin.Marge: And a short temperHomer: I'll show you a balding ape!Bart: Uh oh Kwyjibo on the loose.

"504","If someone, sometime, ask me to choose between every simpsons chapter or Citizen Kane (or Casablanca)i will choose The Simpsons. So, TS are not only the best TV show ever (and of course no one can compare this with South Park, or Family Guy)it's also the best art creation of this century. The reason why the simpsons are so popular (also around the world, i am writing this from Argentina)is that is the excellent way to discuss human things, in a funny way, and also not showing the responsible. 16 years after his creation, some fans aren't happy with new episodes, and this is because the show is loosing the ""human thing"" and becoming a more conventional cartoon, but we still have in our memory the old episodes Anyway, The Simpsons are the the best thing that the world have received from USA.","10","19 August 2005"

"506","The Simpsons is funny. In four words. The Simpsons are relatively human, just like all of us, the total opposite of the previous longest show, Ozzie and Harriet, the ""perfect"" family.

"507","The first 4 or 5 seasons of The Simpsons were undeniably brilliant, start to finish. Episodes like ""Patty Wants a Baby"" or ""Oh! Streetcar!"" are prime examples of the perfect half-hour of comedy: the lines are dead-on perfect, and no opportunities for humor are wasted.After a few years, though, most of the talented creative team that made the Simpsons what it was left, going on to do The Critic and King of the Hill. What we're left with now is an ever-widening pool of recent Harvard grads who think that because they did an article or two for the Lampoon, they can write a silly little cartoon.  They can't.How much longer are we going to endure the smarmy, subtle-as-a-nuclear-bomb humor? The way sly satire gave way to broad, obvious parody? The endless recycling of old plots (""Let's do a Planet of the Apes musical! Let's send the Simpsons to a foreign country!"")? The smug, obnoxious Harvard in-jokes, such as their feeble little jabs against Yale grads? The way Lisa is made little more than a mouthpiece for every ill-thought-out, politically-correct ideal espoused by the writers?Watch the ""Australia"", ""George Bush"", or ""Lisa Becomes a Vegetarian"" episodes, then compare them to ANYTHING from the first few years, and see if you don't agree.",NA,"30 May 1999"
"508","I've been hearing it again and again, but I can't fathom it in the slightest...Why do people hate the newer seasons?I think the show hit its stride with the 3rd season and hasn't tired down yet.I guess that the humor has gotten too dark and strange for the mainstream crowd. They can have their bland ""Friends"" and ""King of the Hills."" I'm still sticking with ""The Simpsons.""",NA,"12 October 2002"
"509","I grew up with The Simpsons. I can even remember the very first time I saw it, I was 6. Ever since then, it was entrenched in my mind, and as time went on I got to experience the town of Springfield, its lovely characters and their behaviour.As I grew older (10-11), I developed an obsession with the series, which subsided soon, but years later re-emerged. There is just something about the town of Springfield and its inhabitants I love, and I can't put my finger on it.Contrary to popular beliefs, I always liked virtually all episodes from the series (with a few notable exceptions like the singing episodes or the ones with worst celebrity cameos ever), even from the new seasons. I've had plenty of laughing with the show and yes, even in the new seasons.Many people like to hate on the show for what it has become, but I like to focus on how long it has remained funny and relevant (to a point). I mean, the writers have to come up with 20+ plots a year for each new season, how crazy is that!But that is also the Achilles' heel of the series. When you have a lot of ideas with a lot of incredibly talented people (as was the case in the series' inception on TV), 20+ episodes for a season was fine, but as people left, and the quota remained, with the ideas running out, things were to bound to go wrong, weren't they?All the while the solution could have been so simple - fewer episodes per season! South Park did that, and it worked fine. So why not The Simpsons? Unfortunately, I think the answer to that is, because money talks. The show still pulls numbers and ultimately, that's all the executives care about.And I hate that. Even new episodes from new seasons sometimes have a great potential, but that is always annihilated by the deadline and the quotas. I sincerely believe the series could have lasted to this day not as a shell of its former self, but a cutting-edge series which would stand the test of time.I think The Simpsons are too good for this world, actually. Because the world gets The Simpsons and what it does with it is milking it to death. However, in my heart, it shall always remain as the best animated sitcom with some of the best characters ever written (I'm not even talking about the main characters either.). Long live Springfield <3","10","17 May 2020"
"510","The Simpsons is the funniest show on television.  All the characters are great, especially Homer, who is the funniest man on television (even if he is a cartoon).

They said if you don't show up tomorrow don't bother showing up on Monday.Homer: Woo-hoo! Four-day weekend!it made me laugh so much more when it came when u least exspected it to but now everytime he speaks its gotta be a line like this but not as good so i dont laugh as much its lazy comedy and lazy writing put some effort into it i say dont be so lazy work hard on lines so that when they come they are unexspected this is what the simpsons has lost in the past few years today seems to be all about getin all the characters in one episodei mean its horrible to watch when say 'mo' just pops up in a scene at the family home he just walks into the room with no explanation why he was there just to fil one of these stupid lazy jokes the writers put inhows about workin hard on a scene makes me cringe everytime someone just pops up like that annoying business woman who pops up out of nowhere yet again to fill a lazy joke spoils the show for me i cant bare to watch any new episodes the days of episodes like bart jumping over spring field canyonor my fave the one with the comic book bart millhouse and martin buy the comic book that is a classic no lazy writing in that at alltodays episodes come and go they dont leave memories in me make me want to forget them as quickly as possible give me characters i can relate to again and cut the lazy writing outand give them proper lines that arnt always funny make them be ppl again not joke toilets everything they speak is a joke its just awful and cut out the sitcom music between scenes all the new episodes need now to kill it off is canned laughter its not far from it",NA,"25 November 2002"
"512","It's been 10 years already and The Simpsons is still the best animated comedy on TV. King of the Hill, Beavis and Butthead and South Park are good, but can't compete with a pioneer.Homer is definitely my favorite character and the funniest one. I love the way he's silly. Lisa is the second best of the show. Way too advanced for an 8 year old. Bart and Marge are both too annoying for my taste.Every other character from Springfield are excellent, especially Moe and Principal Skinner (I love the part where he says: ""Yes mother"").Every episode has been excellent. Especially ""Who shot Mr. Burns?"". Homer is a symbol for FOX. Definitely Matt Groening's masterpiece.I was 9 when I first saw the Simpsons. Now, nearly a decade later, I keep watching it. The last 2 seasons were way better than some previous years. It recaptured the purpose of The Simpsons as a cartoon comedy about people. The 98-99 season rocks! I think this is the only cartoon that ever lasted this long. I don't expect it to be canceled any time soon.WAY TO GO FOX!!!",NA,"28 May 1999"
"513","I makes my soft fragile body cry tears of happiness every time I see Homer's big jiggly belly jiggle onscreen in this epic TV series, there's nothing I could be more happy about than to be Homer's daughter and like Lisa get to sit on his stomach all the time! Marge sets a motherly role for all of us white working class Females and I couldn't be more pleased with her affection and love for her children, Marge and really the entire Simpsons family have been setting the perfect role models for a Western family for over 30 years, the results have been tremendously great.Alcoholism is up, kids doing risky fun things has increased and mother's letting their children hide in their large hair has also increased thanks to this wonderful TV series, thanks so much Matt Groening, you've really made an English woman like myself so overjoyed with The Simpsons.","10","28 April 2020"
"514","This is my favorite TV show. It is so funny how they don't kill each other. Homer is the best character. He is stupid and does funny things. It's funny the way he raises his kids. Bart is the second best because he is a trouble maker and acts a lot like Homer. The best one that is based on him and and Homer is ""Bart the Dare Devil"". The best part is where Homer jumps the gorge and falls in! Trust me, never miss an episode on this crazy family.",NA,"22 February 2003"
"515","I'll start of by saying; If this was a review of the first ten seasons of this show, it would be a ten out of ten, no questions asked. But if I were to review from the year 2000 to right now, it would be a 1, so for those of you out there who are terrible at math, like I am, that evens out to a 5. Now on with the review.This show used to be hilarious, it was the greatest show on television hands down. There were (and still are technically) memorable characters, and used to memorable plots. In the 90s, everyone watched this show, if you went up to a random stranger and asked what episode a certain line was from, you'd get a correct response. The episodes weren't just hilarious, they were smart, had a moral to each story, and had a solid plot that the jokes contributed to. There were just enough characters in the series that you knew all of them, and at least one joke they contributed, and the guest stars all had a reason to be on the show. It was damn close to being a perfect show.Now, with the dawn of the new century, this show has slowly been dying. The characters and plots became more and more stupid and unrealistic, and just not funny. Some characters changed completely, like Mr. Burns for example. In the classic episodes he was a heartless, rich, greedy, bitter old man who would let nothing stop him from reaching his own gain. I had the misfortune of seeing a new episode just last week, and Mr. Burns let people who stole from him go for no reason, I honestly can't remember the reason, but it was along the lines of the thieves apologizing or something. Not Mr. Burns-like at all. And then there's Homer....what to say about Homer. He has always been slow, but now he is just outright stupid. I realize he has a crayon stuck in his brain, but he makes Peter Griffin seem like a genius, it's like the two are actually competing. Don't take me for a Family Guy lover either, I hate the show.The Simpsons is dead. It lived for about 11 years, but is gone now. We have the memories, but that's it-nothing else. Though, they are terrific memories.","5","24 February 2009"
"516","This show is amazing. I could say nothing else and there would be no flaw in anything I said. Everything about this show is really great. The ridiculous plot twists, the hilarious jokes, the awesome episodes, great characters, the little tid bits that make for great trivia, the family them self is awesome, I could go on. In my opinion the best episode was either the episode starring Rodney Dangerfield, or the Monorail one. A close second is New Kid on the Block, remember, the episode with Laura; Bart's crush. Where he has a dream of her literally breaking his heart. Those were the glory days. This show is awesome. Ten stars out of five. 'Nuff said.","10","7 October 2007"
"517","I have been watching ""The Simpsons"" since day one, and it really pains me to see the state it's in now. The last three or four seasons have been horrid. Not like ""I don't like this"" horrid, but some sort of ""intense raping"" horrid. The stories are awful, and the writers seem to know that, in the sarcastic way Homer says ""The Simpsons are going to..."" as if they are winking to their audience that know it's ridiculous. I think that Fox should find someone to take the show seriously, or at least breathe new life into it with Fresh ideas. The show is best when it's satirizing our everyday lives, but now it's just one wacky adventure after another.I remember how I wished Seinfeld stayed on for a few more seasons, but I guess going out on top is really the way to go.Do yourself a favor and try and find the Conan O'Brien episodes in syndication. Not that they ever show them, but once every few months they'll play one. How come out of almost 300 episodes they always play the same 50 in reruns??? It's crazy. If I see Bart steals a video game one more time, I'm going to hurt someone.Fox: you are ruining a once great show!!!!~~",NA,"24 June 2001"

This season contains episodes such as: ""Selma's Choice"", in which Aunt Selma thinks about getting pregnant. There's also ""Treehouse of Horror III"", ""Last Exit To Springfield"", and ""Krusty Gets Kancelled"". (That might have been season 3.) This was definitely entertaining, especially since I've been at home and only kiddie shows and soaps are on during the day. It's a must-have for any Simpsons fan.

It is still extremely fun to watch and they are not that bad at all. They are very entertaining. And oh, 'From now on I shall be known as Homer JAY Simpson!' While against any moral value, the Simpsons are still a way to get out of your own self and go into a cartoon world where nothing matters but the sake of these yellow humans.

"523","I don't even watch it anymore because, everytime I do, I make that noise. You know the one. The ""God, that's so stupid"" noise. It's sort of a sigh, but not quite. Matt Groening has nothing to do with this show anymore, which is probably the main factor. My brother just got me the DVD for season one and the commentary almost made me cry. There was a part where Homer was doing something loving and the creators say, ""Homer wouldn't be that good a parent on an episode now. His parenting skills are much lower than they were in the past."" Something like that. That's why your show sucks now. Homer used to be a complex character. That's what you strove for, realism through animation. Something touching like Marge choosing Homer over a bowling instructor, or Homer having to steal a tree for Christmas. They talked about wanting to keep the characters in some sort of economic weight, with problems to deal with. Now there's nothing of the sort. Everything is for the laugh, which really never happens. Quick, obvious jokes. Spongebob Square pants and the Simpsons share the same audience now. That's sad. What the show used to make fun of is now a reality. That episode a while back with the different spin-off parodies? Those were better plots than any of the ones used now. The show where Itchy and Scratchy make a movie, the jokes about commercialism and all that.. it's happening. And the plots aren't plots anymore. They've run out of ideas or the people that took over recently never had any ideas to begin with. They're all but giving Homer an imaginary green alien friend, or having Marge give birth again.

"524","What can I say?  It's the best!  The universal sitcom, one we all can watch, relate to, and of course, laugh at.  With so much great characters and lines, plus the fact it uses more plots and gags than so many other dopey sitcoms, I can't see anyone truly hating this show.  (Unless they're on weird medication).I was, I believe 6 when the Simpsons were on minute-long segments on ""Tracey Ullman"", but I was 8 when ""Simpsons Roasting on a Chestnut Fire"" debuted, all the way back in December 1989.  Homer's catch-phrase, ""D'oh!"" is now a dictionary term.  I've got SO many fave episodes, I can't place in any particular order.  I like ""Bart's Friend Falls in Love"", ""Stark Raving Dad"", ""Krusty gets Kancelled"", ""King-Size Homer"", ""Some Enchanted Evening"", ""Saturdays of Thunder"", ""Black Widower"", etc.  I like the show's first season through the eighth, along with some select episodes from the ninth season on.  (One expendable episode is ""Lisa the Simpson,"" which is aired in the same season as, and directly contradicts, ""Lisa's Sax"", the best episode of Season 9. It COMPLETELY ignores Homer's half-brother Herb Powell-and the concluding answer it provides is wrong.)  I do think the show was a bit stronger when it's primary focus was on Bart (he practically MADE the show!), the ""Homer gets a new job"" episodes can be a bit formulaic, though.  Let me tell you, I once read a Web-based ""Grudge Match"" where Bart Simpson was in the running to scare away babysitter Jan Brady.  His opponent?  Calvin, of Bill Watterson's ""Calvin and Hobbes"" comic strip.  The winner's prize?  The remaining ice cream, and control of the remote.  The loser receives?  Clean-up duty.  Very close results, but only one could win...and Bart took out Calvin.  That is DEFINITELY saying something.  I like a lot of the show's characters, Homer, Bart, Mr. Burns, the Comic Book Guy, Milhouse, Chief Wiggum and his family, Fat Tony, Krusty the Clown, Apu, Groundskeeper Willie, Barney, Moe, Martin, Lenny, Otto...all them and many more.  They need no introductions.  I'll watch it, long after ""Futurama"" is gone.  BTW: Someone said this show is now being surpassed by ""The Powerpuff Girls"" and ""South Park"".

"526","Ok. The Simpsons. It is a word that everyone knows. People always think of the Yellow-Skinned, Blue-Collar, Dysfunctional Family anytime someone named Homer, Marge(ry), Lisa, Bart(hallamew), Or Maggie (Margaret). The T.V. show's 1st Season was an entertaining little tidbit of cartoons. When they evolved a little, they became So funny, it was harder to find a Tap-Dancin' Sea Monkey than a Person who didn't Like the Show. I personally didn't find ANYONE who disliked the show in the Slightest (At the time I surveyed Hundreds of People in My Elementary School). Now, I am 16. The Year is 2002. The Simpsons used to be Fresh, Funny and Original. The Antics and Stupidity and the Sheer Thrill of a new 'Simpsons' episode(Somewhere along the line, we took out the ""The"" in the Title) which almost promised more laughs than an entire season of (*Enter Funny Comedy Show Here*). Most people liked and Disliked some seasons. They hated season 9 or 10, but loved season 1-8 and 11 and 12..for example. I, honestly loved them all, until Season 13. And, seriously folks, they were STILL producing Loads O' Laffs until Season 13. 13 is an Unlucky Number? Yep. You betcha. People labelled the Disease of ""Simpsonitis"" and anything that has gone bad in the past while (Since season 13 started) has been labbeled With ""Simpsonitis"". Look. Season 13 was BAD, BAD, BAD! But, I liked all other seasons. Season 14 has just started, and many doubt that the Simpsons will survive this one. I have viewed 3 of them episodes and here is my review. I saw the Halloween Episode XIII (Unlucky Numbuh 13!), The Rollin Stones Episode and Bart/Lisa go to Grade 3. I must say, The Simpsons Train has got back on track! It was chuggin' along right for a LONG time, Got de-railed for a Season (13) and then just went back on Track! Sure, they have the 'New Episode' Kinda feel, but they are FUNNY as HELL! I hadn't Laughed at the Simpsons like that since Season 7! People, judge it differently now. Season 14 has revived the Simpsons....Almost back to it's Prime. You know that all the Failing shows have recently been Diagnosed with ""Simpsonitis""? Well, the Original Host has just been cured...So, if the Original HOST got cured..Why can't some other good ones? Malcolm, King of the Hill, etc. Way to Go Simpsons! I know you've been readin' these and working hard to improve, and you MADE IT!! Kudos all 'round!",NA,"20 November 2002"
"527","The Simpsons was a very funny and clever show during its first few seasons on t.v. Sometime around the forth season, with the show entitled ""Gambling Comes To Springfield,"" (at least, I think that's the name of the episode) it started its inevitable decline. There had been a few duds before this, such as when Homer managed a country singer named Lorleen or that old sit-com stand by where Homer writes an angry letter to his boss and accidently mails it, but the gambling episode represented a turning point. Those other shows at least had some funny jokes in them even if the over all story was unsatisfying, but the gambling show was almost devoid of anything humorous. While the following seasons never sunk to that low, they never again achieved the splendor of the first few seasons. There are many signs when a sit-com runs out of steam and starts to show its desperation to seem fresh. Celebrities start making guest appearences playing themselves, certain characters from the show get married or have children or die off (think of I Love Lucy or The Flintstones). All of these things have happened on the Simpsons, plus they've gotten more maudlin as the years have gone by. Every episode ends with a hug or a lesson (remember when the show used to be considered controversial?). They don't have to worry about cancellation because they've been dead for years. And this walking corpse has outlived the shows that once outdid it, such as The Ren and Stimpy Show. It is still even nominated for Emmy Awards, despite the fact that The Powerpuff Girls and Southpark now surpass it. The Simpsons won't die, they'll just fade away.",NA,"31 August 2001"
"528","*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***The new episodes of The Simpsons aren't THAT BAD. The show wasn't #8 in ""T.V. Guide's Top 50 Greatest Shows of All Time"" for nothing! Yes, compared to all of the other hilarious episodes out their the new ones are just so - so, but they still make me laugh. Though, some of the stuff in the new episodes are pretty ridiculous (e.g. That screaming caterpillar - shudder ). My favorite episode is #72 (9F11): ""Selma's Choice"" & #106 (2F33): ""Another Simpsons Clip Show"" is the ""worst episode ever.""Here's what I have to say about the new episodes.The Couch Gags: They're still funnyThe Chalkboard Sayings: WHAT!!! They still have Chalkboard Sayings!!!! I haven't seen any from the 14th season. It must have been from all of those sports interruptions. Oh well, now that the Super Bowl is over, I should be seeing some new ones.Oh, and I have to say one more thing to COMPFUNK2 before I leave. It's about Maude Flanders. Call me crazy but she never really was that much of a character, she was just there. Hey, don't get wrong COMPFUNK2! I was just as shocked about it as the next fan. Her last big role (at least for her) was in #164 (4F08): ""The Twisted World of Marge Simpson."" She kind of went the way of Van Gogh.",NA,"7 February 2003"

"530","As many of the other people here have said, this show is still great after all these years. Everyone knows the characters and the ideas behind the show. I miss Phil Hartman and his voice. The character I'm most alike is the comic book guy, doesn't say a lot for me, does it? My Favorite Episode is the one where they add a character to Itchy and Scratchy. Then at the same time they add a character to the Simpsons family (Roy). That episode had the perfect satire. While King of the Hill got old in the first season, got sick of everyone swearing in South Park, got sick of Beavis and Butthead saying a bunch of worn out buzzwords, the Simpsons has progressed with time and have achieved what few cartoons can: Longevity. This past season has been somewhat of a disappointment in my book. It has seemed that there haven't been many good ones this season. I hope that next season the Simpsons will have some better episodes. The Simpsons still have years left to them. It could be a possibility they'll be around to entertain us for years with new episodes and reruns, which are always great to watch.",NA,"3 April 1999"
"531","The Simpsons began as an animated version of the stereotypical dysfunctional American family.  Lazy father, weary mother, troublesome son, prodigal daughter and of course, the baby.  Fortunately it has been allowed to develop into something more.  The show has expanded to include a whole community of characters.  No other show can claim to have as many characters developed than the Simpsons.  It is this that makes the show special.  That, and Homer.Homer is the star.  It's hard to argue this point.  Though the show originally had Bart at its centre, the writers found that they could only milk so much comedy from an 8 year old boy.  Homer was a much bigger cow to milk and so they grabbed his udder.  11 years later, it has yet to run dry.Homer started as the archetypical angry family man.  It is difficult to watch an early episode where Homer tries desperately to improve the family - this is more Marge's business.  Homer grew into the lovable goof that he is today.  He loves his family sure but he's not afraid to choke the boy if the does something wrong.  It is from Homer that the rest of the community has been developed.  Apu, whose role increases every season, has been allowed numerous conversations with Homer.  Mr Burns and Smithers, Lenny, Carl all work with Homer.  And Moe and Barney provide comic relief at Moe's Tavern, Homer's second home.The Simpsons is classic comedy.  Homer is the classic leading man.  He doesn't know that he's funny.  He doesn't want to be funny.  But he is; and so is the Simpsons.",NA,"29 December 2000"
"532","I have looked at some of the other comments and found one thing all have in common, it has at some point been the best show ever. Some then go on saying that it isn't what it was and others say that it still is the best, but hardly anyone claims it was a mistake to broadcast it.
For me it is one of the best shows ever, many shows come and go, ""Friends"" was a great show but now it is to much, ""Seinfield"" was great but sadly stopped, ""Frasier"" has been worse and better, ""Ed"" is a new aspiring show and ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" is also fairly new, but ""The Simpsons"" has been here as long as i remember. The first season was used to adapt the show from a small segment in a show to a hole series, and it surely is marked by this but it became better and is definetly my favourite show now.The orginality is lesser than the first seasons, but you can't grow tired of hearing Homer Jay Simpsons ""Do'h"".",NA,"18 April 2003"
"533","Everyone I talk to says The Simpsons aren't as good as they use to be. That could be true. But I think that it really depends on your sense of humor and your age. The Simpsons have become a show to appeal to the younger audience. While there are some people who have been watching since the Tracy Ullman days, the majority of their current audience is different from like 10 years ago or so. The current fans are probably kids between the ages of 10-18 years old, the adults that watch it now are probably between 19-28, or the people who used to watch them on the Tracy Ullman show. How much longer the show runs who knows?? They are signed for a few more years on Fox and don't be surprised if their contract gets extended along with Family Guy and American Dad. I am pretty much done. I just am looking forward to season 21 now.","8","14 June 2009"

Number one it has been on the air longer than any other cartoon show that has appeared on television and also the Simpsons hardly ever shows any repeats. You will see a hilarious new episode of the Simpsons almost every Sunday Night. The very first episode of the Simpsons aired on the Traci Ullman Show on Sunday April 19, 1987 at 8:30 PM ET and it is still showing today.

I have watched the Simpsons ever since it was introduced in 1989 and I never get tired of watching it. The show has attracted viewers of all ages anywhere from 10 years old to 80 years old. This is about the only TV show that I know of that people have never got tired of. However there is a down side to it, Like many other cartoon series The Simpsons are frozen in time, with Bart always in the 4th grade, Lisa alwaysin the 2nd grade and Maggie always remaining 1 year old and never talking. What I think would be an interesting change for the show is that if they would make some episodes showing Bart and Lisa a few years older and with Maggie at an age where she could talk. I think it would be an interesting change for the Simpsons and that some of the viewers would enjoy it. Never the less the show is great and I am almost positive that everyone has seen the Simpsons one time or another.",NA,"13 May 2004"
"537","this is the greatest show of all time the humor is great there is always something funny happing once the whole got sucked up in a black hole and another where everyone moves to another town and Springfield is built but I wonder are they still there or did they move back my favorite episode is where George bush moves in the house right in front of their house and start fighting and it ends in bush going away from the house and moving back to the white house and another episode I liked is the one where they build a train that goes around the town and the brakes get destroyed because it was built wrong and then the train could not stop and the train kept going around Springfield at 300 miles per hour","10","23 June 2014"
"538","I've never seen a show quite like ""The Simpsons"", and I doubt I ever will. The show has gone through quite a few changes over it's 11 year run.  Homer for example gradually gets dumber season after season (remember how he was in season 1?)  Parents no longer condemn the show as immoral, and horrible for kids to watch.  My mom used to forbid me to watch the show, now she watches it with me sometimes.I have to admit, I'm very shocked with how long this show has lasted.  I knew it had been on the air for years, but when it's tenth year anniversary rolled around, I was stunned and at the same time very impressed.My favorite character without a doubt is Lisa.  She seems to be the one character with her head on straight, although it must make it hard for the writers to fit her into the plotline with an ensamble of off-the-wall characters.I really think this is a fantastic show, and after 11 years it's still my favorite.",NA,"15 August 2001"
"539","I am a huge fan of The Simpsons overall, for all sorts of reasons people have already cited here--great satire, pop culture references, clever writing, etc. But in the past few years, unfortunately, The Simpsons has revealed itself to be far past its prime. The (few) times that I have tuned in to see a new episode, I often found that it was full of gross-out jokes and lewd humor. Now, I am a fan of either if done well (i.e. South Park), but it seems that by incorporating these things The Simpsons writers have unfortunately jumped on a bandwagon on which they really don't belong. They also have started relying on highly unrealistic plots, and I know that it's a cartoon, but what made the past Simpsons episodes so charming, brilliant, and hilarious was that they were just like reality, except slightly skewed. Needless to say, the past few seasons have been painfully un-funny and I rarely tune in Sunday nights anymore.But thank goodness for our local Fox affiliate's nightly reruns! The episodes of seasons 3-10 are some of the funniest, most brilliant television I have ever seen, and no matter how many times I see them, they're still funny.

"542","I can't help but feel as if this show has become poorer and poorer as the years go by. What was once a brilliant TV show which I; along with many others grew up watching and indeed loving. The jokes were brilliant as were the 'couch gags'. Now I see the new series advertised and I can't help but feel a little bit disappointed. Am I the only one who feels as if this show's soul focus is now on getting from the start of the story to the end with very little effort put into to writing jokes and more in thinking of which star studded guest they bring on? Anyway; moving on, back in the mid to late 90's this show was brilliant. The jokes were much more thought out and you could tell that they were making a real effort. Every gag was laughable and the stories had the ability to become completely unpredictable. For a long while this was my favourite TV show and I would like to remember it in that way.To finish off I would like to ask Matt Groening (although I highly doubt he would ever see this) to retire this programme for good as you've missed the chance to leave us all begging for more and I'm sure you are putting the effort in just after 20 plus seasons I can imagine it being really quite difficult.In case any of you are wondering why I have still given this show a 9/10 after slanting it, it's because of what this programme once was and due to all the memories it once used to bring to so many who are now in their mid to late 20's and so I would like to thank you for that.","9","11 September 2013"
"543","""The Simpsons"" is without a doubt the best show on television. No show has ever made me laugh so hard and so loud. This show has continually improved throughout its ten year run. The show's strengths are its unforgettable characters, hilarious and intelligent dialogue, and brilliant satiric moments. My favorite characters are Homer, Bart, Krusty, Mr. Burns, and Principal Skinner.People who have called the show stupid and immature simply don't understand the show. ""The Simpsons"" is a show for intelligent people. This show is a wonderful satire of our society. It takes every fault of our society and places them in the town of Springfield. This is where the show is at its best. I particularly love ""The Simpsons"" very accurate representation of the educational system.The only thing that has ever bothered about the show is its contradictions. For example, last year in a very funny episode it is revealed that Principal Skinner is a fraud, he is actually Armin Tamzerrean. This episode contradicts everything we have learned to that point about Skinner. Of course this being a cartoon, the show's contradictions are not surprising. However this apparent flaw is funny because the show seems to know of this flaw and continually makes light of this fact. ""The Simpsons"" is most intelligent and funny show on television. I would give the show an A+.",NA,"18 March 1999"
"544","From Season Three to Season Twelve, The Simpsons was SO good it was frightening. So many great characters, stories, parodies, references, set-pieces, catchphrases. I will never, ever, ever get bored of this show. For about 200 episodes, it was sheer magic, it was perfection. It may not be as good as it used to be (other comments concerning the lack of character continuity over the last few years are sadly true)i think it was the episode where Bart looks after the birds nest when i realised that the magic had finally gone (still quite funny though), but when it was good, nothing could touch it. I mean it when i say that The Simpsons at its peak was and still is the funniest thing i have ever watched. My favourite episode: ""Last Exit to Springfield"", which is staggeringly clever, imaginative and downright hilarious. It's also completely crazy, with druggy visuals (the Lisa in the Sky with Diamonds trip), bizarre fantasy sequences (Burns and Smithers running the plant by themselves), monkeys writing novels, Homer thinking Mr. Burns is coming onto him, Fake Vomit Co., ""Where's my burrito?"" and the funniest McBain clip in the whole series.That episode is twenty or so minutes of genius. And that's just one episode! ""Flaming Moe's"", ""Stark raving dad"", ""Homer the Heretic"", there's three more masterpieces for you. There's about 196 others like those. All of them utterly fantastic. No other show has maintained a high standard so consistently for so long. It has no rivals.Easily the best comedy ever.",NA,"1 November 2002"
"545","If you were to look in a book under the term ""Perfection in the field of Excellence"" there would be a picture of the Simpson family. Maybe because the term itself stems from an episode of The Simpsons, but also because its perfect. Since December 1989 this hilarious family has been entertaining us, and while doing it, been treating many subjects. Everything from trivial day to day things to hard core political subjects. A list of wacky moments or moments where Homer have uttered the annoyed grunt known as ""D'oh"" would be never ending and so would a list over the many celebrities who have appeared in show. The series is the longest running cartoon to date containing over 400 episodes after its 19 seasons.

With his dimness comes some of the best lines of the show (See ""Quotes"").

"548","This show has the most incredible writers and the most incredible cast. I was shocked when I looked through a friend's book and realized that Dan Castalanetta did not just do Homer, but seven or eight other characters. Most actors/actresses performs multiple characters; it's amazing how talented they all are.Anyhow, as for the comedy, there is nothing like it.  I have still yet to see any movie or television show like the Simpsons.  It is incredibly original.  In my mind there have been two types of comedy used in films and sitcoms.  Intelligent comedy where you don't laugh hard, but chuckle at the scripts cleverness, and then there is hee-haw, down right pee-in-your pants humor.  The Simpsons is the only show that combines the two, has jokes which are clever and smart, but hysterical.When the Simpsons steal from movies, musicals, and other programs, they are not subtle about it, but this is what makes these spoofs so humorous.  And as they steal from old movies and shows, this is where they hit an emotional note.  The episode with ""Sherry Bobbins,"" I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe.  However, at the same time I was reminded of all the times I watched, ""Mary Poppins"" as a kid and how much I loved that movie.  It was one of the few times television has really made me happy.  Homer's finish of ""Barney the Boozhound,"" with ""Not 'til you're fifteen,"" was so perfect it was frightening. What show has spoofed other sitcoms and films as perfectly as the Simpsons?However, remember the Simpsons do not spoof or copy anything.

"549","The show is awesome, what more can I say. If you want a show to watch regularly with the kids, this is it! Sine there is a minimum of 10 lines for submission I must add more. The show contains a plot that usually has a consistent beginning or end. Guest appearances are great and consist of a variety of well known names. The family seems to have a certain feel to it which we can relate to. You must watch it and over the years the show will have a place in your heart. I hope that the season will go on for another 25 years. It has been renewed under fox for the 26th season so that is a good sign. I did go out and order a few seasons of the Simpson's. They are shot in the full screen aspect ratio of 1:33:1 . The newer ones contain the widescreen format and are better suited to modern t.v. sets.","10","22 October 2013"

"554","What, in the World, happened to them? They passed from being a classic TV sitcom, to becoming a pathetic show, influenced by the fashion and becoming commercial. It's official; The Simpsons have lost their identity and become something made by some of those popular black comedy programs, such as South Park and Futurama. Trust me, I have nothing against South Park and Futurama, actually, I love them. But speaking about the Simpsons, we have to keep in mind that every character had its own way to show its defects; and to satirize the society as well, however, in the new seasons, they are just null of some sitcoms that we use to watch every day. I don't know how to say it, but Homer is cruel, selfish, insensible, and many others things that are just clichs; I missed the past Homer: drunk, jerk, ignorant, and fat. I admit it: All these things are still with Homer, but the way it's now, it sucks. I love Homer, and that won't die, but hate how the producers changed him. And Bart, before he was an original character that make mischief, bothers Lisa and Homer, and is bad in school; but now he just talk about delinquent, insensible, nasty with Milhouse (They aren't friends anymore, Milhouse is just a tool for Bart), and any other bad thing that you can figure out. And correct me if I'm wrong, but he hates Lisa to death, and so does Lisa to Bart; that's something normal in child brothers, but now this is a clich too. !Pathetic! However, one of the few things improved is Maggie, before, she didn't have any important role in the TV, she was just near to Marge, but now she has more relevance in the show, and it doesn't matter if the things she do are null, at least she is more significant. (Not saying that she used not to be, just that she needed more role) And I still think Lisa is cool. We maintain all the qualities she had, and improved for making her more psychological, and I have no problem on that, but her relation with Bart is not what it used to be. Nunca combine chicas!Any way, The Simpsons are now just commercial, and I hate that, just like the Academy Awards, that's why I ask Matt Groening: Stop that, return the Simpsons their originality, and don't change them anymore. The more they changed, the less fun and pathetic they are.Thanks for listen to me.Spoil Content: This is just an opinion, My opinion, perhaps it doesn't have any sense, so don't listen to me.

"555","From the time I was in first grade when I first fell love with the weirdly animated characters with yellow skin to today, I feel honored in sharing with millions of viewers worldwide the animated television dynasty known as ""The Simpsons."" I will always treasure the cerebral, whip-smart jokes, the skillfully designed story lines, the unforgettable, well-rounded characters, and most of all, the heart and warmth of the show that made me have no choice but to adopt the show as my second family.All of that has changed, nowadays. In its gut-wrenchingly asinine attempt to reinvent itself with pop-culture's love affair with vulgar, tasteless comedies like ""Family Guy"" and ""American Pie"", ""The Simpsons"" replaced witty, mature jokes that were well thought out with brain-numbing banality and misappropriated potty-humor that wouldn't even appeal to middle-schoolers. The only reason I even bother watching a show is that I hope to view a diamond in the rough, but to date my prospectings has not wielded even pyrite.  What really ticks me off are the neophyte critics who hails peaens for the show but refer to episodes in the earlier seasons as their favorites.  I'd gather them around and make them watch recent episodes like the one where Maude dies and her death is callously handled by the producers and hear how they think of their ""favorite show"" now.Don't get me wrong, The Simpson's is still one of the best shows that ever aired.  It is just in danger of being overtaken by the less-than-mediocre episodes of the recent seasons if the producers don't get their acts together. (**** out of four stars for first 7 seasons, * out of four stars for last four seasons)",NA,"4 October 2000"
"556","The Simpsons has had a mixed bag in its history. It has been the longest running prime time animated series of all time by now running for over 20 years. The family and perhaps the cartoon itself was conceived in 1987 though existed as Tracy Ullman shorts for a couple of years until having its own television series in Christmas 1989 and to this day still running. Unfortunately, the result of a long running creative work fed with ideas is running out of quality things for them and losing the original if superior workers as they move on. This has happened to The Simpsons and has been doing so for over a decade.The series has some decent moments every now and then but it is past its prime. When it was in its golden age, nothing could touch it. It had such good wit and humour that only a handful of other TV series could be on par. The Simpsons also facing increased competition later on from rival series like South Park, Family Guy etc , which then it was still going strong though not quite at the very peak.Skipping the 1987 Shorts, here is a timeline rating on the series quality in its years.1989-1992: Early yearsThe Simpsons prepared for its first television series. The season finale of the first season, Some Enchanted Evening, was the first episode made though it had production difficulties. Long story, it was delayed and the series intended debut in Autumn 1989 became Christmas 1989 with the first episode 'The Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire'. Season 1 and 2 were decent seasons though quite weak. The animation was crude but at least it was watchable. Homer sounded quite different as it took to the second season's finale Blood Feud to establish his trademark voice. The second season's humour and animation was better than the first though it wasn't quite in its best yet. Bart was the main character due to his popularity in the early years of the series dubbed 'Bartmania' though Homer would take his breakout place and have it since to this day.1992 - 1998 Golden ageThe third season was when The Simpsons really could get there. The series improved up to here in both quality and animation. With Season 4 possibly the best Simpsons season of all time. Subsequent seasons such as Season 5 and 6 were strong as well. The animation improves more and more though between Season 6 and 8 though humour was quite corny at times during these two seasons. Season 7 and 8 was also good though not quite the very best. Stories now expanded on even non Simpson characters. The Simpsons is in its prime during these seasons, having plenty of great and worth watching episodes.1998 - Present Declining yearsThe series during the ninth season seems to struggle here. There are some of the final genuinely good episodes in the season like The City of New York Vs. Homer Simpson but then are mixed with weaker ones like the controversial The Principal and the Pauper. By season 10, it is clearer that the series has passed its prime. There were still some decent episodes but it has lost quite a lot of its magic. The show runner then, Mike Scully, has been to blame. It is possible the series creator, Matt Groening and some other significant of The Simpsons left the series to work on another series which would be Futurama.Season 11 was possibly the weakest Simpsons season ever. Not to be biased but it had a good share of forgettable episodes and the series hadn't been the same then and still. Some standouts like Treehouse of Horror X and Behind the Laughter but these failed to have the season 'up there'.Season 12 had improved if not equal episodes like its predecessor. Still some forgettable episodes. Lots have said Season 13 was the worst Simpson's season ever. This may be so by some duller episodes and being still not on par to the series best years. Season 15 probably had the original staff who departed to work on Futurama back due to the series cancellation in August 2003 which the fifteenth season began in Late 2003. 2005 - Present Current statusThe series is still going weak and in 2005 was when the episodes were getting duller and duller as well as less funnier than ever. I stopped watching the series regularly in about season 18. I just lost interest in the declining quality.I can't sit through the episodes fully now. And if you're saying I have grown out of the series, no. Some scenes of the older episodes in the golden age still make me laugh. Everyone prefers the old Simpsons back then.The animation has improved progressively from season to season, being cleaner and all. The characters had large pupils sometimes in the fourth season, the character's skin looked slightly green from season 6 to 9. The character's eyes looked a little blue in some episodes produced in 2004. As well as the series beginning to use digital ink and colour beginning in season 14. Some also even criticize the technologically superior animation now compared to before, such as having the characters now inflexible than before.Overall, The Simpsons is a decent television series. It was born good, thrived greatly then descended poorly.Early years : 7/10Golden age : 9/10Declining years : 5/10","9","18 April 2010"
"557","The Simpsons is one of the most clever, funniest shows out there. Its about the life of a family consisting of a lazy, alcoholic father; a hard work, blue-haired mother; a devilish little boy; and a smart young girl. I find it funny how the same people can do so many different voices at once. For such a funny show I give it a 9/10.",NA,"26 January 2002"
"558","First of all let me tell you that I'm ""almost"" one of those die-hard fans that now everything about the simpson or have ""almost"" everything of the simpsons.I saw them for the first time when I was about 11 years old. That would make it 1992 or 93, which sounds about right.And like everyone else my age, we were immediately hooked! Favourite character will always be homer to me. The stuff he get's himself into is just too funny imo.But the greatest credit must go to the writers. The way they've kept the season fresh over the years and always tried to top themselves was amazing.But as I grew older, the series was getting weaker and so I watched the show fiercely up until season 14...maybe 15. But I must admit, from season 11 and upwards... the quality just went down a drain. No funny stories anymore, toilet humor, lame jokes... just nothing really.Then sporadicly I saw some new shows but didn't finish'em. Rather saw season 2-8 again and again and again, well you catch my drift.I think Season 14-17 was the bottom level of the show. After those they've gotten a little bit better with some refreshing stuff now and again. Recently I saw some season 20 and 21 episodes and sometimes, I actually laughed... who would've guessed? But they'll never reached the golden age anymore which was season 2 - 8.So part of me will always remember them as the greatest show there ever was, but they should've let it go by now imo...Best regards,Raf","10","6 July 2010"

"560","The Simpsons is the best show on TV because it's a great comedy that's suitable for all ages. Younger ones may not get certain adult-like jokes but the show never was unsuitable for them. The Simpsons pretty much-dominated as it lasted longer than the Flintstones and has some of the biggest celebrities around on the show. The characters are brilliant, there's not one annoying character you wish they get rid of. Homer Simpson is no doubt one of the funniest characters on TV and some great minor characters like Comic Book Guy, Moe, Chief Wiggum and the list goes on. The show maybe not what it used to be but it hasn't lost the love. May the Simpsons go on for ages.",NA,"27 April 2004"
"561","In my humble opinion,The Simpsons is the best animated series ever written.The Simpsons is the best situation comedy series ever written.The Simpsons is the show which has had the most cultural impact worldwide during the last two decades.The Simpsons is the only serial which has managed to remain of a consistently high quality for thirteen years and counting.The Simpsons is by far and away the best example of a sitcom which amuses, and appeals to, many different people on many different levels.The Simpsons has produced the highest number of beloved characters of any sitcom, extending way beyond those central to the show.The Simpsons is the best television show ever made.","10","11 April 2002"
"562","I think that ""the simpsons"" are the best show, better than any other, even if they are just cartoon, but when a was a child i didnt like them, but know, im 17 years old, and i always see the simpsons, they never bored me.. they are really great!!! They reflect all the humans stupidity, they are a satire of the humans life. Anyway, i think that if they have lasted all this years is for something: they are just the best!",NA,"30 December 2000"
"563","The fact that Americans criticize themselves is the main reason why The Simpsons appeals to me. In one episode for instance, when Homer and the family go to England, they talk to a hotel clerk and Homer wears a t-shirt of Americans being the rulers of the earth or something, and even saying something like ""other cultures love Americans"", it is funny because it shows us that there indeed are Americans who understand how ethnocentric they can be. Of course, I would be very racist to generalize like this and say that all Americans are like this. There are of course many Americans who know and are aware of the problem of ethnocentrism.",NA,"19 October 2005"
"564","Basically, for those who don't take your time to watch this awesome show, The Simpsons is set around the family of the same name who live in the fictional town of Springfield, USA. Unfortunately, they don't tell us which Springfield it is, since there are at least three that I know of. The Simpson family has 5 members: Homer (the father), Marge (the mother), Bart (the eldest child), Lisa (the eldest daughter), and Maggie (the youngest).Homer is a blue-collar worker who works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7G. He is bald, overweight, crude, usually thickheaded, a raging alcoholic, clumsy, and at most times very thoughtless. He has the most (mis)adventures out of everyone in the family and has had many occupations throughout the series. Homer, although he doesn't appear to be, is at times very athletic and smart. He may be very annoying with his antics in the show, but hey, you've got to love Homer. D'oh!Marjorie (aka Marge) is the mother of the family. She has blue hair in the shape of a very high beehive. She is very patient with many things, especially with her husband Homer's actions. Like many of the Simpson characters, Marge is a stereotypical character. She's mainly naive and gullible to many things. However, as calm as she normally is, she has broken down and has snapped sometimes. Marge has had a gambling problem, road rage, amnesia, and overdosed on steroids. She has fought with Homer, and sometimes even went almost as far as leaving him. However, through those good and bad times, she sticks with her man.The children: Bartholemew (Bart) is 10 years old, rebellious, mischievous, witty, an underachiever, and very street smart. Best known for his pranks, he has become notorious at Springfield Elementary School for ticking off the principal, Seymour Skinner. Although he struggles in school, it's only because he chooses not to pay attention, not because he's dumb. He has always had a bit of a sibling rivalry with his sister, Lisa. Although they fight a lot, they both care for each other very much. Lisa is 8 years old, very intelligent, and deeply values her integrity. She can be very rebellious at times, and has received detention as many times as Bart. Maggie is 2 years old, has barely ever spoken a word in the entire series, and is very influenced by other people's actions. She is surprisingly very skilled as a marksman, being able to shoot people non-fatally. She is good at going with the flow and is aware of her surroundings.The other characters that appear in the show are very unique and have very different personalities and make the show what it is. Overall, this is one of the best--if not the best--show ever.","10","25 April 2008"
"565","A brilliant social commentary, and a treasure-trove of inspired comedy, filled with quality jokes ranging from highfalutin' to salt-of-the-earth. With its rapid-fire dialogue (reminiscent of the Jay Ward cartoons), ""The Simpsons"" alternates between highbrow and lowbrow quicker than any show ever, and usually hits the comic bullseye doing so.  And despite prudish allegations of its immorality, it has proven itself to be a responsible and decent show.  It asserts that moral goodness can survive in a dysfunctional climate, and in doing so never loses its keen sense of irony.The voice actors are outstanding, the music is outstanding, the animation (since the relatively crude early episodes) is consistently fun to watch. It was certainly the best half-hour comedy of the '90s (sorry, ""Seinfeld"" and ""Frasier"" fans), and perhaps the best TV comedy show ever.  Long ago it eclipsed ""Bullwinkle"" and ""The Flintstones"" as TV's greatest animated show.There's really not much bad to say about ""The Simpsons"", except that it relies a bit too much on borrowing from movies and shows, and seems to be playing it more safe in recent seasons, too often settling for silly schtick that lacks the satiric bite of earlier episodes.  Also, while the animation remains good, the now-familiar Groening style has less of a whomp than it once did.",NA,"13 January 2000"
"566","I LOVE THE SIMPSONS! It is the greatest animated show of all time, which started so many others. I watched it when it premiered on aussie TV in 1990, and it was instantly a hit. Everyone was talking about it at school - I remember the day after the first episode aired (It was Bart The Genious), the teacher said to us the next morning ""Who watched The Simpsons last night?"". Everyone put their hands up - the room fell into an avalanche of conversation - ""we laughed at the bit when maggie was pushing all the buttons..."", ""we laughed at this, at that"". All this after the first episode! Everyone was after the short lived 'Simpsons Illustrated' magazine, and the classic 'The Simpsons sing the Blues' CD.The thing is, though, that the series did nothing but improve. Once Homer's voice changed (most fans can tell the season in which it did), the show was guaranteed of laughs. From the classic Blood Fued with Mr. Burns, Lurleen Lumpkin, to who shot Mr. Burns... can you remember the Bartman? The Network here in Australia which airs it used to screen it at 6pm each weeknight in competition with the 2 other networks which screened the news (Yep, there are only 3 commercial channels here in aus). Nowadays, repeats are screened on average of about 4 times a week at different times ranging from wednesday nights to sunday nights. You just never get sick of the Simpsons, and Homers halarious antics!But, I must now pose the question - you can get too much of a good thing, cant you? Lately, while the series has remained funny, the storylines are just getting a little too extreme, and, need I say it, Homer just a bit too stupid. I hate to say it, but Principal Skinner being an imposter to his mother was a lame storyline - and moving the whole town to another site after homer ruined the old one, awwwwww, I dunno about that. Yeah, its just supposed to be a funny show, but I feel the producers have put the family through a bit too much now. Forget Homer banging in on celebritys, destroying the whole town and getting into global situations (Like when Bart went to Australia) - it was better then the show concentrated on the small family problems, then it was funnier.The Simpsons are a great show, but it would of been greater if they would of ended production a few years ago, then it would of been a 'Great little show'. Now I feel its gone on a bit too long. But, nevertheless, i still LOVE THE SIMPSONS!!!!!",NA,"4 January 2001"
"567","TIME Magizine chose ""The Simpsons"" as the greatest show of the century in it's millenium edition.  Seeing as how television has only been around for 50 or 60 years, they, in actuality, named this show the best show ever made. How right they are.  This IS the best show ever put on television.  Not only does it teach valuabe lessons in almost every episode, it does so in an amusing and clever way that snares the audience and, in the end, they actually get something out of the show.  Not to many shows can do that. Here are some of the finer points of this show. 1)  Morals.  This show teaches some of the lessons of life.  I've heard parents say they don't want their kids to watch this because it is ""vulgar."" I would encourage my children to watch it, not only for the humor, but for the emotional content that they might not get out of other shows.  Sure, the morals are stuck right in your face, but they are underlying in the actions of the characters, which brings me to fine point number 2. 2)  Characters.  There are hundreds of them, each amusing in thier own way.  While the show mainly revolves around the Simpson family, other characters are brought into the spotlight in many, many episodes.  And they are funny.  Every character has it's own catch-phrase or specific characteristic. (Professor John Frink is my favorite.)     3)  Writing.  Some of the best on T.V.  Sight gags, puns, one-liners, and the plot situations are all very well-done.  I could watch an episode 3 or 4 times and still find something new in the backround, while still laughing at the jokes, which remain funny.  The only bad thing about this show is the first 3 seasons, which were still funny, but not as much.  The animation was also very amateur compared to recent seasons. I'm sure I could go on forever about this show.  It is the greatest, and it always will be.  It will be a sorry day when this goes off the air, but we loyal fans can be assured, they will never stop showing reruns.",NA,"14 October 2000"
"568","Recently I was playing a game with a friend where you had to match countries to flags. The Albaninan flag came up and I told my friend that this is one of the rather unknown flags which I nonetheless will always know to be the Albanian. And he responded that this is because of the Simpsons (In one episode there was an Albanian exchange student). For a moment I was surprised how he knew what I was going to say but I realized this is only one of many ""Simpsons moments"" many people have. Not many shows, honestly I think no other show is so versatile like the Simpsons. There are so many situations in life at least one ""simpsonesque"" gag or happening can be related to. This is probably one of the reasons the Simpsons is so popular. The show itself is an alternate universe that in almost every detail is a often a subtle to obvious satire to reality. I am 23 years old now and I am watching the show since I was a kid. Later on I was wondering if I ever got all the subtle references when younger. Surely not and probably I am still missing out many. It is the diversity and balance between slapstick, puns and plane social and political satire that kept me hooked while growing. People are often complaining about the show's decline in recent years and there is truth to it but season 19 did very well in my opinion. However if you rated every episode (all the great ones and the weaker ones) and took the average of it the outcome still is the greatest thing to ever hit television so far.Even if you prefer some other show more I am sure when the Simpsons go after their grand finale this year many will not only be missing a TV show they will be missing (I know it sounds exaggerated) a friend that accompanied us for so long and gave us so much laughter and more than one thought on society and ourselves...","10","3 April 2008"
"569","This show is funny. Homer always being thick-headed, well he has a crayon in is brain. Homer always gets waisted at Moe's tavern. Well speaking of Moe, Bart always gives him prank phone calls. I like Bart and Lisa because they're so oppisite from each other. Bart: Always getting in to trouble, always getting bad grades, and the class clown. Lisa: A well behaved person, Gets good grades, and the teacher's pet. Any way the Simpsons family may be the Wackiest you have ever seen. If you like A family with Homer (thick-headed, drinker, pig, and gambler), Marge (tall blue-headed, mother, always mad, and has Magie stick to her like glue), Bart (Class clown, trouble maker, and a Krusty clown fanatic), Lisa (smart, un-popular, sax playing, and teacher's pet), and Magie (binkie sucking, and shoots Mr. Burns) I'll just tell you that, that family is the wackiest family you would ever know.

"574","The Simpsons. I have been growing up with them, and still watch them to this day. The wit, the poking fun at itself, the endless jokes and ""smashing"" ideas. Homer and the rest of the family have become somewhat an icon of humour  the Simpsons make fun of their own creators, they satirise Western life-styles and stereotypes. There have been very few disappointing episodes to this date. And to all the people who say the Simpsons have gotten worse: No, I don't think so. Some episodes are perfect, some are great, some are good. But I can't think of any that was absolute rubbish. No wonder is this the most successful and the most popular cartoon-family in history. A truly unique and timeless show. I hope it will go on for another twenty seven (or more) seasons.","10","27 January 2016"

It has everything for everyone, and that is the not so secret of it's success.Helped by a fantastic writing team, I feel that the shows main family is well backed up by the residants of Springfield. Possibly two of the best back up characters Troy McClure and Lional Hutz are sadly long gone because of the tragic death of Phil Hartman.I think it's in The Simpsons show best interest that it should finish soon because it is losing it's freshness, but hopefully it will end in a full length film.Quite Simply the best animated show ever!",NA,"20 December 2002"
"576","The Simpsons......   Needless to say this is one of most important and influencial creations in American entertainment history.The strong social satyre, witty humor and wacky storylines have crossed the world and charmed the millions of people who watch it.This is a wild and very ""realistic"" show in its own way.  How many times do we see a big fat dumb guy with his kids doing big dumb things...?!!! Making fun at others very subtly and without offending nonetheless is a mark that has me still thinking of the pure genius Matt Groening, Sam Simon and James L. Brooks has-had and will have...Being a huge film fanatic, Hitchcock especially, I've been addicted to the beautiful hommages they made of some of history's most extraordinary film moments.  That ""Rear Window"" episode is a timeless classic, the babies playing ""The Birds"", Marge running in a field ""North by Northwest"", Maggie smashing Homer ""Psycho"", all these were very captivating and mesmerising.   
With this show, I've discovered what laughter is..  What entertainment is, what absurdity is, what art is...   I believe that as long as there will be news, politics, films, music, The Simpsons will exist.  
Who thinks that they should do an episode based on or with scenes of ""Fight Club""......?!!!  How weird and cool could that be....",NA,"11 May 2001"
"577","The Simpsons is currently the longest running animated show of all time. I see this show on television nearly every day. When it was first shown in Australia in 1991 I wasn't such a big fan then (I was 15). Now that I'm older I appreciate the humour and subtlety a whole lot more. Much of the humour lies not in the stories, but in the crudeness of the drawings. Bart's head reminds me of a paper bag (with a serrated edge). Lisa's hair is like a paper sun.Being an adult, I'm not ashamed of watching what looks like a children's cartoon. This is a cartoon with adult content, a pioneer for the shows that followed. What makes the show so cunning is that the adult humour is so cleverly hidden. There are many jokes within each episode that children just wouldn't get.Among my favourite episodes are the one where Homer joins a religious cult. I also like the one where Bart goes on a road trip with his friends and has to get work as a courier. Then there are those ones where Bart is a frequent target for Sideshow Bob's revenge. Has anyone noticed the number of Christmas and Halloween specials? None of the characters seem to get any older.The characters I like best are Sideshow Bob and the obnoxious guy who runs the comic book store.",NA,"11 January 2000"

All the celebrities they have on the show are excellent as well.I sincerely hope they do not make a movie because i think it will butcher the show. The great thing about the Simpsons is they are all totally different with Lisa, Bart, Homer, Marge and Maggie. I think that there is a little bit of each of them in all of us.With so Manny series made you would think that they would have exhausted all there ideas and i think that the other cartoon makers are a bit annoyed with them because the Simpson's have done almost everything.Bart is one of the best characters because he is everything that we wouldn't dare do so you can't help but love him.",NA,"13 February 2006"

How would you feel if that was a family member of yours that someone made such a cruel joke about?? I feel like the writers can do MUCH better than this and shouldn't stoop so low by making a joke out of someones tragic death. That was totally uncalled for. So my message is to the writers.

Some episodes like treehouse of horror 3 was the best parody's ever. So what I'm saying is, i love some episodes but others are embarrassing.

There's nothing too much or too less. It's true that sometimes the show can seem dated and that it doesn't really age well; but that can be perfectly solved... watching the next episode.

I love when Grampa, at times, is slow and frustrates the family and doesn't even realize that he is infuriating and boring the family. I love Homer's laziness, his carelessness and when he always gets angry with Bart. Technically, you know what I am talking' about. It logically occurs all the time. You know what I mean?

Sharing the whole stage is a huge, possibly record-breaking cast of all those yellow-skinned citizens, each with his or her very own distinctive background and personality (aaalllll the way from the very shady, womanizing Mayor Quimby down to the scowling little One-Eyebrowed Baby - along with a few really exotic characters tossed in like the Scottish school janitor and the cashier clerk from India) as well as the incredibly wide, most baffling gallery of celebrity caricatures (with their very OWN voices, to boot) ever to parade through our most favorite little make-believe town!

In fact, this nifty little show's got just about EVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE - even some really cool 3-D computer animation in a Halloween special!

Unfortunately, even then it won't always be 100% PERFECT, nor would everyone alive agree with it 100% of the time. For instance, it has a little sexist attitudes at times, like Homer and Bart both going off on big adventures (especially the part with the truck-driving and the big trip to a football game) while Marge and Lisa are left behind to sit at home. But nevertheless...this show is so damned cool I now religiously watch it EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT - whether it's closed-captioned or not!I'm afraid I have to disagree with some reviewers who think ""The Simpsons"" are going down the drain in those recent years. On the contrary, I think the show is as great as ever, aside from a few sexist stuff - and in fact, it seems to be getting better and better! Hey, how I would PROTEST if it ever GOES OFF THE AIR!!!

"586","One show is worthy of ""The Greatest Television Show Of All Time"". This title goes not to Malcolm in the Middle, not Family Guy, but the first animated dysfunctional family ever. Yes, The Simpsons.From 1986 to 1989, the Simpsons have been badly animated cartoon shorts on the Tracy Ullman show. Not minding the crude drawing, the vulgar humor, or the yellow skin, the Simpsons prevailed.In December 1989, the Simpsons took in a FOX timeslot, and aired its first full length animated episode. The drawings grew better, and it debuted with success. Soon, the episode library grew, and the rest is history.The plot is about a dysfunctional family, the Simpsons. Homer, the father; Lisa, the 8-year old scientist; Bart, the troublemaker; Marge, the cautious mother; and Baby Maggie. of course, there is also a wide array of characters, such as Krusty the Klown, a celebrity who overmerchandises; and Apu, the beloved Kwik-E-Mart clerk.The Simpsons, reaching its 2000 season, is a riot. The hundreds of guest stars-- Jay Mohr, The Who, Phil Hartman, and most recently: Drew Barrymore-- are included as well. Matt Groening is a genius. Who knew yellow, two-thirds-of-their-face-usually-shows characters could be so successful? With many plot twists, sight gags, signs, freeze-frame jokes, politically incorrect and politically correct jokes, and straight-out physical comedy will entertain the whole family. The kids snicker and laugh out loud at Homer's ""D'oh's and follies, as adults would laugh at the celebrity humor.So what's not to love?10/10 ""A great show and proud of it.""",NA,"13 November 2000"
"587","The Simpsons created a landmark in television history. No show had ever been as clever and witty as this. The humour is always perfect, humour that maybe some people will not understand. In my opinion, this show surpasses Family Guy, American Dad!, South Park etc in every way possible. The first 10 seasons of the show we're pure gems,(season 10 to a lesser extent) Each episode was hysterical and memorable, and always referred to as the Simpsons 'Golden Age'. Somewhere along the line, however, the writers dropped the ball and the quality of the show rapidly decreased. Season 11,12 and 13 still made me laugh, but I was fully aware that the 'Golden Age' was long gone. Season 14, in my opinion, saw the show drop to a new low and this continued for another few seasons. However, I thought somewhere in the middle of season 19, that the show was getting reasonably better. Season 20 began and I thought it was pretty good, particually the episode 'Coming To Homerica', which had me in stitches. Season 21 is currently airing and I have watched most episodes up to yet (which look unbelievable in HD), and so far I am impressed. One of my all-time favourite episodes is the season 8 episode 'Homers Phobia'. The writing is pure gold, and i'm still in stitches every time I watch it, and I must have seen it over 75 times! My favourite characters change every now and then, but currently (excluding the Simpsons family), i'd have to say Lenny & Carl or Mr Burns. In conclusion, I firmly believe this IS the best show to ever be shown on television, despite the declining quality. I still watch the Simpsons every time it's on Sky and I still love it as much as ever, even though some episodes can be disappointing. I was also thrilled by The Simpsons Movie, which is one of my favourite film's of all time!Season 1-9: 10/10 Season 10-18: 7/10 Season 19-21: 8/10","10","7 March 2010"
"588","Since it premiere in Christmas 1989 Fox's original comedy series The Simpsons has been the best comedy show on television. The Simpsons has run over ten years and has over 300 episodes, this show gave fox its good reputation and no comedy series can say they are better than The Simpsons.",NA,"1 June 2003"
"589","The Simpsons is the greatest comedy show ever made. The Simpsons evolved American society. They got us talking about corruption on both sides of American politics, gay rights, good and bad parenting, good pet ownership, the ethics of vegetarianism, the tropes in our entertainment, and just about everything else. The best animators (like Brad Bird) and the best comedy writers worked on The Simpsons, so their template acts as a perfect example for how to write comedy and animate--to the point that EVERYONE's ""ripped them off"". But the beauty of The Simpsons is that they ""ripped off"" everything they did. The Simpsons is the story of all of us. When the martians come down and ask for Our History, I'm handing them all the seasons of The Simpsons on DVD, or whatever they watch stuff on. The beauty of The Simpsons is that we are all the same, and everything's been done before, so you might as well create and express yourself freely. We are Springfield. We are Simpsons. Matt Groening is a God. Dan Castallaneta, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, Julie Kavner, Hank Azarea, and Harry Shearer are some of the best satirists, improvisers, and voice actors who ever lived.We are all Bart--We all feel unappreciated, because people decide to focus on our flaws instead of our talents. We've been influenced by bad people, and been a bad influence. We all seek thrills that hurt us and those around us. We are all Lisa-- We all feel unappreciated when we try to be the voice of reason and intelligence, and the people we love ignore us. We all feel like we're getting nowhere, despite our gifts. We all feel like we're trapped with people that'll never get us. We are all Marge-- We all feel unappreciated when we try to voice concern, and the people we love write us off as a nag. We all feel like we're being smothered by our loved ones, to the point that we'll never develop our own personality.We are all Homer--We all feel unappreciated when we don't deserve to. We're all mercurial and willfully ignorant. We all try to numb the pain of a life that'll never satisfy us, to the point of hurting our brains.We are all Maggie (thank you for reminding me allthereis_isnothing)-- We all feel unappreciated because we feel unheard and easily forgotten. We all have talents that we feel no one can see. And, if you do as many drugs as I do, you probably fall down a lot. They all never quite fit in, no matter how hard they try. They'll all never change. We all have bad parents, we'll all be bad parents (the ones of us that have kids), and we all find romance in codependency. Springfield is a human brain. Each inhabitant is a perfect representation of another piece of us. Shelbyville is another human brain. We hate each other for no reason, even though we're exactly the same.Drop acid and watch The Simpsons everybody. Now is the time of The Simpsons. God bless The Simpsons. NOTE: As a superfan I can't claim a definite ""favorite episode"" but the episode Bart Gets An F is definitely one of the best. The first episode of season 2. It perfectly illustrates all the frustrations felt by all creative, stupid, and flawed people.","10","19 October 2015"
"590","Some TV shows are smart, like ""Yes, Minister"". Some are dumb, like - um, everything else. But ""The Simpsons"" is so funny because it is both smart _and_ dumb. It thus appeals to everyone - no-one would find the show ""unfunny"" or ""uncool"" because it's so damn varied!!! From incredibly obscure references to phrenology, World War 2 and great movies - right up to Homer Simpson's dumb antics and sight gags, this show has got everything. Watch the Simpsons!!!",NA,"22 May 2000"
"591","The Simpsons is very influential. The comedy is very good and really has a great sense of sarcasim which makes a lot of fun for all ages. Homer is a lazy, beer drinking, potato watching TV most of the time but the cartoons as they go on with differnt stories have shown he is a loving, caring father and good husband from time to time. This makes the shows sad, funny and true. Bart, the little brat getting up to mischief all the time is just the typical 10 years old boy and Lisa, is the intelligent one. Marge is a normal house wife and a good mother. Homer really is the typical American man. Even the cartoon series 'King of the Hill' shows what the average American man is like. His hatred towards his holy, god worshiping neighbour, Ned Flanders.The series has everything, its just good fun, mainly for young people. However not every show is good but over all 88% of the series is great. Absolutely tremendous.",NA,"28 December 1999"
"592","I had no intention on putting in a comment on ""The Simpsons"", but after reading through the comments others have put in, I feel obligated to get my two cent's worth.  This is one of the greatest television shows ever produced; subversive, funny, deep.  It takes great advantage of it's animated format to get away with things other shows can not.  Continuity is not a concern.  As far as the creators are concerned, each episode is entirely self-contained, with no connection from one to another (except when they feel like it.  That's the beauty).  They can be more creative that way. Watch the show.  Tape it and watch it again.  I guarantee that you will see something you missed....jokes that are on-screen for a split second, you will miss them the first time, but later catch them and laugh.  Watch the back-ground.  The true genius of any TV show or movie comedy is in the depth of the comedy.  The Simpsons layers it.  A joke can occur in the foreground or the background.  A punchline in season 9 can often times refer to something that happened in season 3, put in as a treat to the true hardcore fan.  That is the genius of this show.Those who say that the show has slipped, frankly, they are correct.  But to slip from such a peak, it is still a fantastic satire, and I would hope it continues for many more years.  And to those of you who wish the show to be taken off the air, I leave you with this:  CHANGE THE CHANNEL AND LET THE REST OF US ENJOY THIS SHOW!!!",NA,"17 July 2001"
"593","I only give this show a 8 because of the modern seasons.","8","7 August 2021"
"594","I have been a huge Simpsons fan for over 13 years.Year after year they come up with more and more original ideas for plots and pop culture jokes.However,the show got to be hit-and-miss after 1998,seasons 2-7 were kickass,season 8 was cool but kinda old,season 9 started the decline a little,i watch reruns of seasons 8-13 now and i laugh at what i missed.The characters are so funny.We got the lazy father Homer,the always-mad and conservative Marge,the smart teacher's pet Lisa,the wise-cracking troublemaker Bart,the scrooge-like Mr.Burns,the ambigously gay Waylon Smithers,the immigrant Apu,the cynical Krusty The Klown,the by-the-book Principal Seymour Skinner,the devoted christian Ned Flanders and many more.I love episodes like""The Way We Was"",""Mr.Plow"",""Round Springfield""(the most poignant episode),""Lisa The Vegetarian"",""Duffless"",""Brush With Greatness"" and ""Summer of Ft.2"".One Of my all-time faves is ""Homer Vs.Lisa and The 8th Commandment"".Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up.Bart and Lisa find out about Hell at sunday school and obying the 10 commandments,one of which is Though Shall Not Steal,Lisa thinks illegal cable is stealing,but Homer disagrees and invites friends over for the boxing match on TV.After Lisa protests against it Homer comes to his senses and unhooks the cable and the static comes up ending the episode.A Classic.The highlight was Lisa's daydream of being in Hell and the devil telling her cable won't cost her a thing except her soul.Very funny moment.Anyways,The Simpsons is the greatest show ever,i hope it stays fresh and original until the end in 2005 and i hope they continue putting the seasons out on DVD.10 out of 10.",NA,"24 February 2003"
"595","The Simpsons has been one of the most famous, celebrated and longest running cartoons of all time! Most people know who they are! Season 2-8 are full of iconic moments but it is no secret that it has dipped in quality quite a lot.The Simpsons started of as a cartoon showing an average American family but gradually became more like a cartoon and more wild storylines.A good example of the Simpsons decrease of quality and increase in wacky stories would be a story like ""Marge Be Not Proud"" which tells a story of Bart becoming so desperate for a game that he is caught stealing it from the shop and there are real consiquences in the story and you now get stories like ""Lisa Goes Gaga"" (the worst Simpsons episode by far) where Lady Gaga goes to Springfield to make Lisa feel good about herself as if she is her goddess or something.Another example of the decrease in quality is characters is that a few characters have been made crazier and ""flanderized"". The two biggest examples is Homer Simpson and Ned Flanders. Homer used to be a bit stupid but was a caring and loving man but nowadays, he is known as ""jerk-ass Homer"". This Homer is so stupid, has no care of what he does and gets away with it all. Fans do not like this character Change at all.Ned Flanders was just a very kind guy who was also a Christian but now, he is a devoted Christian who is all about giving to church and is sometimes mean to people who are not Christian! This ""flanderisation"" has happened to many characters that have one of their character traits cranked up to 110%.Overall, The Simpsons is not what it once was but I think it still deserves 9/10 for all of the classic and great episodes there are of it!","9","14 August 2020"
"596","This show is my favoriot show ever. Everything is so clever and funny. Or at least it used to be. The last season and a half it has sometimes just been stupid. The middle six episodes were some of the funniest things I have ever seen. Latly it has been so unreal it is not fun to watch. In the middle seasons the show made fun of things that were realistic and happen to all the time, now Homer just acts so crazy and the plots are just bouncing off the walls. Let me show you an example. In one episode in the good seasons, Bart needs money for a comic book. So he works for some old lady. This turns into a series of hilarious events. Such as making Bart take some candy then all the candy sticks together, or Bart having to pull the weeds and there are hundreds. Little gags like that made it enjoyable. In a recent episode a bad one, Homer becomes a truck driver. This is all ready rediculous. Then there is a machine that does the driving for him. Then he does a flip over a convoy and lands saftly. At the end it seems like the writers just gave up on having any good ending so they end the show with him driving a nuclear train back to Springfield. Pathetic attempt for some cheap laughs.  This show is still my favorite show and I never want it to go off. I love all the characters from Krusty to Willie. But I hope in the future the show will go back to being humor people can relate to.",NA,"29 June 2000"
"597","What can I say? This show has been on practically as long as I've been alive (minus 6 months and 27 days, to be exact)! And anything that lasts that long has to be good.   Brilliantly funny show- unsurpassed. Almost everyone I knowwatches it. And it's pretty clear that the writers aren'tjust churning out episode after episode just to satisfy thedemand for the show to continue. They still seem to be enjoyingthemselves. My favorite episode is the early one where the Simpsons buy a trailer and get lost in the woods.  ""The Simpsons"" frequently makes me laugh out loud. It's simply the funniest, most original, most brilliant, ingenious show in the history of television!LONG LIVE THE SIMPSONS",NA,"9 December 2000"
"598","As you can probably tell by my name, I love the Simpsons. It is my all time favorite show. The earlier seasons are so good. Nearly every episode makes me laugh out loud! I am not as critical of the later seasons, but they aren't nearly as good. But there are enough gems in the later seasons to redeem the bad ones. This show perfectly balances humor and humanism. This is a great show that everyone should watch.","10","24 October 2021"

I cannot believe how long this show has been going, I've watched this show since it started and its never been better. The best episode ive seen would be trilogy of error. Homer cutting off his thumb, Bart finds smuggled fireworks, and Lisa goes to the wrong school. Thats great!Devil Dude's Rating: 9.5/10 donuts!",NA,"25 November 2003"
"601","We used to watch this show nonstop! We've since had classic animated series like Family Guy and South Park and American Dad and so many more newer ones but nothing can beat the Simpsons.Everyone always says the earlier ones were better but I disagree there I kind of like it around 2000 and sometimes a bit later. I think every era has great episodes though. Even the new series I still like!","10","17 September 2017"
"602","Only one of the fantastic one-liners from ""The Simpsons"", it shows perfectly what this dysfunctional, anarchistic sitcom is all about. ""The Simpsons"" is one of the few shows (let's face it, almost the ONLY) that actually gets better by the season. In early episodes, when the animation was still quite crude and rugged and the actors seemingly hadn't nailed their voices quite yet, the series seemed to rely mostly on its ""we're portraying a REAL family, unlike other sitcoms""-status. The jokes were a little childish and easy, back then. Apparently Groening wanted to lure the audience in and tie them to his own particular brand of humor later on. And boy, what humor did it evolve into. The second and third seasons became more and more directed towards a more intelligent crowd; with the jokes for kids mainly used as fillers. But the sheer orgasms of absurd humor it has become now. From rhino's laying eggs to a giant log rolling through America with an enormous depiction of Lisa's head on it to the f***ed up finale of the episode with that secret society (""Yeees... the island!!!"")... Kudos to you, Matt Groening. Kudos. Don't ever stop. You won't stop. Cause you can't stop.",NA,"3 August 2002"
"603","This television cartoon is one of my favorite animated sitcoms along with other TV cartoons such as Family Guy, South Park, American Dad and King Of The Hill. I for one really like this show, along with Family Guy in which I have already mentioned. There seems to be both funny moments as well as serious moments, even though about 75% of the show is comedy, and it's also realistic (more so than Family Guy), although sometimes it gets a little too surreal when something implausible happens, but the surreal moments usually have an explanation as well as being hallucinations or dreams (the only truly surreal episodes are the Halloween specials, alias Treehouse Of Horror). As much as I like the TV show for its stupidity (which is essential in comedy, in a good way of course), one of the things that bothers me about the show, or shall I say the whole franchise, is that there seems to be a significant, although certainly not universal, perception that it's a ""family"" show, and that is not true at all, and also there are people who think that TV shows like Family Guy and South Park are more mature than it. Bull-crap! In any case, The Simpsons is no less mature than Family Guy nor South Park. In fact, the primary creator Matt Groening originally never intended The Simpsons to be for ""family viewing"". Though surely there were kids who watched it with their parents in, let's say 1990, but it wasn't meant for that audience. The Simpsons was originally a group of 1 1/2 minute shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show and it was almost like South Park for its crude artwork. Then finally, The Simpsons became its very own sitcom since 1989. The series was the South Park and Family Guy of its time, also predating the shows on the late-night Cartoon Network line-up Adult Swim. Personally, I wish The Simpsons were on Adult Swim. But anyways, I also want to say that I regret watching this show as a child (I was 12 at the time), but in retrospect it was the wrong age for me to watch the show or associate with the entire franchise. I even encouraged a 3- year-old to watch the show, how stupid I was back then! Besides, if it really were ""family- friendly"" or as I prefer the term ""kid or child-friendly"", it needs to have no bad language, bloody violence, sex, nudity, tobacco, alcohol, controversial topics and very crude humor. I for one personally think that The Simpsons, and also Family Guy, should not be viewed by anyone under 13 or 14 year old, but to be ""legal"" I would say not for viewers under 17. I Love The Simpsons.",NA,"28 May 2015"
"604","What more can I possibly say about a TV show that has already been praised to death? I was 15 when the Simpsons first aired and I'm 25 now. I've seen every single episode, and I'd have to say it's a rare combination of factors that come together to make The Simpsons the best show ever.It's a very clever and intelligent show - they never dumb anything down - and as creator Matt Groening has remarked, ""The Simpsons is a show that rewards paying attention."" There are always enough obscure pop-culture references or subtle background gags to ensure that the second, third, or tenth viewing of an episode will find you noticing something you hadn't before.In the early days of The Simpsons, they derived a large part of their popularity from the everyday, down-to-earth, unglamorous, average-blue-collar-slob aspect of the Simpson family. Homer is lazy and doesn't like his job, Bart doesn't excel at school, the plastic ketchup bottle they use at the dinner table makes that farting sound, and so on. This aspect of the program contrasts it with popular 80's family sitcoms such as The Cosby Show which always featured impossibly well-functioning families who got along a little too perfectly and usually learned a neat little lesson at the end of each episode. An early tag-line for The Simpsons said that they ""put the Fun back in Dysfunctional."" Perhaps this blue-collar-slobness by itself is nothing shockingly original - think of previous TV shows such as Roseanne, Married with Children, All in the Family, The Honeymooners - but the Simpsons doesn't stop there. This show is extremely densely packed with jokes - everything from cerebral witticisms and sly satire to Homer falling down and going ""D'oh!"" Because it's a cartoon, the writers can get away with surreal gags such as the time Homer tells a joke which falls flat, after which a long silence happens which is punctuated by a single tumbleweed rolling through the Simpson's living room.There are just too many things to mention about The Simpsons. It can be touching occasionally; more often the viewers are treated to an unequalled cavalcade of obscure references, surreal sight gags, wacky adventures, self-mocking irony... The list goes on and on. Just watch it, else you're missing out on one of the most important elements of 1990's popular culture. Viva Simpsons","10","15 May 2010"

Contrary to popular opinion, the show has actually gotten Better over the past season or so. Marge's Canyonero ... that episode is one of the best of all time. I quote The Simpsons all the time, not to be funny, but because I've watched it So Often that the lines just come to me. It's a sickness, really. Even the episodes I absolutely can't stand (the George Bush ep, for instance) have something to redeem them (""It's a CANDY dish, Ned! Ninety dollars!,"" the introduction of Disco Stu, etc.). The Simpsons can't even be compared to other sitcoms bec. it's not a fair contest. They can do more w/ animation than a live show can ever hope to do.

There seems to be an infinite amount of different possible plots, and different actors appearing on the show.  This could really be one of those shows that your kids' kids' will still grow up watching.  If you haven't seen this show, and think it is gross or something, you are wrong.

"612","The Simpsons is one of the greatest sitcoms of all time and is one of my personal favorite shows. **SPOILER ALERT** One of my personal favorite episodes is ""Bart the Daredevil"" from season 2 where Homer made his infamous jump over Springfield Gorge on Bart's Skateboard to only crash land at the bottom. Another episode I like is the one where they had the outtakes that previously were never aired before, which included the alternate ending to ""Who Shot Mr. Burns"". Over the years, Homer has progressively gets funnier every year, but concurrently gotten stupider, but Bart is my favorite character, and I will never forget the time he tried to get a tattoo and it had to be removed by laser, which used up all the Christmas money. and after that episode, I acted out the scene on my cousin where Bart kept saying ""Ow, Quit It!"". As for the current episodes, their okay, but I like the older reruns, which will be played forever.

"613","The Simpsons is my all-time favorite show. I don't get how anyone could think Family Guy is better. There isn't anyone I can relate to in Family Guy and none of the characters in that show project any heart or wit. The Simpsons has a very well developed cast of characters. The writing is simply brilliant. Each episode has hilarious gags, interesting plots, and clever satire. The amazing thing about The Simpsons is that it can go into any type of genre. One episode could be a character-driven story, the next episode could be a movie parody. The music is excellent, unlike most TV productions. There is absolutely nothing The Simpsons can't accomplish. It just has that special something that so many other cartoons lack. Most people complain about the dipping quality. While I will admit that seasons 3-8 are better, the later seasons are still awesome in my opinion. There isn't really a single episode where I haven't laughed once.

Soon FOX bought it and it had it's own independant series in 1989. The writers put a lot of hard work into this show. It's very funny, very very funny. The humor is often contradicted, stupid-funny, and a lot of eye candy sneaks in. But it's all in great fun. This you will enjoy very much, and it's on it's like 12th or 11th season.

I love the way Homer is just that slight bit less intelligent than his friends and relatives, i like the fact that each character is unique and i especially like Moe he is the king.Sadly though the serious has begun to slip into decline as it nears its 14th or 15th season, yes it has been on the air for over 10 years and the drawing has become top-notch now it is done on the computer.  But now the storylines are just getting all to familiar,linear or completley stupid, there is the odd joke that will make me laugh but one can see that ideas are becoming scarce.I would hate to see The Simpsons go out on a bad note say in about another 4 years time after everyone is sick of them (god forbid), but i think it is time for them to go out on a big bang with all the best remaining ideas and send them to the holy comedy club in the sky.Thank you for the best 10 years of my life",NA,"11 January 2004"
"618","""The Simpsons"" is an excellent show and possibly the greatest show in the world. I'm very glad that they've made it 419 episodes! The characters on this show are fantastic. Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Mr. Burns, Smithers, Patty, Selma, Krusty, Milhouse, Ralph Wiggum, Mrs. Krabappel, Principal Skinner, and all the other characters are great! My all time favorite episodes are Rosebud, A Star is Burns, Lisa's Wedding, King-Size Homer, Homer's Barbershop Quartet, Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire, Lisa's First Word, and New Kid on the Block. The Simpsons Movie is great too! Though I might say, some of the episodes from seasons 10 to now aren't very good. But some of them are great, like Moe Baby Blues and Don't Fear the Roofer.Thank you Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, and all the other voice actors for providing this great show. But especially thanks to Matt Groening and James L. Brooks for creating this great show.","10","4 July 2008"
"619","What can I say about the Simpsons that hasn't been said already!  The more I watch the show, the more I realise that the writers have some alterior motive hidden in it.  As with all truly brilliant satire as the Simpsons is, the writers gloriously pass off their own opinions about the follies of contemporary society as the character's, brilliantly disguising some of it as Homer's stupidity or Bart's naughtiness.  The list is endless. 
But in the tradition of great satire they can never see a belt without hitting below it!",NA,"23 January 2002"

"621","When The Simpsons first came on TV, it was so incredibly clever and witty you'd hardly believe what you saw. The character development was fantastic, the writing superb. It seemed almost perfect. (My all time favorite episode is 'The Way We Was.' That being how Marge and Homer met in high school...still love it!) I also liked it better when Bart was the center of the show rather than Homer. There's so many classics from the early-mid '90s! But now, it's gotten so incredibly horrible. Now I don't mean 'I don't like this' horrible, I mean HORRIBLE! This started after 1997 or so when the writing became sub-par. And the producers seem to be quite aware of how much this show has declined. So why aren't they retiring it and only showing reruns? I wish I knew. I don't even bother myself with watching the new episodes anymore. I gave up on that quite a while ago. I will always love this show, but only the golden years thank you very much.
But just because this show has crashed and burned doesn't mean Matt Groening's creativity has. 'Futurama' is just as good as The Simpsons in their heyday!",NA,"19 August 2001"
"622","The Simpsons of the 1990's was arguably the greatest show ever. Not the greatest animated show ever but the greatest show ever. The ride of this show is quite interesting.We all know The Simpsons began as a sketch on the Tracy Ulman Show in the 80's. They spun it off, made a Christmas episode on prime time for the premier, and it quickly became a hit.The interesting part of this 'ride' is that the first 2 or 3 seasons focused on Bart Simpson. Bart was the star and everybody else played second fiddle. 'Eat my shorts', 'Don't have a cow man', 'Cowabunga', etc. Those were famous Bart quotes of the first 2 or 3 seasons that were also plastered on many kid's t-shirts.To most, the first 2-3 years are considered very good years but dated nonetheless. It was kind of raw, both animation and the characters, and when the show is compared the following period it doesn't hold up well. When most people remember the best episodes or best moments, they tend to be in the era shortly after the first 2/3 years. It hasn't held up as well as season 3/4 to about 10 or 11. Those are the 'Simpson Golden Years'. What happened in those years? Well, they switched the focus from the bratty troublesome little boy Bart to what would become the greatest character of all time....Homer Simpson.Homer Simpson has topped many polls and lists of greatest character of all-time, and rightfully so. He is loving father deep down but flawed in some many ways. He embodies the American working class stereotype from being lazy and fat to being ignorant and crude. Watching the first few seasons again, you'll notice that the first season or two he had a very monotone voice and was not quite as lively .Around season 3 he became the Homer we came to know and love and by season 4 he was the star with Bart taking a back seat.Homer Simpson could be the most quoted character of all time. His trademark 'D'oh!' in now part of the Dictionary. His famous phrases like ""to alcohol, the cause of and solution to all of life's problems"" can be heard from various people who grew up on The Simpson. Homer had a knack for saying the memorable.The first 10 or 11 years saw this show become such a worldwide cultural phenomena that even though the movie was releases after it's 17th season and about 6 years after the last good year, the movie broke box office records. It opened up to over $70M on its first weekend en route to $183M domestic and $525M worldwide. One can only imagine how much better it would have done had it been released during it best years.Around 2000, the show started to 'lose it'. It tried competing with more crude shows like Family Guy and South Park. The lovable characters became annoying at times and the show began to run out of ideas. 2002 or 2003 saw the show become a has-been. The rating began to tank. It was no longer funny. Since then, it's had some good episodes but never a strong a season. It has stayed on because even though the rating began to tank around 2002, they have stabilized and still draw a respectable number. No longer a top 20 or top 30 ratings hit, it does enough to survive. That basically sums up the last few seasons....it gives us just enough to survive but not enough to remember these episodes.","10","10 July 2010"
"623","The Simpsons is really not much more than a smarter, more diverse and richer animated version of Married with Children. But as MWC is a reviled show by many, The Simpson's is much beloved. Why? Probably the characters. The characters are the show's biggest strength. Indeed, The Simpson's world is so diverse with different characters representing different parts of humanity that most people can at least relate to some part of the show (no character with a disability though. I guess that's not funny.) Burns represents the greedy robber barons of capitalism, Apu represents the foreign invasion of gasoline Marts, Wiggum represents the cops, Moe and Barny represent the bar culture, etc, etc, etc. In having so many different characters, the show never gets stale (it couldn't to last as long as it has.) If one show focuses on one character, another show focuses on another. Eventually, characters touched on in previous episodes can rotate and pop up every now and again, which become cameo delights. The real genius of the show lies in how the character's personalities, wants, desires, etc are presented with such high intelligence, width of knowledge, development and, of course, humor. Politicians are on the take (often like life), cops are incompetent (often like life), robber barons are bitter old loners out to rule the world with money and power (often like life.) The show does have it's stereotypes for the sake of stereotypes but stereotypes are also part of life. The show also shows tremendous care for details and continuity and shows as much love and respect in some directions as it shows blatant disrespect in others. The people behind The Simpson's are very liberal and the show has a definite liberal slant to it. Still, the show doesn't fail to put certain things into the proper perspective in many cases. Alcoholics exist and can be funny but alcoholism is very bad. The show takes great care to illustrate such truths in the Homer and Barney characters. Homer is a mainstream drunk, Barney is a down and out drunk but both are considered and displayed as incompetent social inferiors. Ned Flanders is an idiotic goofball but he is a cheery guy who means well and the show takes pains to illustrate that Flanders is a solid member of society, who succeeds where guys like Homer fail, because Flanders is a good guy. That he is so naive is his cross to bear and shines a better light on characters like Homer in that respect. In that way, The Simpson's universe has balance and pays homage to the superb development of the characters over the show's run. The show centers around the Simpson family itself, of course. Homer is the drunk loser. Marge is the classic enabler. Bart is the wise a** and Lisa is the kid who tries to be brilliant enough to get away from these people. In this way, the central characters are Married with Children like, except Lisa is a brain and is not promiscuous and Marge is a good wife and not a bad one. The Homer and Al Bundy characters are classic couch potatoes with bum, dead end jobs and not much growth overall in life. The Simpsons' world has lasted much longer and has been much more critically acclaimed due to the characters in that world. Their personalities are all funny and, truly, there is not one really bad and unfunny character in the show, a testament to the overall artistic evolution of those behind the scenes. At times, The Simpsons is irresponsible in a Beavis and Butthead like way (can't you see Bart on the couch with Beavis and Butthead?) and the humor crosses the line at times and is weak, pathetic, ignorant, unnecessary and cruel. I guess these things happen when you've been on the air for so long. The richness of the Simpson's world helps it overcome such problems and the tremendously educated humor, while biased and frequently one-sided, is still funny enough in problem spots and genius enough overall to make this show last, maybe forever, and much of the humor is in good spirits. The show has become part of popular culture on a level with shows like Seinfeld, All in the Family and The Cosby Show.",NA,"25 December 2004"
"624","It'd Almost Be impossible if you own a TV not to have seen the show at least once then BAM! your hooked.After 18 seasons and almost 20 years of prime TV slots how could You doubt any Part of it? Matt Groening deserves 400 medals for each episode aired so far.I really can not think of what life would be like without the simpsons, and it has given us such immortal lines like in ""The Lemon of troy"" ""(shelbyvillian kids Dad) Ha Ha you must be stupider than you look!"" ""(Homer) Yea ... Stupid like a FOX!"" or in ""Homer vs the 18th admentment"" ""(Homer) To Alchahol the cause and solution to all of lifes problems"".In My view it's impossible to not like any part of any episode th voiceing is great (Credit going to Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Harry Shearer, Hank Azaria, Pamela Hayden etc etc) the storys are great and it's literally impossible not to love this show if i could I'd give it a 12/10","10","16 July 2007"
"625","Eh, just let the Simpsons end already. We don't need one or two more seasons. The show has been slowly dying ever since two or three seasons ago (maybe longer). And yeah, the people involved with the movie said it'd take years for the movie to be made. They have to come up with fresh material, which is a set-back right there as we've clearly seen all this time, plus it'd take a lot of strenuous work for everything else to happen. They've also said they hope the fans won't lose their interest with the show by the time it gets released. Got to take all that into account, along with fans already losing interest what with the episodes not delivering like they used to. But I know there's still lots more out there, just not as many as when the show first kicked off.",NA,"9 November 2004"
"626","The Simpsons is the second best show ever. It has a delicious mixture of characters. It is definitely a satire. My favorite character would have to be Montgomery Burns.

It's that small humor that makes this one of the best shows ever.",NA,"6 April 1999"
"627","This cartoon was once the greatest animated series of all time.  It deals with every issue that mankind can relate to all the way from politics to simple family troubles.

At least while their still popular",NA,"10 April 2003"
"628","For me, The Simpsons is, by far, the best television show of all time. The way the humour is created so a single episode contains jokes ranging from Homer tripping and falling to an elaborate parody of Citizen Kane, means that it appeals to people of all ages. I know that personally, I have grown up watching this TV show, and the intertextuality means I can often watch episodes over and over again and discover new things each time.Admittedly the later seasons aren't as good as the earlier ones with endings which rarely resolve the storylines presented throughout the episodes, but still, The Simpsons is better than many shows on air now. I know I will greatly miss this show when it ends.",NA,"19 May 2003"
"629","""The Simpsons"" is one of the best comedy shows that ever graced the television screens. Even thought it's been going for nearly 12 years, it remains fresh and downright humorous, and it hosts many references to tv shows, movies, celebrities and literature.The voices are excellent and many of the storylines were excellent, although there were some I didn't like, such as when Bart worked at a burlesque in ""Bart After Dark"". But most episodes I find extremely funny, such as ""When Flanders Failed"" and ""Miracle On Evergreen Terrace"".""The Simpsons"" still remains popular, and I hope its popularity doesn't dwindle. I rate this series 8.5 out of 10.",NA,"1 March 2000"
"630","I love this show. I consider myself to be a Simpsons latebloomer. The show started when I was only 12, so I didn't really understand most of the jokes. Now that I'm an adult, I can really appreciate the humor because I've been around a lot longer and I now understand where the jokes are coming from. The jokes are reality-based, but the creators push the envelope a little further, so that the show becomes both satirical and surreal at the same time. They've managed to make the show both very real and very unreal. The fact that the show's creators have managed to actually do something like that SUCCESSFULLY is one of the many reasons I love this show.",NA,"26 August 2000"
"631","After about the eighth or ninth season, the show just went kerplotz. It's not good anymore. It was funny before, but has just gone down the tubes. It ended where Family Guy started: senseless and ridiculous. I hope it soon meets the same fate that Family Guy did.",NA,"9 November 2003"
"632","The Simpsons is my all time favorite show of all time.  The series started out slow enough with some minor laughs every once and a while.  After a while the series became an icon for the same audience of Married with Children.  The show poked fun at the way the real life American family lived.  They didn't all come together and talk about problems they sat around in their underwear eating Microwave dinners.  Every one from A. Aaronson to Mr. Zykowski loves this series.  One currently tying for the longest running series of all time.  It's a dream come true.",NA,"27 October 2002"

"635","The Simpsons was once a brilliant animated comedy about a dysfunctional family living in a dysfunctional town. In fact it could one of the best television shows of all time.However the Simpsons has been going down hill for quite a while now. I'm not sure when, but a while ago it started using the same story lines and becoming unfunny. Even if a storyline is original, it's pretty boring. Most of the new episodes are very boring. There is a cause. It has gone on too long. Now at season 24 and episode 528, it's safe to say they've ran out of ideas.My advice to Matt Groening is stop at 25. Make a real effort to make an epic series finale and let that be that. Maybe make another movie. The first movie was pretty good compared to the modern episodes. Matt, stop Simpsons and focus on Futurama. It hasn't been running long and still has great potential.","8","9 July 2013"

Very few have matched its comedy and none have matched its intellect. It is utterly simple if you watch it to have a laugh but if you watch it and actually look and concentrate on the dialogues/screenplay/characters, you have just entered a new world where the complexities of seemingly comic simplicity are extremely tough to find.It is simple on the outside but mind-bogglingly complex if you want to actually look.","10","4 September 2007"

Not only is the show funny, it takes knowledge of pop culture and a keen eye to notice and understand all the jokes.

"644","I feel disappointed because it was decided that Harry Shearer will continue to voice his characters in this animated comedy. Why? I have no idea at all. But I compare this situation with Sega's decision about Dr. Ivo ""Eggman"" Robotnik's voice occurred in 2010. Sega decided that the voice recording for Sonic the Hedgehog's nemesis should remain in New York City. Therefore, Mike Pollock is still his official voice actor. I really hoped that Dr. Ivo ""Eggman"" Robotnik's voice actor will be recast for Studiopolis' intentions. But this attempt failed, of course. I strongly believe that James L. Brooks supported Harry Shearer's fallout with the famous Simpson family. However, this fallout was unsuccessful. With no reason, Sega decided that Dr. Ivo ""Eggman"" Robotnik will continue to speak with Mike Pollock's voice. And this year, it was decided that Harry Shearer will continue to provide voices to his characters, also without any reason.","10","8 August 2015"

I know Homer is a little nutty, but I think that he is such a hysterically funny man! He may not exist in real life, but I will tell you this much: I own the movie! I just can't stop myself from watching the funniest movie on Planet Earth! I may be saying a large statement, but that's fine with me. I love Homer I can't stop liking him! No Matter What!!!!!!!!!

Even their halloween specials which are like the best episodes of the series even suck....the couch gag munster's rip-off was crap and so was the garbage put in that one. Plus the bible story episode was really retarded as was the simpsons: behind the laughter(usually when they rip off something in the older seasons, it was hilarious and fresh, now its awful, old and i cant even crack a smile).  these episodes are abmyssibally bad and if i had matt groening's address or email address, he'd be getting a letter from me to cancel.if you've never watched the simpsons, you are deprived. but if you've never seen the newer seasons, take my word on it, you aren't deprived. if you haven't seen them, do yourself a favor and don't even bother.",NA,"8 December 2000"

Marge- A loving mother who wants to raise her kids as well as possible although she's a regular church-goer and is so nice that she can't choose who to vote for in the US election's because she see's the nice in both candidates she can't get the backing she deserves from Homer! Lisa- She is a very brainy young girl who in the future will (has been proved on Simpsons) become the President!!! She has a high IQ and is the smartest out of all the Simpsons children. Bart- He is a very bad student and alway's gets in trouble. He's a typical boy and loves to have ""real"" fun! Maggie- She is very underestimated she once shot Mr. Burns and although she can't walk or talk she is super smart often proved in episode's. That's the family so if you want a good old laugh go to ""The Simpson's"" and grab yourself a ""Duff Beer"" !!! P.S. It's not true (to me) that ""The Simpson's"" has got worse.

The show has been around since 1989 for a reason. Its humor, which never fails to make me laugh at least a couple of times each episode, tends to be a tad obscene at times, yet it never gets 'out of hand' to a point where I would not allow my (future) children to watch this show.This must be one of my favorite cartoons as well as one of my favorite shows, and I can only recommend it to everyone else who enjoys excellent comedy.

I find myself constently watching the reruns on UPN, turn to my dad and say ""Remember when the Simpsons was funny?""  I can only find Matt Groaning's humor in his latest work Futurama which is probably the funniest show on t.v. but I fear it will have a similliar fate to the Critic.  I only watch the Simpsons now for two reasons firstly, so that I can say I've seen every episode, and secondly just in a hope that it will be funny, which it never is.

"655","Note: this review is only for the original episodes (seasons 1 through 9) since all the new ones, for the most part, are horrible.
""The Simpsons"" is a satire-comedy-drama centering around a blue collar family living in Springfield, U.S.A.  The show features Homer Simpson, the not-so-bright, short tempered but loving father, Marge, the stereo-typical mother with a repressed rebellious streak, mischievious underachiever son Bart, intelligent social outcast Lisa, and the silent pacifer-sucking infant Maggie.  The episodes find the family in one situation after another ranging from marital problems between Homer and Marge (season 2, ""The War of the Simpsons"") to Homer being blasted into space (season 5, ""Deep Space Homer""). You never quite know what you are going to get when an episode starts. The writers have a unique ability to make you believe anything, so they can have a wild joke along with a heart-felt message and the two will seem to go hand-in-hand.  The show's comedy is very, very, very funny, from hilarious dialogue to outrageos sight gags.  On the other hand, the show's drama is also very good.  Anyone who says otherwise needs to watch the season 2 episode ""Lisa's Substiture"" with Dustin Hoffman or season 6's ""Lisa's Wedding"" (the flash-forward episode) to see the light.  Satire is also rampant in the series, from bashing political parties (season 6, ""Sideshow Bob Roberts) to talking about the effect of violent television on young minds (season 2, ""Ithcy and Scratchy and Marge"").  The show mixes all of these perfectly.  If you have never seen an original episode of the show go out and purchase the DVDs or videos or whatever you can find.  You are missing a great show!My rating of the show out of 4 stars: 10!!!!!!!",NA,"17 May 2002"
"656","If you mix a great storyline, memerable lines, numerous sight gags, a very talented cast, and catchy music you get The Simpsons, THE GREATEST SHOW IN THE HISTORY OF TELEVISION.The show centers around a family living in Springfield, USA.  Homer (the thick-headed father, husband, and safety supervisor at the nuclear powerplant), Marge (the sterio-typed mother and wife), Bart (the michievious son), Lisa (the genius younger sister), and Maggie (the baby) make up the Simpson family.The show storylines are sometimes far fetched, but they are so well written that nobody realizes that (like when Bart won the elephant.) The show also to pokes fun at everything but the show stops from letting the jokes ruin the plot.Many shows have tried creating knock-offs of Simpsons (like Dinosaurs), but none of them have been able to achieve the same popularity.The only problem with the show is the more recent episodes.  Things happen in the show that would never happen in the original episodes, screwing up the show's continuity.  The show is more like you average Saturday morning childrens cartoon than the witty, adult show that it used to be. The first seven or eight seasons of the show are great with more dramatic  and complex plots.  The rest of the seasons have simpiler plots filled with slapstick. Also, the characters in the first eight seasons were also more complex. Homer was thickheaded and mean, but still had a very loving and caring side and would do anything to make his family happy.  Now Homer is an idiot who doesn't care about anyone but himself.  Mr. Burns (Homer's ancient boss) origanlly had many dramatic lines and was a very realisitic character. Now, Mr. Burns is more like Saturday morning cartoon super villian. The only reason I still watch the show is because I am a very loyal Simpson fan. I want to know everything about every episode. The show still throws in an ok episode once and a while. I watch the old episodes to see the complexness of the characters and plots, but now I watch the show to get a good laugh.  If you like insane and immature humor and slapstick watch the newer episodes. If you like dramatic plots mixed with a little bit of humor, watch the older episodes.In the end, the show still remains the greatest television show ever made.Rating: On a scale of one to ten: The newer episodes get a five out of ten.  The originals get a thousand out of ten.",NA,"18 November 2000"

I think it should be running until the world ends,it just never gets old NEVER. And my personal favorite character is sideshowbob.",NA,"25 July 2001"
"659","It had to happen sooner or later, and it did happen later rather than sooner. Does anyone actually enjoy this show anymore? The jokes are lame, becoming more and more immature with every show, etc. It just seems like they're running out of material, something that happens to all TV shows that go on this long. I used to be one of the biggest Simpsons fans there was, watching every new episode religiously, but now it's just garbage.Yes, I do still watch every episode, hoping it's going to revert to actually being funny. The only time I've laughed for four series is at Homer's Popeye impersonation (""I need some fuel for my mule, some gas for my ass.""), the fact that that's the best the show can do is surely a major insult.Now that we've got/had other similar series (South Park, Duckman, Family Guy, Futurama) I can safely say that my found memories and many other people's fond memories are because this was first, it had nothing to compete with to be the best. All the other series I've mentioned are smarter, funnier and more socially aware (even Futurama), not to mention their far better storylines. The earlier episodes of The Simpsons were great, but still not as good as what the other series have to offer. Perhaps The Simpsons only saving grace is that it can be watched safely with people of all ages (although children don't understand any of the jokes, I know this from watching it years ago as a child myself).Anyway, The Simpsons is dead. Talking about beating a dead horse...",NA,"14 April 2002"
"660","The Simpson's is my favorite show. Every time you see an episode again in syndication you see or hear something new.  My favorite Simpson's character is Homer Simpson.  Every season Homer seems to get a little funnier and also finds himself in more wacky adventures.  My favorite episode's are the TreeHouse Of Horror episodes made for Halloween. In case you might have missed it they made an Easter episode a few years back when they were involved in Bible Stories.  The first one was Homer as Adam and Marge as Eve. The second part of the episode had Lisa help Milhouse free the Isrealites from bondage in Egypt. The third part of the episode had Bart playing David to Nelson's Goliath.

My favorite episodes are the Monorail, the loch ness monster one, and the radioactive man episode. Really, I enjoy all of them and almost every episode contains a guest star. Sam Niell- cat burgalor, Helen Hunt- Renee, and of course, they appear as themselves Stephen Hawking, Leonard Nemoy, Mel Gibson etc. 10/10 EASILY Hilarious!!!!!!!!!",NA,"7 June 2002"
"664","The Simpsons are possibly my favorite  TV Show along with Malcolm and Family Guy. It's the only Show of that I can rewach a (good)episode over and over again, without that it loses his magic and humor. What can I say more, this Show is on television since 13 yeras now, I think this means something!The Writers are brilliant the Quotes are so  hilarious:Homer: I'm not normally a religious man, but if you're up there, save me, Superman!Kent Brockman: I've said it before, and I'll say it again: democracy just doesn't work!Homer: To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems.Homer: Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals... except the weasel.The Simpsons are become an important part of the 90's culture.But the problem now, are the new episodes they're just not funny, they are only making fun of other countrys and persons.If the episodes don't get better It should end.",NA,"8 April 2003"
"665","Although some pundits would like you to believe that this WAS a good show, and that at some point it lost its flair, these people could not be more incorrect. The show changed from typical sitcom format with a satirical joke here and there to a complete satire of television, movies, and our very culture. People just cannot accept that a show can be this good for this long. Well, it can be, when the writers are constantly innovating new ways to make us laugh. Those who say the new ones are not funny are either not watching them, or disappointed that the jokes come faster, the editing is MUCH faster, and that it doesn't fit the old standard sit-com format. Those seem to be invalid points, as do the critics who say the creators made Homer too dumb, or too lazy, or blah blah blah. It's a cartoon, ANYTHING is possible. Get over yourselves and enjoy the best show that this generation will ever see in its prime. I hope the show is on for 15 more years, it is still better than anything else on television (including the shows it has inspired, i.e. Family Guy). Incredible voice acting, sharp, witty writing, and willingness to bash anyone has made this show the BEST of all times. Highly recommended to ALL.",NA,"12 January 2005"
"666","This is an absolutely epic show, and I am still watching it for 11 years running. What I love about this show, is that the humor never dies and it's very witty. Some of the greatest things about the Simpsons is that almost every one has guest starred as themselves, or other people, even in the Treehouse of horror segments, and they parody lots of other films and/or TV shows, and the episode ""Jazzy and the Pussycats"", was really funny, because Bart was still drumming, even though Homer and Marge are trying to sleep, and Homer gets out a white noise machine that can make different noises. I also have the Simpsons Movie on DVD which I got for Christmas. I also forgot one more thing, In different episodes, there are songs playing that can suit almost any situation throughout the series, for example, in Bart-Mangled Banner, Dr. Hibbert was determined to give Bart his booster shot, and the song One Way or Another by Melissa Joan Hart was playing in the background.","9","1 January 2012"
"667","Although the quality of the show is not the same as it used to be, the early seasons are among the best that had aired on the TV across all genres, needless to say animation. It also sit comfortably in the center of the all the American made animations, when it comes to the spirit and direction of the show. Animation in my view can be roughly put into two categories, one is associated with Japanese animation, the other is associated with American animation. The difference is obvious on the surface such as style of drawing, but a more subtle yet more important difference is the theme. The Japanese animation tend to be fantasy based and try its best to distant itself from reality, this phenomena rooted in otaku culture, which means the viewers are sick and tired of reality to some degree and just want watch something that is not here not now. While the American animation basically is no different from any real world TV series in themes and story telling, but because the drawing dose not amount to the real thing, this bring a great advantage. Namely a more loosely and more ambiguously defined world can be used to justify much more ridiculousness and randomness in the plot, and because the viewer don't usually associated a poorly drew face to a real person, this can be used to justified the character's more complex behavior and a more flexible personality. This makes the American animation perfectly suitable for portraying society in a certain way, or be critical of something in the pop culture. And basically this is what American animation does, it is used as a self-reflection tool or a way of express certain thoughts on society or life by the writers. Generally I think animation does a better job than the real world TV shows with few exceptions such as ""black mirror"".Simpsons is among the best in this regard and is very moderate in the theme of the story. Some shows tend to reflect on personal growth and development, such as ""Bojack horseman"", some show would discuss personal philosophy on a more grand scale, such as ""rick and morty"". Other shows offers critical view of society such as ""South park"". Simpsons simply does all at the same time, it's critical to society today but not as sharp as ""South park"", it has a underlining tone of ""no matter what we do the society won't change much"", so in its story telling it just paint the whole picture without providing the cause nor the solution, in ""South park"" the cause part is at least provided. On the side of personal philosophy, the starting point of discussion in Simpsons is the relationship between individual and the group whether it's family or the whole society, discussion that focus on personal development is also presented but overall it's not a major topic. Shows like ""Bojack horseman"" or ""rick and morty"" emphasize more on the topic of a abstract person in a abstract environment, the relationship between self and others are somewhat secondary. In other words you can basically start with Simpsons and apply minor change to it and you can get most of the American show with few exception such as ""Adventure time"" which is a fantasy. In no way I'm saying that all the shows are originate from Simpsons, it just happens that Simpsons just sit in the middle of basically everything, and has this ""All in one"" characteristic. You could say it does everything well but is not the best in any given area, to some extend it's true, but bear in mind that none of the creators has this idea of ""do all the things at the same time"" when they start the show, to end up with Simpson, it took true genius, but when you see all the writers that had been working on the show, especially the early season, it won't be a surprise.","10","17 August 2017"
"668","What more can I say? For about ten years nothing before or since could ever equal the quality of a ""Simpsons"" episode. I've known very few people who don't like the Simpsons, and they're not the sort of people I would ever get close to.As of late, though, the quality of the episodes have deteriorated considerably. One friend of mine says all the best Simpsons writers were sent to ""Futurama,"" that's why the writing has gotten awfully shoddy. I say, bring them back!! Or if not, then take the show off the air and release each season on a wonderful DVD set. Just don't put out inferior Simpsons episodes anymore, it's a sin to do that to such a great show!","8","20 December 2001"

Definitely the wittiest show on television, (sure Frasier is great, but it only works on so many levels.  Simpsons have so many different levels of humor that it's almost impossible to not laugh at least once an episode.) it completely embraces American culture and defaces it at the same time.

Me and my sister laughed for 5 minutes straight a the fact that he said ""underpantsy""! I am like lisa except I have friends. My favorite Character is Bart",NA,"18 October 1999"
"672","The Simpsons is definitely the best cartoon in the history of television in the United States.  No other show has caught my attention as much as The Simpsons have.  I just love The Simpsons.  It cracks me up!!  I first started watching The Simpsons at the age of seven in my native country, Honduras.  We used to have cable where I lived so I was able to watch The Simpsons through a Mexican channel, in Spanish, of course.  Since the first time I stated watching it, I keep watching it till today.  I've been watching a lot of cartoons since I was a little boy.  I used to watch The Flinstones, Tom and Jerry, Scooby Doo, The Jetsons, Tiny Toons, and Looney Tunes cartoons.  I loved those cartoons once... but they start not being that entertaining so I stop watching them.  Sometimes I watch those cartoons but just... sometimes, while surfing the channels. The only cartoon that has never look boring for me, not even through the years, is The Simpsons.  I still watch other cartoons, like Pinky and the Brain, but The Simpsons has no competition.  The Simpsons is so funny that even grown-ups love it. Homer J. Simpson is my favorite character.  I always say something about Homer: many people think he's dumb, but he can't be.  Otherwise, how in the heaven's sake would he be able to learn his lines.  Homer's IQ is 190.  I just love Homer for his jokes, attitude, personality, and for being the funniest man alive.  Bart has to be my second favorite character.  Then Lisa because of her intelligence. And of course, the rest of the characters are super funny, too.  Chief Wiggun, Moe, Pricipal Skinner, Ned Flanders, Krusty the Clown are favorites too.  The gaynest of Mr. Smithers and the evilness of Mr. Burns are good supporting actors.  Every character in The Simpsons has a story to tell.  The show wouldn't be better if one character is remove.  One of my favorite voices is Phil Hartman's for Leo Huntz and Troy McClure. I don't really have a favorite episode because most of them are excellent and all of them are good.  However, I have favorite parts from the episodes. Like when Homer sold his soul to Flanders the devil for a doughnut and the court decided that Homer's soul belongs to Marge so the devil didn't have other option then letting Homer's soul free, but not before saying that Homer would live with that doughnut in his head forever.  In the next scene Homer is eating his headed-doughnut and Marge says, ""Homer! Stop eating yourself.""  ""But I taste so good, Marge,"" he answers. I hope to see The Simpsons around for more years.  And I hope The Simpsons is getting prepared to bring up a good episode to welcome the new millennium.  It will have to do with Y2K.  The Simpsons cannot be cancelled before they reach their 300th episode.  AMERICA DEPENDS ON THE SIMPSONS!!! Matt Groening created the best show so although his hands must hurt he must keep drawing. I have seen Futurama.  It's somehow Simpsons-copied, but it's not as good as The Simpsons.  THE SIMPSONS RULES!  ""THE SIMPSONS ON TV FOREVER!!""THE BEST SHOW EVER!!!",NA,"23 June 1999"
"673","This is, BY FAR the best TV show of all time.  I'm a junior in high school, and yet i still watch it religiously, as well as pretty much everyone else in my school.  There is no substitute for odd humor, pure stupidity and getting drunk at Moe's every night.In my opinion, the Simpsons is THE BEST.  I just can't wait for the movie",NA,"26 July 1999"
"674","The Simpsons is the greatest and probably most original comedy of the 1990s, maybe even the twentieth century. Its greatest strength is in fact its originality. At the best of times The Simpsons is actually very unrealistic, but the fact that it is a cartoon allows it to get away with this. At the same time though, The Simpsons is much more like a real-life sitcom than a typical cartoon program, and therefore cannot really be categorised as just a cartoon.The first few seasons saw The Simpsons develop slowly and the characters all started to grow. In order my top Simpsons characters are:- 1 - Homer Simpson, the king. The most influential cartoon character of all time (Dad, you're a very old man and old people are useless) 2 - Grampa Simpson, whiny and annoying, but extremely funny (Just eat the damn orange!) 3 - Bart Simpson, originally the main star, bad boy but a good heart ( 4 - Chief Wiggum, makes Homer look intelligent and thin (Bake him away toys) 5 - Lionel Hutz, the worst lawyer ever but very affordable (I move for a bad court thingy) 6 - Moe Szyslak, Homer's best ""friend"" (Pipe down rubadub) 7 - Hans Moleman, (oh no, my brain) others- C.M. Burns, Principal Skinner, Dr Nick Riviera, Apu, Krusty the Klown.Even the worst episodes of The Simpsons aren't all that bad, and the fact that it is a cartoon means longevity is not necessarily a hindrance, i.e. the young characters do not grow old or change. The cast is only about 14, yet there are well over 50 characters in the show.Funny and clever, and most of all original, The Simpsons is the pioneer of a whole new genre of television, with shows like South Park and Duck Man following suit. Although South Park has developed a large cult following, it is still leaps and bounds behind The Simpsons.The last couple of seasons of The Simpsons have seen a slight decline in quality, yet I don't really see this as a major problem. The show has already ran for over a decade, and given its nature and the fact that storylines for such a program are not as complicated and hard to find as some, I can see this magnificent program running for another three or four years at least.",NA,"9 September 1999"
"675","It's hard to say something about The Simpsons that hasn't already been said but I'll try it. This show is truly enjoyable for various reasons. It has excellent humor, a large supporting cast, and a small milleu called Springfield of unknown location.The show of course centers around an All-American blue-collar family who have a penchant for fun adventures. Homer is the usual patriarch who wants to be a good father but obviously isn't the smartest person in town. Marge is his loving wife who desperately needs a job (in my opinion), but she's okay. Bart is the adventurer and a budding comdian while his sister is the super-smart middle child who gives a cow a little too much (see ""Lisa the Vegetarian"" and ""E-I-E-I-D'oh!""). Maggie is the third child but she doesn't count because she rarely does anything interesting.Other interesting characters include the strongly Christian Ned Flanders, Comic Book Guy, Chief Wiggum, and Principal Seymour Skinner. I've noticed that most of the characters are male however but at least there's some ethnic diversity. Some of the jokes go may go over the younger viewers' heads but I think the writers do a very good job.My personal favorite was ""The Springfield Files"", where in Mulder and Scully investigate Homer's claim of seeing an alien who appears only on Fridays. The alien actually turns out to be Mr. Burns but it was pretty funny.",NA,"8 September 2001"
"676","This is the first animated primetime show since the Flintstones. The humor and jokes are clever. Great voice acting. The characters are so memorable. Homer Is an amazing character icon. Bart is also a character icon. There both my favorite. Marge is a trusting wife and caring mother. Maggie is the cutest baby. Lisa was great until season 7. Others include Ned flanders
krusty millhouse ralph barney carl lenny wiggum moe mr burns smithers apu patty selma granpa skinners and nelson. Each of the simpsons has a personality like Homer is the dimwited but loving dad. Marge is the strict but loving mother. Bart is the troublemaking son. Lisa is the brains of the family. Maggie is slient but smarter than anyone even lisa. Great fluid animation. So much characters. Hillarous gags like the couch gags itchy and scrathy and of course doh. Memeroable theme music. Well written episodes and funny too. Tons of great morals. The episodes where they travel are adventureous. Loads of funny moments silly couch gags great stories and pop culture reference like tom and jerry looney tunes dr suess south park scooby doo spongebob micheal jackson marvel disney nintendo and the beatles. The treehouse of horror episodes are scary but funny and unforgetable at the same time. Great facts about real life events and famous celebrity guest stars like micheal jackson alec baldwin ringo star and more. But the show went downhill in 1999 because its been going on forever but though there still tons of good episodes. Season 1 had ugly animation because of ugly character designs washed out colors and errors. Plus it is a little boring comparred to the other seasons. Season 9 was great but bad episodes like the principal and the pauper. There a ton of bad episodes. Some humor can be unfunny mostly for the gross outs. So 10 stars.","10","14 February 2022"

"678","The Simpsons are without a doubt the greatest television program ever. They hire the best writers, and get celebrities doing all kinds of things that would otherwise being disregarding. Only an animated series is able to form a cast of characters into the hundreds, and still remember them all fondly.I'll admit, the series in all kind of took a dive around Season 8, considering it's hard to do 300+ episodes without recycling some formats. But it's clearly still the best in the market. Many sitcoms and comedies use tiredless old routines, from the heyday of vaudeville and early 'I Love Lucy' era of Television. That's all fine and dandy, however rather than pay homage to those acts, they try to pass it off as new and exciting to young viewers. But 'The Simpsons', no matter how unsensical, or mundane, is always on the top of their game.'The Simpsons' essentially in roots has basic stock characters. Homer, the patriarch, is dumb, bald, fat, stubborn, and kind of (very kind of) strange. Marge, the wife, is a worrier, and has the typical transgressions with her husband. Bartholomew, is the troublemaker. Lisa, is the brainy loner one, and Maggie is a baby, she holds no significant value.But what makes 'The Simpsons' so great is the way Matt Groening envisioned them, and the writers for 14+ seasons have molded them. With top-notch voicing talents (Dan Castellaneta as Homer is the gem), Only a show like this can make a baby who was voiced by Elizabeth Taylor, shoot a wealthy businessman, and still make complete sense.It's the eye of a true Hollywood story. Writing is the key to success. It started out as a simple one minute sketch filler about another typically-dysfunctional family, and evovled into the greatest Television program ever. Many shows have tried to capture it's charms, and many have failed. 'The Simpsons' are to the 1990's as 'Lucy' was to the 1950's.Don't Have A Cow, Man...",NA,"3 June 2003"
"679","I love the Simpsons. Well, not all of the episodes are great, but all the early seasons more than make up for the new episodes, which have become rather stale. Pretty much everything started going downhill a couple of seasons ago, starting with the episode where Homer takes over the church. It was stupid, and very different to what the show used to be about, classic comical gags and witty lines and political satire in it's subtlest form.But now we have obvious references to current events (though strangely, I never saw an episode where the whole Iraq war was even mentioned, strange considering the show used to point out and make fun of the political incorrectness.) and we have stories that jump all over the place, and it's hard to follow because the writing is so boring. It seems to me that as the animation became easier to do, more episodes were churned out quicker than before, without the care that went into the old episodes.But, watching Krusty shooting Luke Perry out of a canon straight into a brick wall in 'Krusty gets Kancelled', along with all the many classic lines and episodes, more than makes up for these new episodes, which have prompted many people like me to wonder if it is finally time to let the series end and retain it's magic from the classics, before the writers end up making a huge mistake and breaking all the fans hearts by creating episodes so bad even the most hardcore Simpson's fan would cry.",NA,"30 May 2005"
"680","Before Iwrote this comment on The Simpsons, I looked at the other users comments and about 99% of the comments were possitive about the show.I just have one thing to say about those comments, ARE THESE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR MINDS!!!!!.Are these people blind.The Simpsons is a terrible show!All the comments about The Simpsons are like, best show in history or #1 show in the world.Hello, reality check, welcome to the 21st century people, cause The Simpsons is the ABSOLUTE WOREST SHOW IN THE ENTIRE WORLD, HISTORY, GALAXY AAND UNIVERSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",NA,"1 June 2003"
"681","The Simpsons has done something that no show had done before it and no show has done since. Made the audience look at every single character, no matter if they are a main character or a supporting character or even a one-off character, and say ""Gee, I can relate to that character"" or ""Wow, that is so true"". The Simpsons, which is no doubt the most groundbreaking animated series in the history of television, has, over more than 20 years, created characters that have been slowly and gradually etched out and refined, until the ending result has been reached: An amazingly satirical cast of characters. From Cletus, Springfield's resident hillbilly, to Chief Clancy Wiggum, the incompetent police chief, Groening and his team have covered every aspect of modern America's social spectrum. The writing crew has also been a force to be reckoned with. Conan O'Brien, John Swartzwelder, Groening himself and Matt Selman are just some of the always changing writing team which have provided innovative ideas to keep the audience engaged for over 500 episodes. The voice cast are awesomely versatile; there are under 10 principal voice actors who provide the voice behind Springfield's many residents. The only reason I have docked a mark here is because of the newer episodes. It would perhaps be a little unreasonable to think that every single episode has been an absolute classic and the shows quality has declined over the years.In conclusion, if you do not watch this show, please, take the time to watch some of it. If you are thinking of buying a DVD, I recommend any of seasons 2-12. My personal favourites, however, are seasons 7 and 8. Happy watching.","9","24 April 2012"
"682","The Simpsons is one of my favorite shows. I try, if able, to watch AT LEAST one episode a night, and catch the Sunday ""new release."" My favorite episode, however, is the one where John Waters guests stars. That, or the one where Homer has a chili pepper from an insane asylum somewhere in Mexico.I also like just about any episode with Cletus. I swear, that show gets away with the most amazing things-- because it's humour, a cartoon, and run (sometimes) on Fox.It's funny, I love The Simpsons, but am kind of opposed to the News Corporation-- Rupert Murdoch's conglomerate that owns Fox, FoxNews, ESPN, etc. It is just too Republican for my tastes.",NA,"9 March 2006"
"683","The Simpsons was once a classic but is now a shadow and parody of itself. The first blow to show came in the transition from season 3 to season 4 when the true creators of the show, Matt Groening, Sam Simon and Jim Brooks, retired from being show-runners. Whenever characters go out of their creator(s)' hands (ex. Ren and Stimpy, the Muppets, Mickey Mouse, etc.), things usually go wrong. Also, Klasky-Csupo's animation on the show was a lot more artistic, beautiful and cinematic than Film-Roman's work on the show. The show didn't turn to crap immediately, but it started to gradually lose its heart and realism and cinematic-ness and storytelling. They made Homer a childish jerk instead of a lovable, good-natured dimwit; they changed Marge from a very realistic and deep character to a parent who tries to be cool and funny but fails; Lisa went from being an innocent, child-like constance to the show to an intolerant ultra-liberal tree-hugging hippie; and poor Bart and Maggie got shoved into the background. Also, Ned Flanders and Rev. Lovejoy became stereotypical right-wing conservative Christians and Moe started to attempt suicide all the time. But there are still good episodes, but season 16 was mostly weak and the only episodes from that season I consider solid are the ones that keep the characters in-character but aren't funny at all. I'm guess I'm still so sore over Futurama's cancellation (and I also am mad that the Simpsons is still the most popular cartoon in the USA while revolutionaries like Ralph Bakshi, Osamu Tezuka and Ub Iwerks are unknown to the common men) that I just don't like the newer Simpsons anymore. Matt Groening, please end the Simpsons, have Fry and Leela get married, and make a new cartoon.",NA,"4 June 2005"

"685","This has been my favorite TV show for years, and I basically live off the two re-runs a night that are shown in my area.  The back ground humor and one-liners will stick with me for a while.  The cast of characters is so strong and memorable that removing anyone can disrupt the show, as seen with Phil Hartman.  His characters added many great plot twists and jokes that I will greatly miss.People who complain about certain characters miss the point of the entire show.  It is a parody of life, and the characters portray what people can be like in life, although in an exaggerated way of course.Speaking of parodies, the thing I think is best about the Simpsons is its sheer audacity in making fun of institutions of society. They never beat around the bush and make up a similar name for whatever they are mocking; they just come out and say it.  One hilarious example of this is in the episode when Bart and Lisa are nominated for ""Who's Who"".  They come right out and  ridicule them without thought of repercussions.Unfortunately, I, in contrast to many other commentors, think the show is on its last legs. Almost none of the episodes in the  last two years are as good as the repeats that I live on.  My friends and I don't even discuss the past week's episode many times because of the lack of Simpsonesque humor. Granted, the show is still pretty funny sometimes, but it does not have that laugh a minute that it had before.  With Groening's new series coming out, ""Futurama"", I think that this American institution of a family will bow out and be replaced by this new series, which, if it is half as good as the Simpsons was in its heyday, will be quite successful.Goodbye, Springfield.",NA,"27 March 1999"
"686","The Simpsons is an animated-comedy success, which has hit our screens since December 1989, appearing first as shorts in 1987 on the Tracey Ullman Show.I am currently on its seventeenth season, and so far I have had an amazing adventure filled with laughs and great experiences!Although, the Simpsons has passed its ""Golden Age"" 25 years ago, it still remains an animated sensation, with people still watching it all over the world!I personally, love this show. Although, I have found since around Season 10 or 11 some episodes have been quite dull and unpredictable, I still love it in its seventeenth season.My favourite episode is ""The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson"" it is a timeless classic, filled with class comedy. Not only that, it is considered to be the last episode of the Golden Age, and it is a great end to it. I also adore it when the Simpsons go on holiday to other places such as Brazil, Hawaii, New York or even London (which is where I am from).My favourite season has to be Season 6, it is filled with many great episodes including: Bart of Darkness, Itchy and Scratchy Land, Treehouse of Horror V, Lisa on Ice, Homer the Great, And Maggie Makes Three, Lisa's Wedding, and the finale two part episode: Who Shot Mr. Burns Part One.Although the animation in some of the earlier seasons is poor, some of it is good as it looks wacky and goofy and that doesn't stop the storyline from being spectacular.I love this show, and I always will.Thank you.","9","20 March 2022"
"687","What can I say.  Having been a fan of The Simpsons since the very beginning, I have to say that there is no greater show.  I have grown up with it.  It started as a 'kid's show' which was alright for me because I was a kid, but it has certainly gone uphill from its humble beginnings.Admittedly, I cringe when I look back at the old episodes, they had poor animation, simple humour and very few supporting characters.  Now the show is more complicated and I have yet to see a single episode that didn't make me laugh out loud.Rating:  11/10",NA,"31 August 1999"
"688","The Simpsons is an excellent comedy. There are a lot of different characters that are all very unique in there way. There just can't be a bigger idiot than Homer Simpson. He does everything on impulse and really is a bid kid. He is not fit to have any responsibility what so ever, but instead he is in charge of safety at a nuclear plant!!Homer's boss Montgomery Burns, who always forgets the name of his most disastrous employee ""Who's that, Smithers?"" ""That's Homer Simpson, sir. He works in sector 7G"" . Waylon Smithers, Burns' assistant and secretly in love with his boss, the very stupid head of police; chief Wiggum, Apu, Grampa, Groundskeeper Willie, the corrupt major Quimby, the Bouvier sisters, Moe, Barney, etc. They're all brilliant!!!","10","28 January 2002"
"689","I'm basically repeating what has already been said countless times, but oh well. :)The show is without a date one of the greatest things to happen to television in recent history, but as of late the series has been on a sort of downhill slide.  You just can't beat the earlier seasons - there was an air of reality mixed in with the comedy.  As an early user review pointed out the characters and plots were more complex and fulfilling in that regard.Fast-forward to today and what you've got is a series that is still good but has descended into slapstick and caricatures. Take for instance Homer - he has always been a dimwit but he always cared about his family and did his best.  Nowadays though the producers just focus on his stupidity for the quick joke and don't really try to go beyond.I'm probably making the show sound worse than it is - it's still a great show, even today, but you can't beat the early seasons.  If there are still people out there who haven't seen it yet, I strongly advise seeing the earlier episodes first, to gain a better appreciation of how great this show is.",NA,"5 January 2001"
"690","This is undoubtedly the best show ever created. I started watching it about 3 years ago, and I couldn't stop laughing. Homer is so stupid yet so funny and he is my favorite character. The jokes are great and they never get to old or boring even if I've seen the episode 10 times. I will watch The Simpsons as long as they're on.",NA,"7 January 2001"
"691","We all know the show has become the very thing it set out to initially mock, but let's focus on season's 3-8. The simpsons is the perfect mix of heart, intelligence, ridiculous humour, pop culture and pure entertainment. Those years of the simpsons were absolute perfect. And let the following years be a lesson to the rest of us that you should quit while you're ahead to keep yourself from falling.","10","17 February 2019"
"692","The Simpsons,a show that will always be remembered as a classic for its wit and biting satire was just that,one of the best creations of human beings.I remembered that every sunday my whole family would sit in front of the tv and laugh at the antics of our favorite family,they were funny and at times touching,leaving some at the brink of tears always wanting more,all of the plots were always original and covered new ground and closed a storyline for example this classic episode.Mother Simpson:Glenn Close gives a wonderful performance as Homers long lost mother who left Abe and Homer to protect them after she was seen by Mr Burns blowing up his lab,the reaction of the simpsons family was convincing and their acceptance was too,the ending was quite emotional and nice closing to the show.Homer 3d:Not an episode but a story in treehouse of horror with Homer trapped in the 3d world it was what every fan wanted to see and I was really satisfied by it and an appearance by Bart.After that new episodes started coming they were still funny but then the new writers came in,Ivy League graduate losers with absolutely no sense of humour,all of the storylines were weak rehases and new characters(the blonde executive)are really annoying,the jokes(boo-yah!)are used in every chance and they are bad ones by the way.The Simpsons are terribly out of character and the original storylines are outlandish(Simpsons go to africa),what Matt Groening said the simpsons wouldnt be,and in the way messing with previous better storylines(The Simpsons return to the farmhouse,according to Days of the jacknapes Krustys carrer wouldve started in 89)and the jokes are telegraphed from a mile(the la di da cop in Pokey Mom)I wouldve cried 4 years ago if The Simpsons were cancelled,now I would be happy.I hope that the old writers returned for The Simpsons movie or the new writers came up with something as good and funny as the behind the laughter episode.",NA,"3 August 2001"
"693","I've been watching The Simpsons over the past 12 years and I still yearn for more like I did all those years ago. I've never thought a show could last this long and still remain entertaining, appealing and well-written.It's true the best episodes of this wonderful show are years behind us (most notably ""Who Shot Mr. Burns"" and ""The city of New York vs. Homer Simpson""). But I still loyally watch this show, even now at its 13th Season.Matt Groening is a brilliant man who managed to create characters I've grown to appreciate and respect. By creating The Simpsons, he started a phenomenon that seriously affected our society.Other two geniuses are James L Brooks and Sam Simon, who alongside Matt Groening, were directly responsible for transforming this animated family into a prime-time half hour television series. They were truly ambitious in attempting to take that step and deserve their applause.Throughout the many years that have passed we've seen many writers and producers pass through The Simpsons, most notably David Mirkin, Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein, Greg Daniels, Mike Reiss, David S Cohen, Mike Scully, Al Jean and George Meyer. They all contributed to keep this show fresh, alive and interesting.David Cohen deserves even more praise, for moving from The Simpsons to Futurama. He and Groening helped create an even better show. It's too bad FOX is pulling the plug on such an outstanding show like Futurama.I was born in Rio de Janeiro and I still live here. Rio is, in my personal opinion, the most beautiful city in the world and I always wanted to watch a Simpsons episode based here. I had the chance to watch ""Blame it on Lisa"". It was exactly what I expected. This episode worked just like any Simpsons episodes that show us famous international cities in a critical point of view. Rio's tourist officials were plain wrong to criticize a simple animated show because it made the city look bad.I won't deny Rio has its share of problems, even for a city as pleasant. Although tourists aren't actually kidnapped by cab drivers or attacked by monkeys, I will admit it's not a perfect city. However, it was wrong to threaten to sue the producers. After all, The Simpsons has always been a more than just a TV show. It's been a weapon of criticism of today's culture and society, targeting the American family, its values and several other similar values throughout the world. If there are viewers who can't comprehend that and can't take a little criticism they should simply change the channel.Putting that polemic discussion aside, I can conclude that watching The Simpsons can be not only an entertaining experience, but an instructive one as well, if the viewer cares to question the aspects of our society. I hope The Simpsons goes on for many years to come.",NA,"16 April 2002"
"694","The Simpsons is the best animated show ever. It is great and hilarious after all these years. I think they might be running out of ideas but from far fetched plots they make fun of sitcoms, thier network and themselves making it O.K. Everything on the show is just laugh out loud funny and so clever. Plus it has such a fan base that it has had over 150 guest voices on during the 13 years. I know people think that the show is getting repetitive and stale but i feel that it is still wonderful and hilarious. Out of all the charactors Homer Simpson is just the best. He has a good joke every second. The simpsons is just of the best shows on TV. I hope it will stay on the air as long as possible.",NA,"20 April 2002"
"695","I remember when I first started watching this show. I grew up with it, it was with me through my entire life and still is today. Not a day goes by when I don't thank the people who make this show for keeping it on so long. Every episode has made me laugh and smile from beginning to end, and that is something that no other TV show has ever made me do.One of the things that makes this show great is that the humor can be enjoyed by the whole family. Each episode is packed with jokes; some wacky, some witty, some dumb, some clever, but in the end there is no doubt that you will be laughing. In some cases you may even be crying, or just smiling. It has been this humor that has kept me attached to this show for the past years, and it is that humor that will keep me from ever letting go. Some people will tell you that this show has gone downhill and that it is terrible. Personally, I don't know what they're talking about. Each episode has jokes and gags that can make anyone laugh. There are new plots every week and that is an amazing feat considering the show has been on for 18 years. Some people don't like the new ones and that's fine, although others are being a bit purist and aren't giving them a chance, but if you are just looking for a good laugh, a fun story, and a pile of great characters, the The Simpsons are the family for you. Like a majority of their viewers, I love this show's past and present, and I will always look with happiness towards it's future.","10","24 September 2006"

"698","The Simpsons did it! It's a joke in a specific South Park episode but it's oh so true; The Simpsons have been pioneers in the animated comedy world for so very long and they continue to be today. People who say that it's gone downhill since season whatever arbitrary season they decide clearly haven't been watching the same show I have! The Treehouse of Horror episodes have gotten funnier and edgier each year, the characters (even random side characters) have continued to develop and grow resulting in some awesome new canon to a show which already has more to it than all 8000 years of Westerosi history, and the parodies of other TV shows/pop culture events and couch gags with guest animators have continued to amaze and showcase the amazing wit and talent that exists within the writer's room of The Simpsons.It has grown with us over the years, evolving and adding more and more to its ever-expanding world. Since I've gotten Disney+ I must have watched every episode now at least 3 or 4 times but there are still new things that I find when I sit down to watch it with my son...and it's a blast being able to share something with him that brought me so much joy and comedy since I was a child myself.Speaking of the comedy, I did not realize just how edgy and biting some of it was until I rewatched old episodes as an adult! Some of the things that Moe and Groundskeeper Willie vocalize are just completely insane, to say nothing of Homer or Marge's hilarious outbursts. And recent episodes have just gotten that delivery and joke format totally down pat. A particularly favorite line that illustrates the genius of The Simpsons was Homer saying to Marge regarding gaslighting, ""yeah, you've always said that Marge. Remember? Remember?!"" It can be satire at its absolute finest...and also as slapstick, sarcastic, dark, or silly as possible all in any given episode. The fact that after 30 years, this show is not only still going strong but still drawing in new generations of viewers who get to experience the evolution of the comedy is such an amazing accomplishment. I hope The Simpsons goes on forever; with such a rich, dense universe in which anything goes and the impossible is only improbable, it's no wonder it still attracts so many smart and famous guest stars and fans. Any show that gets Stephen Hawking rapping with Flight of the Conchords will win my loyalty and affection any day of the week!Which leads me to the music of The Simpsons, an oft overlooked achievement of the show but one that delights and entertains in an ever evolving way, helping to keep the show feeling fresh and memorable. Whether it's classics like the Maison Derriere song or Lisa It's Your Birthday to the newer, aforementioned Flight of the Conchords/Stephen Hawking mashup, Weird Al's many appearances, or The Great Phatsby, this writers and guests collaborate to make tunes that are impossible to dislike and stay with you long after the episode has ended.Truly, it is amazing what The Simpsons has accomplished in it's 32 seasons on the air; it still delivers fresh stories, beautiful animation and music, and absolutely hilarious jokes that you can watch with the whole family. There's so many shows that have followed in the footsteps laid down by The Simpsons and found success and it's no wonder when the source they've chosen to emulate has such brilliant writers that manage to keep the show from feeling stale even when some of episodes are definitely formulaic (and when the show goes meta and jokes about that very fact, it just makes things even funnier). It will be a sad day when The Simpsons finally hits its end but until then, my family will continue to be avid fans of America's #1 animated family and hope that it goes on for much, much longer!And if you don't like it, well don't blame me, I voted for Kodos <U+0001F609>","10","28 June 2021"
"699","** Possible spoilers** the things the characters do are inappropriate and not Christian like. That's so immature. For on thing, it involves alcohol (Homer), skipping school (Bart), and crimes. It's like watching a PG-13 movie. There's nothing wrong with Flanders, Lisa, and Maggie but Marge is weird. The whole plot is the opposite of Veggietales. Matt Groening has gone to far with w it. When I first saw the show, I didn't know what to expect. I gave it a try. I started to like because it's funny seeing Homer strangle Bart, but inappropriate and being stupid. My rating for the show is ***1/2 out of ***** (3/5)for its immaturity",NA,"17 August 2004"
"700","The Simpsons are one of the greatest pioneers of all time, without them cartoons would still be aimed JUST for kids. Without Homer and the gang there would be no South Park, Family Guy, P.Js etc. I love the Simpsons, it is by far the funniest show ever, and the list characters are great. Bart, who was the first to make headlines, is a perfect stereotype for pre-teens. He personifies the average youth, rambuctious yet has morals. Marge is the the housewife who holds the family together and Lisa is the brainy sister that thinks she knows everything about the world. Mr. Burns is hilarious, as he mimics Darth Vader with his ominous presence and maniacal thinking. I love how he can never remember Homer's name. Speaking of the king, Homer is by far the most influential sitcom character ever. He created DOH! and Mmmmm...; and even though he isn't the smartest guy he is a perfect role model for all dads. No matter how confused he is, Homer always tries his best to help his family. Unfortunately that can't be said for all fathers. I do agree that the Simpson's better years are behind them however after ten years no comedy can keep up its sharp as a knife wit and gut busting jokes. Also with the death of the great Phil Hartman many of the characters have been wiped out. I long to laugh at the crazy antics of Lionel Hutz, and the over arrogance of Troy McLure. However the Simpsons will always live on in repeats because you can watch the episodes over and over, but the laughs will never die!",NA,"18 July 1999"
"701","I have seen every episode except maybe one or two and they are all great. There is something for everybody when you watch. Weather its Homer's hilarious simple minded laziness, or Bart's one liners you won't stop laughing once it starts.One of the greatest things about every episode is that the begining of the episode has nothing to do what so ever with the ending. One example is in season 12 ""Tennis The Menace"". The episode starts out with grandpa winning a tallent show and his prize is a free autopsy. In the end there is a huge tennis match between Venus Williams, Serena Williams, Andre Agassi, and Pete Sampras. It sounds crazy but its hilarious.In the years the show seems to revolve around Bart whose catch pharses made him a memorable favorite, but now it revolves around Homer and Bart and their individual adventures as well as adventures together. I think this is great because Bart is funny, but Homer is funnier than Bart could ever hope to be.But recently ""The Simpsons"" has become tired, and the quality has dipped. Going from great jokes that make you think or taking a cheap shot at someone with out actually saying anything to cheap laughs. I mean they are great but how much more can be done. Homer has gone into space, Bart was part of a famous boy band, Homer saved Springfield, Lisa was President, and the list keeps going on. They have almost exhausted what they can do with the show.If you love ""The Simpsons"" try watching ""Futurama"" probably the next greatest show next to ""The Simpsons"".",NA,"3 June 2001"

the writers are doing quite well i think, i think the simpsons is still the most refreshing show on TV. i have seen some unfunny episodes from time to time, in fact almost without an exeption, each one of the 15 seasons appear to have one or two unfunny episodes.

"710","The Simpsons, yeah The Simpsons, is the greatest cartoon in history. From the  brain of Matt Groening, it'll never be lower in the ranks than 3. The Simpsons is clearly the best cartoon in the world. Every show is different and they get funnier every time. All the characters are great and ingeniously funny, but the funniest is Homer. His dumbness is a boost for his character. Bart is funny but his acts of childish villany get a bit boring when you watch them over and over. Homer on the other hand allways has something new to make us p*ss our selves laughing with, or something pathetic to cry about like ""He's missing the chili cookoff!!!"" or ""Marge, where's christmas?"" Hopefully The Simpsons will run forever, but if it doesn't, congrats to Matt on a job well done.",NA,"2 June 2002"
"711","Its not even a question the Simpsons is the best tv show of all time. I think it is the best tv show of all time because it had a huge impact on life like Homer D'oh is in the Oxford dictionary. The show has very likeable characters like Homer,Bart,Lisa,Marge,Mr. Burns,Smithers,Kent Brockman,Krusty the Clown,Ned Flanders,Milhouse,Nelson,Jimbo,Kearney,Dolph. Another reason why it is the best tv show of all time is that it does a lot of parodies that are much better than Family Guy. In my opinion I think Family Guy is lazy because the animation is lazy and they just said weird stuff and no plot whatsoever. I get very mad when people say The Simpsons suck don't listen to them because they don't realize that this the best tv show of all time. The Simpsons also has a lot of famous catchphrases like Homer's D'oh and Nelson's Ha-Ha. I don't get people hate on modern Simpsons because people don't realize how good it is.","10","3 December 2019"
"712","rarely has a tv show ever been able to burrow so deeply into our lives, but the simpsons does that.this show is constantly hilarious in both a stupid way and a very intelligent way.springfield is everywhere and nowhere.  the characters are contemptuous, evil, lovable, hilarious, pitiful and identifiable all at the same time.it allows us to sit back and laugh at ourselves, because that's basically who we're watching, yet it always give us a redeeming quality.this show does parody, imitation and innovation brilliantly.
sure, on the outside, i may be over-analyzing, but there's a reason this show is consistently on top of everything else.  it's just that good.  any television show where you can laugh yourself silly and at the same time notice that the ridiculous situations the characters find themselves in are just a little further down the path we're all following...well, that's quite an achievement.favourite episodes include ""tomacco"", ""the thompsons of horror lake"", ""max power"", ""the cat burglar"", ""blisstonia""...and on and on and on...actually, the series is sliding a bit in recent years, but still one of the few things worth watching, so enjoy it while it lasts.",NA,"6 August 2002"
"713","What I observed with The Simpsons is that a person who has yellow skin and four fingers on each hand must be funny,Homer,the brain dead one has a lot of laughs,my favourite character,which is Bart,is hilarious,whatever he does,whether it's good or bad,it's very funny,what I love about the Simpsons,is that being a family's hard work,especially if you have a brain dead man,a nagging woman,a smart girl and a trouble making boy,and of course, a silent baby. I wish luck for The Simpsons in the years to come,maybe it'll make it for 30 years. Overall,this show is very funny in any kind of way,with all the celebrities who guest star on the show,even MJ!

"714","I remember when I started watching Simpsons in England when I was about 8. Even though I had lived in America for the 8 years before that I had never actually seen a single episode. At the beginning I enjoyed it and thought it was kinda cool but then when I was about 13 I started to really watch it week for week and I realized just how great this series is. All of a sudden I was getting the clever references to films or politics that I didn't understand before. And now (with 17) I still enjoy it more than any other series.A lot of people say the the quality declined after season 9. Well I have 4-10 on DVD and think that 10 is still amazing and I haven't seen that many of the newer episodes to comment on them as a whole. The ones I have seen however are without a doubt a lot worse.Maybe South Park and Family Guy are funnier nowadays but I will always see them as Simpson wannabes because the mid-90 episodes will never be beat.","10","2 November 2008"
"715","Here's my brief review of the Simpsons:Seasons 1-6: The finest moments not only in cartoon-sitcom history, but also in Television history. Who can forget the James Bond-esque villain Hank Scorpio(which was my fav. episode), Milhouse being chased by a FBI agent ""The Fugtive"" style, or even one of Homers many misadventures? I will watch these seasons in syndication any time, and I will most likely wear out my DVD player when they come to the DVD format.Seasons 7-current: Since season 7, the show has been going down. I would almost say it's hit rock bottom. The concepts are just not that funny anymore. I mean, c'mon:A judge that binds Homer and Bart together or Krusty losing his daughters violin to the mafia just aren't as funny as they should be. It's almost as if Matt Greoning has stopped trying with theis show. If The Simpsons doesn't pick up the pace, it'll go out with barely a whimper when the time comes.(Which should've been 5 years ago.)",NA,"28 July 2003"

"717","I chuckle when, every once and a while, I meet a person who for their own (twisted) personal reasons, is not fond of The Simpsons. Yes, for those who aren't too knowledgeable of American popular culture, many of the jokes are a dead-end and not funny. But still, you have the visual gags and wildly strange-looking characters and animation; though by far the cleverest jokes are the witty ones, not just what you see. Being young doesn't help, either - how are you going to laugh when Moe mentions the movie ""Mistery,"" and you only have the vaguest clue who Kathy Bates is and you've never even seen the movie? But even when I watched this show as a child, I could appreciate the humour, even if not at all levels. The Simpsons - are America. Every horrible stereotype, every truthful fact, and every weird person, place or thing is summed up onto one show that has been bound, since its beginnings, to make fun of it all. If the show had a motto (excluding ""D'oh""), it might be ""We don't discriminate - we make fun of everyone, equally."" And it's the honest-to-god truth. Still don't like it? Hell, maybe you're not clever enough to like it. Maybe you don't have an open mind. Who knows? Sure, after SO MANY years (are we talking fifteen already?) sometimes the show can be hard-pressed for laughs. But just as I think the average yellow American family may be losing its style, something pops up on the boob tube that has me laughing hysterically. If you don't have a taste for satire, maybe you wouldn't get me. But if you understand that the heart of The Simpsons in the American culture itself, and we really can be that dumb, or slow, or funny, or strange - then The Simpsons will live forever. Maybe they won't make a feature film - I'd like one, but I also don't want the disappointment (do we remember ""Star Trek"" the Movie? If so, than you know what I mean). Maybe it will go off the air in a week. But still, this show deserves the greatest respect for what it is, not because of what people think it tries to be.",NA,"1 May 2004"

I've been watching it for so long, probably since i was 4-5, and the old seasons had some hilarious episodes. It's just that, I don't find it as appealing or even as good as people make it out to be. I don't know what it is. I enjoy the show but I can't get attached to it like I am with a lot of shows. It's like there's something stopping me from being obsessed with the show but is that it?I will never be mad about this show no matter how good, classic or ""original"" it is. I've always preferred Family Guy for a certain reason anyway. But just because it's not as appealing to me doesn't mean I'll hate on it.

"722","Though strictly about a compilation video, this seems to be the forum to add my views on The Simpsons.England has always been behind America where US TV shows are concerned (though this is usually a very good thing).  I believe, on terrestrial TV here, we are currently a year behind the US schedule, but I can already concur with what I have read from a great many other Simpsons Fans.The Simpsons, once the pinnacle of satire and slapstick, has definitely taken a nose-dive.  It still scores over everything else that American TV has to offer, but in the latter series' I have actually (please forgive me) been relieved to get Homer off the screen for a few seconds.  He is undeniably the best developed character in a sitcom (simplistic but extremely well rounded) and because of this it is so apparent when he steps out of persona to follow an ""adventure"" plot-line.  Because the majority of the shows are now driven by Homer, his personality (usually a constant to monitor the madness around him) is becoming warped and pulled out of shape by the demands to have ""All Homer Episodes"".In actual fact, some of my favourite episodes have concerned other people - Primarily, it must be said, Montgomery Burns - An inspired comedy creation.What will happen to the Simpsons?  Everyone has some point to conjecture, but the facts are that it has now overtaken The Flintstones as the longest running TV cartoon and unless Dan Castellano outprices himself from the series, it should continue into the future.  One by one we will stop watching it, and in the days to come of 'Futurama' the Simpsons will be showing on Channel 57 in the middle of the night watched only by the unemployed and alcoholic.But hey, that accounts for me, see you there!",NA,"2 July 1999"
"723","""HOMER HOMER HOMER HOMER"" This is by far the best cartoon comedy ever. It all has to do with Homer he is the star , if it wasn't for his dumb attitude the show would of died years ago,but the show lives on and I think it has a chance to last another 10 years. (not Futurama ) I'll do say one thing is that this is not the way to treat your son.""BART!!!!! WHY YOU LITTLE"" ""agahhahha!""",NA,"5 August 1999"
"724","my gosh, can you find anything funnier in the world than the simpsons. Especially homer, he is the single most funniest character in the world, in just about every episode he comes up with several funny lines that can keep you laughing about it for years to come. I think the series really kicked off after season two with one of best scenes with homer trying to get a letter back from the post office that he wrote to mr burns (homers boss, also a very funny character)that wasn't exactly ""nice"". Even though i was just 6 when i first saw the simpsons it was funny, and now that i'm older i get all the good jokes i used to never get. If you watch the older episodes that you've already seen thay will get even funnier and funnier, you'll pick up stuff you didn't notice before. If you don't like the simpsons you're crazy. I mean it you're crazy. I think it is the funniest most entertaining show ever to hit the small screen and i hope they do make a motion picture for the big screen.",NA,"10 August 2000"

I hear people saying that they have been on for to long but if you were watching the simpsons as long as I have you know that the simpsons today is much different then the simpsons in the beginning or the simpsons back in the 4th season so when you think about it old simpsons were canceled and came in with a new version (just a thought). and also next season the simpsons will be having their 300th episode.","10","15 May 2002"
"729","""The Simpson's"" is the best cartoon series ever made. It was grate the first seven years (1989-96) but then it is - I'm sorry to say - just garbage. Well, you can't expect Matt Groeing and he's team-mates to role on forever. The geniality in the episodes disappeared about -97.

"730","This is one of most favorite cartoons on TV today. I'm the type that loves horror, comedy and stuff like that. But when it comes to cartoons this is the best. In a way its a family cartoon, but than you got episodes that are for the teenage and adult years. Every October is my favorite time of the year with the Treehouse of Horrors episodes. Every November the Thanksgiving episodes and so on. Homer is stupid and makes you laugh because of it....DOH! Marge is the moralistic mother, who is also a time bomb waiting to happen......MMMMmmm. Lisa is the brainy sister who seems to be the only one who understands anything. Maggie has gone 12 years of sucking a pasifire, yet she is probably smarter than everyone else. Bart is the man! The rest of th characters are great too.Now that the seasons have come out I am hoping the episodes will be uncut and have the deleted scenes in them. But this is for the writers, animators and others involved......Let them grow up maybe they can be as funny as adults. I mean how long can you keep Bart and Lisa in the 5th grade? How long will Maggie have that pasifire.",NA,"25 February 2003"

"732","this was probably the greatest show in america, however over here in Europe we have realised that this show has longed since peaked.  I love the show but only the older eposides and it is embarrassing to watch the latest episodes on sky one due to the episodes having weird storylines such as, Bart divorcing his parents?, also in an episode where Bart has to spend time in a balloon? Homer actually being a genius? also I think the characters have changed for probably the worse, for example in the mordern episodes Lisa is becoming too arrogant which isn't really like the Lisa in the older episodes.  Personally I don't think Homer is funny as he once was with his cracking one liners.  I think the show went down hill when phil hartman died, he played excellent characters such as lionel hutz etc. after reading one particular post i urge the writers to either buck of their ideas and try to restore the show it once was the powerful force or take the show off the air and save it from the ""show that went on too long"" But don't get me wrong, i think the show in general is excellent but the modern episodes have in a way are starting to really ruin the reputation of the show",NA,"6 September 2003"
"733","I remember reading one comment on The Simpsons that kept calling it ""dumb"" and that it ripped off material Family Guy. I wish people would be more specific in describing something as ""dumb"". As for it ripping off Family Guy, that's just silly. The Simpsons began as a revolutionary ""real life"" example of what American families are actually like. I credit The Simpsons with influencing and paving the way for cartoons such as Family Guy and South Park. As to comment on how ""dumb"" The Simpons is I'd like to say that thousands of jokes must have flown right over your head, which cater to the more intellectual demographic. However, I will admit that The Simpsons has gone down hill drastically and I haven't been a fan for many years. I just wanted to comment on what I read; sorry I cannot find the entry to cite the exact person who said it.",NA,"14 December 2004"
"734","Without a doubt, this is the best show ever. While some episodes are bizarre, and some are not funny at all, this show continues to make me laugh. Homer has some the greatest quotes in TV history. After 12 years, the show just keeps on rolling.",NA,"1 September 2003"
"735","What are you some old people who always say ""It was better when i was young"". The series have been better with time, better drawings, jokes etc.The Simpsons 2-14 have been the best of the series. 15 I have not seen yet. 1 is not even close to as funny as the newer seasons, but its still not bad (strange voice on homer, old look). The story line might not bee as good anymore but it still make me laugh.",NA,"23 January 2004"
"736","I understand what Jellyneckr is saying and i agree. ""The Simpsons"" are kind of losing its humor, and they are going downhill but the writers for the show are some of the best writers there are. So even when ""The Simpsons"" are going downhill the writers can still make the show very very very FUNNY! For example, in the recent episode that Marge was telling Bart, Lisa, and Milhouse stories for projects that they had to do since the library had no books, that is a newer episode like i said before and that was absolutly hilarious. I was cracking up. And you said that ""The Simpsons"" is very unfunny anymore that is not true. So I think that ""The Simpsons"" should not be cancelled. Maybe they can just hire all fresh new writers, and keep the old writers. But anyway ""The Simpsons"" should not be cancelled.",NA,"22 February 2004"
"737","The simpsons, by far, has become one of the best television shows of all-time. Not only does it resemble most household American families, but all families around the world. Unlike most cartoons, this isn't one of those off-the-wall shows, defying laws of physics and breaking through temporal barriers. Matt Groening has done a wonderful job of capturing the typical life of a modern family, and turning them into normal people like you, and me.The show has had it's moments, while others could be simply thrown away and fed to the dogs. These are the episodes you may only want to see once. There are some very well written and directed episodes, which goes to show you, that even after fifteen years of The Simpsons, they still have some tricks up their sleeves.",NA,"19 June 2004"

"740","Iconic. No other show quite like it. If I could only take one show to a desert island it would probably be The Simpsons.Writing a review for a show like The Simpsons should be easy, but it's not. So here are the positives by the numbers:#1 The show is an uncontested classic. The longest running US show by far can't be too bad. That many Americans watching that long can't be wrong, esp. Considering how many other shows there are to choose from.#2 Plots contain consistent Christian messages. Despite what so many have said about the Simpsons being a godless show... it actually depicts hardworking God fearing folks and practical Faith without being too on the nose.#3 Episodes were better in the beginning, but are still going strong. Not every episode can be a winner and the ones that are, resemble masterpieces. But they still are only 22 minutes of tv and fit into the same framework as other episodes. But some episodes are rated twice as highly as others. Example: marge v the monorail, Lisa needs braces, homer's enemy.#4 Basic formula has inspired numerous imitation shows. As much as family guy has funny moments it is a parody of a parody. The Simpsons was meant to be a somewhat genuine show depicted a parody of American life, but so many other shows have copied the formula and essentially the animated sitcom genre was started. People only watch those because they first watched The Simpsons.#5 They can't help being somewhat off-putting with the yellow skin. I refused to watch for years simply because the yellow skin was to bizarre. But the animators did that for some reason. Just watch, it's a good show. Don't let the skin tone put you off.Season 4 is wonderful tv from start to finish!","10","26 June 2021"
"741","While the newer season's of simpsons may suck it could'n be less true to the old season's of simpsons meaning around season's 1-8 with 4 being a highnote. I don't know about 9 and 10 since i haven't seen them and what i have seen of the newer season's of simpsons well they are trash but still watch season four if you like it watch's one trough eight and possibly nine and ten and after that watch futurama and read life is hell. We should (and have propably) all watch the simpson's because it's really really good. (not as good futurama tough)","9","27 February 2019"
"742","A GOOD show like SKIN!?!?!?! Disregard that last comment. I'm sick of everyone saying that Family Guy has been dealt this huge injustice by the Simpsons. Look back. There are gags on the Simpsons done YEARS ahead of the Griffins. The Simpson's came before Family Guy, thusly is not a rip off of said show. Few animated shows reach the depth and humour of the Simpsons. Kudos to Matt Groening for letting us all laugh a little more. I've been a fan of the Simpsons since it first came on all those years ago. They've only gotten better with age. Guest Stars and ongoing themes keep it interesting, and besides, you can never get enough of the crantastic! Boo-urns indeed. . .",NA,"15 December 2004"
"743","How can a TV show in this day and age - a cartoon nonetheless - be so wickedly sarcastic, politically taut, culturally accurate, and gut-burstingly humorous?  ""The Simpsons"" accomplishes all of those feats. Despite its mainstream success (although Bartmania faded in the early 90's) it has a strong underground following as well.  My friends and I could probably recite lines from any episode...and frequently do.  The guest stars are great, the writing perfect, and the show outstanding.  I am positive that decades from now, it will be regarded as a cultural marker of what America was like in the days of otherwise mindless programming.",NA,"20 December 1998"
"744","The show is really good. A lot of humor. What I like the most is that it can be watched by little children and adults at the same time. A lot of funny moments. I have watched every single episode some of them more than once and have not came to a bad one. In my country the show is aired on FOX and the allow us to choose the language so that we can understand the funny moments more correct which is nice.","10","26 May 2017"
"745","The Simpsons is superior to any other TV show ever created! It has hysterical comedy yet still remains realistic, except for brief moments in certain episodes. I am 13 yrs. old now and have been watching The Simpsons since I was 5. That's 8 yrs. I've seen at least 280 episodes out of the current 3**. I own seasons 1,2,3,4, and 5 on DVD at the current time 1-24-05. I recite simpsons quotes all the time. I always say d'oh or woo-hoo! My favorite episode would be... hmmmmmm...uhhhhhhh... I really couldn't tell you what it is because there are so many good ones. The only bad Simpsons episodes are usually the ones that are about Marge or Lisa. Homer and Sideshow Bob (Kelsey Grammar) are my favorite characters. I love when they sing. They made a whole episode of a clip-show of all their singing insanity! So Overall I'd give The Simpsons a 10 thumbs up*.Your Loyal Idiot,Bruno*thats a joke from the episode where homer became a food critic.",NA,"24 January 2005"
"746","I've watched the Simpsons since the Christmas special originally aired in '89. All I can say is what a great show this is. Sure there have been some weak episodes, but for the most part the show still retains the greatness it always had. No other show on TV can even touch it.   Every time it seems that maybe the shows' quality is slipping a little bit, the next episode that follows usually redeems itself. Sometimes the show even mocks itself when the quality slips a little bit. Even a bad episode of The Simpsons is better than most of the other formulaic garbage on TV today.

"748","What can I say? The Simpsons is the best thing ever to hit TV. It is incredible. The comedy is everywhere in every scene and you will pick up new jokes with each viewing like the other day when watching the one where Bart is a daredevil and tries to jump the gorge but Homer does instead - when Homer falls out of the ambulance and goes over the cliff again watch out for Wendell (the boy who always gets sick!) getting sick as he watches Homer fall! They have gone downhill in recent years because the producers have decided to keep getting Homer caught up in silly and implausible situations rather than just dealing with the day to day lives of the characters which is where the shows humour and charm comes from. My favourite episode is the one where Homer goes to Clown College - brilliant!!!!!!!! Apart from Homer my favourite character would have to be Fat Tony",NA,"9 March 2001"
"749","Have to say Simpsons really does suck these days. Can't even bear to watch it anymore. I think series ten is probably the last bearable series.They should have stopped when they were at the top of the game but just went on that too long, similar to friends, (three crappy series at the end)You can tell how desperate the writers have got to get a funny story line with them just coming up with any random plot unlike the earlier episodes.The classic subtlety of the series 3-8 has well and truly gone!",NA,"14 December 2005"
"750","I love this show so dearly. It never fails to make me laugh, warm my heart, or sometimes even, cry. Every episode is either so much fun, or just an overall great experience. The vast number of themes it manages to incoporate are amazing aswell. From Season 1 to 10, it was undoubtedly 11/10 material. However, after Season 10, things.. started to get fishy, least to say. That's the only reason this doesn't have 10/10. Overall though, a truly wonderful experience that I doubt I'll ever forget.","9","1 May 2021"

"752","Sure, the first 10 seasons were the best the show has ever seen, but I wouldn't say that the newer seasons are any worse.

I'm newer to the Simpsons than most (started watching around 2013 ), but the newer seasons don't deserve to be handled like this.","9","19 May 2021"
"753","The Simpsons is by far the best animated comedy series I have ever seen. It is about the Simpsons family of Springfield; however, it is never stated where Springfield is located. Enter the Simpsons family, Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie.Homer Simpson is the basic idea of the American dad: an overweight slob that's a little slow-minded. Homer works at the local power plant and though he is fired several times, he keeps coming back. His catchphrase (""Do'h!"") has even been added to the English dictionary. Homer also loves Duff Beer and is often seen at Moe's Tavern.Marge Simpson is the run-of-the-mill mother. She cooks, she cleans, she runs errands. She loves Homer even with all his faults and she has mothered three children with him. Marge is most famous for her blue hair that's almost as tall as she is.Bart Simpson (mistakenly called ""Brat"" by Homer's boss) is the average ten year old boy. He gets into trouble, and is basically the young version of Homer, except with two alterations: he has hair, which is spiked on top of his square head, and he does not have the same weight issue Homer has. He likes skateboarding and also calls his father Homer instead of Dad, Daddy, or Father.Lisa Simpson is the smartest one in the Simpson family. She is eight and plays the saxophone. She has hair that is spiked like a starfish, and see is amazingly smart for her age. In fact, she even has more wisdom than her ape of a father! She always wears an orange dress along with matching shoes, yet she doesn't really care about her looks (minus the season four episode Lisa the Beauty Queen).And let's not forget Maggie. Maggie is Marge and Homer's youngest child. She is an infant and always has a pacifier in her mouth. She spoke once in the entire series, yet no one heard her, except the show's audience. Maggie wears an over-sized blue garment, which might be what makes her trip and fall flat on her face. Every once in a while, at random times, Maggie makes a sucking noise from having her pacifier in her mouth.While people say that after a few seasons this show got old, I disagree and love it 100%. Let's hope that Matt Groening, Simpson's creator, continues on for a little longer, until everyone on the planet is screaming, ""ENOUGH ALREADY!!""","10","28 May 2009"
"754","It almost seems unnecessary for me to comment on ""The Simpsons,"" considering the tremendous amount of well-deserved praise everyone is giving it, and always has been. It is simply a wonderful show, and even ""Worst Episode Ever,"" (which really was the worst episode ever) was worth watching. You can never tire of ""The Simpsons."" One of the best things about it is how you can watch every episode again and again, and always notice something that you previously missed.The characters on ""The Simpsons"" are such interesting people, and even the smallest characters catch your attention. There aren't enough shows where small, unimportant characters can keep returning when you least expect it. This is a wonderful thing about ""The Simpsons."" There are so many great supporting characters: Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Comic Book Guy, Kent Brockman, Chief Wiggum, Mr. Burns, Smithers, Reverend Lovejoy, Troy McClure, and so many others. The guest stars on ""The Simpsons"" are also hilariously written and voiced.The thing that really makes ""The Simpsons"" an extraordinary show is tremendous amount of wit, sarcasm, jokes, and pop culture references that fill every episode to the top. I recall an episode that was entirely devoted to the short-lived 1967 television series ""The Prisoner."" I felt lucky that I was one of few people that could really understand and find the humor in that episode. That is what makes ""The Simpsons"" the best television show on the air today.",NA,"3 December 2001"
"755","I can understand why people might get tired of it but it's still the funniest show ever and the writers had to put a lot of effort into thinking about 750 episodes and there all great.

I'm only up to season 11 but I know it's still getting better and no hate should come.","9","12 December 2021"
"756","There is so much to be said about The Simpsons that you could fill a book with it.  In fact, they have.  But aside from that fact, I'd have to say that it IS the most intellegent show on TV.  The jokes are aimed towards the things in life that may upset you or make you happy, and the creator, and Genius Matt Groening, shows us how to find a sense of humor in those things. Take the stupid police in Springfield, ""Hey Simpson, don't forget to bring that evidence to court with you or else, we'll have no case, and you'll go off scott free"". I was suprised with the last Halloween episode.  A lot of people have thought that The Simpson have lost something, in all those years, and I'de have to say, that episode proves them wrong. With the release of they're first season, I hope they follow the Sopranos, and release every season.  I'd have to say that the fourth season, or fifth is The Simpson's prime. I have watched this show since I can remember.  ""Release the hounds Smithers"".  I go to the quotes page, and I laugh out loud uncontrolabely at the quotes.  I can't watch an episode of The Simpsons without laughing, and asking the people around me, ""Did you hear that"".  They all look at me like I'm insane but, I still can't get over how funny the joke was until I hear an even funnier joke! This show is for intellegent people who have an understanding of what's going on in the world, and even pokes a few jokes at Stereotypes!  Example the bumblebee man, and Senor Dingdong after he saves the day  he hops in his Chevy van and can't get it started!  Brilliance!  Sheer genius! The Shinning.  Don't you mean the Shining?  As grounds keeper Willy says ""No The Shinning, you want to get sued?"" I would state my favorite episode but there is way too many to remember. I love this show like none other, and I hope it never ends. Sadly........it will.  And then I will be forced to watch crap, or put my DVD player to work!",NA,"15 November 2001"

One might wonder how a show so stupid could be so well-loved, but it is. The plots and characters are absolutely ridiculous, but are lovable all the same. And anyone who's anyone has guest starred, including movie stars, singers, and no less than three former US presidents. The Simpsons have been to almost every continent AND the moon. And they have given us some of TVs most memorable songs, from Mr Burns' 'See My Vest' to the Simpson family's own rendition of 'Under the Sea'.The only bad things I can say about the show is that it has gotten a little racy as it has gotten older, and the Halloween specials are no longer good!",NA,"9 February 2008"

And its not because what makes it the best, nothing. And some people may say because its ""comedy gold"" but its really not. Ok, now im gonna talk about the creators, they are dragging it so bad like oml leave the show alone there should be no reason why this show is still getting new episodes but they end TAWOA, Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, The last man on earth ETC.

"763","I've been watching The Simpsons since it debuted in 1989 when I was 12. Now I'm 25. And I only have one question: How can anyone NOT love this show? It is smart, creative and insightful. Seeing the first season again reminds me how much I love the newest episodes because of the chance to enjoy the development of the characters and style of the show.I've seen quite a few comments on this board about ""why does Fox keep this show on the air?"" I'll tell you: it is the highest ranked Fox show in the Neilsen ratings -- in it's 14th season!! Why would they cancel their highest rated show?! And why is it still pulling in the ratings? Because it is still hilarious. Not every episode makes every person laugh, but that's because the content of the show is so varied. And I find that over time an episode that you may not have originally liked begins to grow on you.
But on average, this show has more silly, harmless fun than anything else I've seen. It keeps you laughing and can make you think. Well worth watching.",NA,"20 November 2002"
"764","Personally, I believe The Simpsons, created by Matt Groening, is the best animation that's been going on for 19 years. I love the characters (including Bart, Homer, Marge, Maggie, Snake, Abe and way more...) and they all have something cool about them. I have a series of favourite episodes, but I especially like every Treehouse of Horror episode. The one that spoofs The Shining is very intelligent, and I laughed through the whole thing.No wonder The Simpsons has been nominated for a Golden Globe, had another 98 wins and 103 nominations because it is so good.

"765","The simpsons always has had odd plots, like homer falling into the digital vortex (o.k thats a halloween episode and doesn't count, but) Although not as funny as Malcom in The Middle (best part of Frankie Muniz's carrer worst was my dog skip) the one problem I have is that they always revert back to the beginning and only keep the big plot changes in the episodes *cough*maud*cough* I still love it though. Anyway back to the title of this review Odd episodes, I think most of the episodes are very, very, very wierd. In the beggining it was stuff like homer contemplating suicide, then a year or two later, the oddness level goes up with the simpsons caring for an albanian spy, and the its almost off the meter with aliens wanting to destroy earth(that normally only comes up in the halloween episodes) see what I mean. But I LOVE ODD SCRIPTS!!!! and i hope the simpsons will keep going after 2005",NA,"22 February 2003"
"766","Being 17 years old, and having grown up watching the Simpsons, it sort of breaks my heart to read these constant Simpsons bashing threads. I'll be the 1st to admit, the show is not nearly what it used to be. The Simpsons lost something a long time ago, an element I cannot exactly pin-point. Watching recent episodes, and thinking back to the ones I grew up loving (Timmy O'Toole, Homer in love w/ Mindy Simmons, The monorail, Kamp Krusty, just to name a few) its seems like 2 diffrent shows to me. Even though the new ones are still funny, I dont like them nearly as much as the ones made in The Simpsons's heyday (probably 90'-98', or something).In my opinion, Simpsons fans have every right in the world to be upset w/ recent episodes, but should also keep in mind how great the show USED to be. The Simpsons was a ground breaking show that pushed the limits of what was acceptable on TV at the time. The show itself was a pop culture icon, and was consided quite edgie(even though such shows as Family guy, or South park now make those ground breaking shows look like the smurffs). Even though I was very young, I still remember schools across the country banning simpsons shirts.The Simpsons is (to me) like an old family dog. Sure, its not as fun as it used to be, and may be a bit stale, but that doesnt mean you should go tie him to a tree and shoot him. The Simpsons deserves respect for being the great show that it used to be. If you dont like the new episodes, dont watch them.  Remember The Simpsons , not as the show that YOU outgrew, but the show that may have outgrown YOU.",NA,"7 March 2004"
"767","The Simpson's is an amazing show that's been on the air for 18 seasons. It appeals to all audiences even young children, with things like Bart and Homer's remarks and itchy and scratchy, thou they will definitely not understand all the jokes. Thou it is slipping in quality 8 out of ten episodes you will finish watching with a dam good taste in your mouth and will definitely have a quite a few laughs. If you have been a fan of this show since that December day way back in 1989 then you will stand by it after its bad episodes and after its good episodes you will say this show is amazing. Anyway the show is about your average family yada yada yada. The characters are dumb ten year old big brother Bart, 30 something father homer , thirty something mother Marge, middle child Lisa(age 8) and of course baby Maggie( about 8 months) and their neighbors in their town of Springfield. The day this show ends will be a sad day for everyone fortunately this amazing show is singed up to 2010 for the time being and reportedly contracted for three movies( the first one is guaranteed to come out this summer on July 27) who do I recommend this show to everyone whether your looking for a laugh after a bad day at work or school or just looking to kill a half hour with good entertainment this show is where to go.",NA,"10 March 2007"
"768","This show started off being funny, but now it is amazing. The way they've moved it on from a childrens show, using Bart as a typical cliche boy, to a hugely funny show that many adults enjoy is fasinating. Bart has matured so much and so has Homer whilst Lisa and Bart now often join forces making the so much more unique and leading to much funnier situations. Homer is now not simply a stupid, fat, middle-aged man but a person that everyone can relate to and laugh at aswell as empathising with. Sure not everyone is fat and Lazy but there is something about him that makes everyone love him. The shows to are so much better now, funnier, more mature and well just so much better it's hard to describe! When an ""old one"" is on Tv me and my sister spend the whole thing thinking how much it has improved, everything from the voices, to the charctors, to the story lines and to the jokes is so much better now and I can't see how anyone could dissagree with this show being absolutely amazing.",NA,"27 March 2004"
"769","Over 24 years of air-time and more than 500 episodes. The feat this show has achieved is unmatched. The Simpsons is the longest running animated TV show and longest running prime time TV show. It has won 115 awards and been nominated for a further 150. The show has received so much praise, being named as the greatest TV show ever. The influence this has had on other TV programmes has been incredible. Animated shows once considered dead was single handedly revived by The Simpsons. Its unmatched success also carved a niche for adult ""cartoons"", leading to other great shows such as South Park, Futurama (created by Simpsons creator Matt Groening) and Family Guy.I began to fully watch The Simpsons 5 years ago and i have seen every single episode, most of them probably two or three times. I watched it a few times as a kid, many years ago, and played several games but never understood the sheer genius of the show, until one day i flicked through the channels and Bart the Daredevil was on, seeing Homer fall down the ravine twice, i laughed so hard and was instantly hooked to watch another episode. The Simpsons also generated my interest in animated programming, which is literally all i watch today and i'm currently studying.The are so many reasons to watch The Simpsons, wacko larger than life characters, the pop culture references to everything including music, books, TV shows and mostly films. The parodying of nearly everything. So many celebrities have made an appearance or given their voice, which gives it the record for the most guest appearances. There are hidden references and messages in every episode, some that may be only be seen after watching one episode 5 times. Every character has a gag, a catchphrase and a background story, which many shows and animated programs do not. In each season there's a clip show special, three part anthology episode and of course the great Treehouse of Horror series, which has influenced many other shows to make their own anthology specials. Having been running for 24 years straight you would expect that there would be a decline in quality, which many people have criticized. Fans have been noting that there's been a decline in humor since season 9/10. I think it started when Seymour Skinner was shown to be a fake. Many fans have abandoned the show since the early 2000's. Being a long time fan i think it was still funny until mid season 22 but since the end of season 23 the show has begun a sharp rise again in humor, writing quality and touching moments that have not been seen since the earlier seasons.Main Characters include: Homer - the father of The Simpsons, the most beloved TV character, is the overweight lazy slob meant to represent the average labour worker in America. He is known to say D'0h, (which even made it into the English dictionary), after doing something stupid which he is always doing.Marge - the housewife who keeps the family together, usually supported by Lisa in stopping Homer and Bart in their crazy schemes, which can be annoying at times. She represents the typical American mother and wife. Her laugh is her so funny and annoying. Bart - Originally the Simpsons was all about Bart in the first few seasons, but Homer became more popular and more episodes began to feature about him. However Bartmania still rules. A notorious prankster, who's doing all sorts of crazy stuff, Bart is an extremely fun character that any kid can relate to. Bart has so many catchphrases such ""Ay Caramba"", which also made it in the dictionary, ""Eat my shorts"", ""I'm Bart Simpson who the hell are you"". Bart's recurring gag is causing trouble for Homer and prank calling Moe in the early seasons.Lisa - An 8 year old highly intelligent kid, who loves to play the saxophone, is always rebelling against the town. She is also convert to Buddhism despite only being 8. In the early seasons she was more fun character, supporting Bart in his pranks but sadly over time she has become serious, unpopular and in my opinion extremely annoying and selfish. Maggie Simpson - Don't let the child fool you. Famous for shooting Mr Burns, she has also saved homer's life on more than one occasion.There are so many more great characters that started as background/supporting characters, who have gone on to become major characters, some even having the whole episode devout to them such as Willie, Chief Wiggum, Mr Burns, Nelson and Ned Flanders.The Simpsons is no longer a cartoon it's a philosophy - BBC.","10","9 October 2012"

"773","Last week on the Simpsons (4/9/06) in the episode ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bangalore"", Patty and Selma were showing Richard Dean Anderson slides of their vacation in an attempt to get him to leave them alone. While Anderson is running in front of patty, her eyes are seen through his body. I guess they forgot to erase her eyes and it appears that Andersen is transparent. I was quite shocked to see this actually. When I watched the episode the first time something seemed off but I couldn't figure out what. After watching it a few more times in normal speed, I slowed it down a bit and saw the error. It was pretty cool actually :D Did anybody else notice this?~Kolohe",NA,"17 April 2006"

"775","Every once and a while, a brilliant and trancendant show comes along, something that puts all of the prosaic and painfully ordinary claptrap in its place, and more often than not, shows like that are cancelled. I know what I'm talking about here, I had to sit by and watch 'Action,' one of the best new shows of the past 5 years, get cancelled while the over-rated and preachy 'Will & Grace' was allowed to survive. 'The Critic' died fast, and I had to watch my beloved 'Sliders' deteriorate into second rate abysmal junk after 3 seasons. This brings us to 'The Simpsons,' a smart and insightful show that was somehow allowed to live, to grow, and, after a rocky first season, to become the greatest show on television. Creator Matt Groening cranked out biting social commentary and domestic satire on a weekly basis, and all was well with the world. Seasons two through nine were perfect in every way.The show was always a cut above the rest, and then season ten came along, and the show dropped a few notches, still great, but faltering (the focusyn episode rates as one of the worst television episodes ever broadcast). Every once and a while, it would achieve the same level of quality that it had once delivered on a regular basis (the perfect game episode, the guest star episodes with Parker Posey and Mel Gibson, and of course, Behind the Laughter). However, I still had to face the facts, after eight years of delivering top notch entertainment, my beloved 'Simpsons' was becoming mediocre. By the end of season ten, and with Matt Groening's rookie series, 'Futurama,' doing better episodes than it on an almost regular basis, it had almost dropped to the level of 'The Drew Carey Show,' which, although it is another favourite of mine, is no 'Simpsons.' Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, enter season eleven, which started off promisingly with a good Halloween special and the Who episode, but has quickly faded into even greater mediocrity than season ten.Don't get me wrong, I still like the show, it isn't bad, all you have to do is compare it to 'Dharma & Greg' to see that, but its becoming painfully average. Watching it now, I get the feeling of watching a beloved family member die. I grew up with 'The Simpsons' and now its falling apart, the scathing satire, the beautifully crafted wit, its all melting away now, and I'm sad to say, I hope for cancellation to come soon, for the shows sake and my own.","10","12 December 2000"

It is nearly impossible to find out what channel Conan O'Brian and David Letterman is on. The Simpsons on the other hand, started off poorly on a small norwegian channel broadcasting from England. But, suddenly the series exploded. What at first glance looke like a poorly animated kid's show, is actually the most humorous TV Show out there.My favorite has to be Chief Wiggum.  Once my father(who is a police officer) had a meeting at home with about 8 other officers, when they were done I was allowed to watch Simpsons. This particular episode highly portrayed Chief Wiggum, what can I say, all the police-officers loved it, they laughed so loud people heard us through the entire neighbourhood.

"781","The Simpsons is unparalleled in its ability to hold up for ridicule human institutions and is witty and clever in satirising human behaviour. The Simpsons mocks with very effective satirical devices the police force, the government officials and makes hilarious usage of stereotypes.
One of my favourite Simpsons techniques is the way that often a character will look to intend to do one thing and then contradict themselves, or criticise some other character and then suddenly do the same thing wrong the other character was doing. Eg: When Moe is watching the wall in the tavern and then Homer says to Moe ""Can I watch to?"" Moe replies ""yeah but it'll cost ya"". Homer runs off to get money and then Moe says ""He's so stupid and now back to the wall"". Moe is stupid himself as he is leaving the tavern vulnerable to theft with his back turned.The Simpsons also does and excellent job in parodying musicals. I really enjoyed the send up of Mary Poppins with 'Shary Bobbins' the parody of her. The songs 'Cut every Corner' and 'Minimum Wage Nanny' do not put down the musicals, they merely place a humorous twist and new flavour on it.Finally, without The Simpsons many adults would turn away from cartoons. The Simpsons is useful in showing us ""The dysfunctional family"". Many families are not necessarily well-oiled machines. This is good because it contrasts to other T.V. families like ""The Brady Bunch"" and ""The Partridge Family"". These families were unrealistically always happy and well functioned. You should watch Simpsons whenever you get the chance because its simply unparalleled as a hilarious, satirical and animation masterpiece!",NA,"7 January 2000"
"782","The Simpsons is the greatest TV show in the history of the Universe.How can some people even compare it with Seinfeld and ugh... South Park?!?!South Park, come on. The Simpsons uses other means than a dancing piece of feces and constant sexual innuendos to entertain. Against the Simpsons, South Park is a trendy piece of trash show that gets old after about 2 episodes. I've seen almost all of the Simpsons hundreds of episodes and enjoyed almost every one. And Seinfeld uses the same cheap tactics every show, usually Jerry and someone else repeating a cliche term over and over to each other e.g. yada yada. Come on people, Seinfeld is funny too, but nowhere near as creative, fun to watch, or funny as the God of all TV shows...THE SIMPSONS!!!!!!!!",NA,"4 October 2000"

"785","Little can be said about the Simpsons in 1,000 words or less, and that fact alone says a great deal about the longest running sitcom on television.  Academic books have been written about the Simpsons, and its longevity and success in both production and syndication speak to its quality as a series.  Since most readers are already familiar with the Simpsons, I will address my remarks to the newcomer.  The Simpsons is an animated series about a dysfunctional family and the dysfunctional town in which they live.  It is at times satirical, analytical, heartwarming, downright silly, and everything in between.  This is because the Simpsons has changed a great deal over the course of its long run (14th season as of this writing).  In the beginning, Simpsons episodes were more down- to-earth; great detail was given to even minute aspects of the show, and in general each episode made a subtle point about American family life.  As the seasons progressed and the writers experimented more with the freedom animation allows, the episodes became less like real life, but were then able to make points and generate humor in ways viewers had not seen before. Recent seasons of the Simpsons have presented episodes that have more emphasis on humor and satire, and less on the small details (both in animation and story layout) that made earlier seasons so different from traditional cartoons.  Some people believe that Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart, and Maggie have served their purposes and need to retire to syndication for good, but I for one think they have a few good years left.",NA,"8 January 2003"

My favourite episode is probably Revenge Is A Dish Best Served Three Times. This is a great, funny cartoon.","10","3 April 2022"
"788","The Simpsons is my favorite television program of all time (And Frasier). The animated sitcom is witty, and incredibly brilliant. Sure, it is no longer in it's climax, but it is still the most entertaining program, made up of interesting and humorous storylines, clever jokes, some cool guest-stars (Although many of them are annoying, I enjoyed the guest-star appearances of Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce), and one of the best elements of all: parodies! If it weren't for the Simpsons spoofs on classic movies, I may not have been introduced to such marvelous films as Cape Fear, An Officer and a Gentleman, The Night of the Hunter, and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. So, yes, you people who dislike the show nowadays do make some good points, but I believe it is still a great animated sitcom, definately worth it's acclaim and glory.

I like all these shows, but The Simpsons is my favourite TV Show ever.In the UK, we have the Simpsons on every night, and Monday - Friday there are at least 3 episodes - 1 on Channel 4, and 2 on Sky 1. Sky 1 even shows 4 episodes on a Monday night, and 2 on each weekend day. Channel 4 show 2 episodes on a Sunday now too. So that means there are 23 episodes on per week... I do my best to watch everyone of them. I can get by without the Simpsons, even if i miss a new episode but if it's on - I'll watch it. It's that simple.I love Homer. He's a unique character. Sure there are other bumbling TV Fathers out there, like Tim 'The Tool Man' Taylor on Home Improvement, but the fact is that Homer's sheer stupidity and innocence have made him a television legend. Perhaps to some extent, I don't find the rest of the Simspons family as funny, but they play a vital role to the show's dynamics.The real reason I watch the Simspsons so much though is catching all the other characters, like Moe, Chief Wiggum, Apu and Ned Flanders, say quite sensationally funny things. They've improved Wiggum brilliantly in the last 10 seasons of the show.Watch this show, you may not love it as much as I do, but make it a favourite because it is immense viewing. Watch Seasons 4-7.

Going for over 20 years now the show is only getting better and better with age. I know no one that as ever disliked the Simpson's and that in its self is a great achievement.World class characters that define an era of great entertainment and for so long now it out does its self and every episode is better that the last.The great comedy value of a mixed up middle class family in Springfield and top supporting characters is what has kept the show up to scratch for so long. It's had so many brilliant guest stars over the years such as Paul McCartney, Elton John and Simon Cowell etc, which highlights the shows reputation not only in America but in the world.The show recently passed its 500 episode mark, lets hope it can pass the 1000 mark because a world without the Simpson's is not a world worth watching television.I've watched the show since I was a young kid and have never been more satisfied with a remarkable piece of television art.

I feel that the Simpsons is and will always be a timeless show,so why are you stretching it out so long into 15, 16, who knows how many years to come. I believe that every show was great until the mid tenth or mid eleventh year. I will say that I probably have watched the first ten seasons probably 30 times to each episode, but the last five maybe once or twice, to be honest they turn my want to view them off so much.I believe that the Simpsons will go down in the history books as a show where the kids have never heard of history books, or books.JerBlaha",NA,"13 August 2005"

"802","The Simpsons is the best television show ever made. Seasons 2-7 (and some of 8-10) have produced some of the defining moments on television history. Last Exit To Springfield (the one where the plant goes on strike) is hands down the best television program EVER in the history of television. In fact, Seasons 2-7 are perfect except for a few blunders.Unfortunately, in recent years, the show has declined in quality. It started at the very end of Season Seven with Homerpalooza, the worst episode of the Simpsons ever. It was a grim vision of things to come. Season Eight was OK (it did have the second best episode ever, The Springfield Files), but it lacked the quality of past seasons. Season Nine was a huge disappointment with some real clunkers (Principal And The Pauper, the one where Principal Skinner is found to be a fraud), miserable writing and no really great episodes. Needless to say, my hopes weren't that high for Season Ten.Season Ten was a bit like Season One. The show's popularity was at an all-time high, but the episodes were pretty bad (although most point out that Season One was a foundation of sorts to the Simpsons, which is definitely true.). Season Ten was embarrassingly awful. Most of the episodes were absent of any magic that embraced the earlier episodes, and most importantly, dumped satire for pop culture references. All of the characters are now fully developed, and there's nothing much else to do except retread, which can be pretty painful.I therefore say that Season 11 will most likely be the last season. And it should be. The Simpsons are done, the show has finished developing. It's pointless to continue to produce such crap and tarnish such an incredible series.Before I close, I'd like to say that even though Season Ten was horrible, I still look forward to watching the Simpsons as much as I can. If you watch a bad episode enough, it'll either grow on you and you'll stop hating it. Sometimes, you watch it a lot, and you still hate it. But at least this show is so dense and deep that you can argue about the best and worst episodes. You can't do that watching any other show (except maybe Star Trek, All In The Family and Frasier).",NA,"10 July 1999"

It's a funny show because it satires real life.  It shows us that we are not perfect and that we're not all rich, popular, or smart.  I'll admit that this season has not been as good as the previous 9 but it has its moments.  If you ever see a John Swartzelder episode you'll be hooked.",NA,"9 April 1999"
"806","This programme really is simply the best! It is made up of fun, witty - one liners, and much more into this action packed, 25 minutes.I'm scottish, and this is my favorite sitcom (or programme) ever! My favorite charecters are Mrs. Krabappel, Bart, Maggie, Homer and Lisa (but I love all of the other characters, they are all funny in their own way!)I tune into my TV every Monday at 6pm on BBC2, for a single episode, and every Friday, same time, for a double bill. I love the episode, Lisa's first word, it is excellent! But I dont have a fave., every episode is good in its own way! I'm sure about the seasons though, because BBC2 tends to show episodes from all different seasons, at different times, so it is confusing!The Simpsons is the ultimate world-wide show (or american), so forget about Frasier (it is soooooo boring!), or Friends, the simpsons are the one to watch! (The rug rats are great too!)I think the actors have so much talent, each and every one of them deserves an oscar, an emmy, a BAFTA or whatever, they are no ordinary actors.I have to say, the Simpsons videos I have (Bart wars, Sex, lies and the simpsons, the last temptation of Homer, the simpsons greatest hits, moaning lisa , and lastly - crime and punishment) are all excellent, so I highly recommend buying the videos (or you can tape of the TV too, which I do as well)Who knows, maybe one day the Simpsons really will rule the world!",NA,"23 January 2000"
"807","the simpsons are still making me laugh and i dont know what you people are talking about.  others who wrote for imdb say that the last 2 seasonz have been below average.  i tend to disagree.  and some people talk about plot.  who needs plot.  its a cartoon.  i just wanna sit down every night and watch the simpsons and enjoy the satire.  its gold and will always stay that way.  my personal favorite part of the entire show stands above the rest of the jokes and i hope you agree.  it is in the episode when apu, the hilarious store owner and his wife manjula are getting married.apu says : ""the only person that can save my marriage is GANESHA""homer says : ""GANESHA ehhh""and so homer grabs a big GANESHA head and puts it on then he goes and walks down and says :""look at me. im GANESHA.""then a guy stands up and sayz : ""you are not GANESHA. GANESHA is graceful""and homer gets chased away by the guy.thats gold. as a devoted hindu, i know that whenever there is a major ceremony you have to pray to GANESHA.  GANESHA is the destroyer of obstacles. thus he would help the marriage not have problems.the show is still the best.  anybody who says its losing its flare and enjoyment i would have to say your wrong.  you should be thrown into a pit from being a traitor and being disloyal to the simpsons.peace",NA,"25 December 2000"

It may be only a 22 minute cartoon about an average american town, but The simpsons has had over 250 episodes in 11 years.The show is really funny, with lots of mad characters & brilliant episodes, only very few let the show down.

"809","This show was once my favorite show; I would actually make a serious effort to watch every episode I could, every day of the week.Ever since, I guess around 2003, the quality of the show has declined so much. Its not even funny anymore. I've actually been satisfied with only 3 of the last 60-ish episodes.It seems that now, rather than entertain people and be the funniest show on TV, all they're trying to do is become the longest-running TV series ever, and while they do that they grind the shows reputation into the ground. What was once my favorite show, I can now say I honestly hate. What the hell is wrong with Fox? They create crappy series after crappy series, and when they find something good, they milk it for all its worth, with no respect for either it or the viewers intelligence.If you want to laugh at something funny, and not spoiled by the creator's and actor's greed, and hasn't been worn out by the passing of time, I strongly recommend that you enjoy the recently returned show 'Family Guy' (Fox, with another of its famous screw-ups, canceled it back in 2001).I HATE The Simpsons now. It can be called a 'classic' or a land-mark in TV history. But frankly, I think its just 'crap'.",NA,"29 August 2005"

"811","The Simpsons, at first, started out quite well. It was enjoyable to watch, and added some clever humor at times. It also had characters that had distinct personalities that you could get to know. Now, it is time for The Simpsons to be put to rest. The first couple of seasons were good, then it started to degrade into cheap slapstick humor, and totally impossible situations. The characters have all changed too, and are not as good as they used to be. It seemed before, that the episodes had some sort of resolve to them. Now, it had sunken to the phase of random insanity, where the episodes make little or no sense.

"816","You might feel disappointed if you saw the early version of ""The Simpsons""(like, before 1992 or so). But luckily, Matt Groening is improving with his skills. And that made him the best writer of comic series. His gifted intelligence led him to draw Futurama, which is also good.
Homer, the main character of this series, is one of the stupidest person in the world. His stupidness causes all the laugh and show us what we may never could do.

"818","Hey, im a simpson fan at the age of 17. This masterpiece started when i was three, but that had not stopped me from watching the first few seasons. I, like any simpson fan, have the 1st season on dvd and some books about the simpsons, a guide if you will towards mastering the psyche of every character in this tale of one city. I know that after watching an episode, i not only laugh, but the show makes you think about events in history, and thoughts on what will happen.Let's all face the facts. The Simpsons has been running for a tremendous amount of time, entertaining a variety of age groups and re-kindling lost cultures. Many people liked the first seven seasons of it, and hated the 8th.The best episode in my opinion in the 8th season was entitled ""Burns, Baby Burns"". The guest star was Rodney Dangerfield, who played Burns' son. This episode had quite possibly the best ending in any Simpson episode. It was in front of the ""Aztec Theatre"", and Rodney's character was pleading for his father's love in front of everyone in Springfield, but the cold-hearted Burns refused. Rodney quickly threw an impromptu street party; The song being played? None other than the same song being blasted from Dangerfield's golf-bag in the film ""Caddyshack""; Journey's ""Any Way You Want It""Some people say that too many celebrities are used in the show playing themselves and should play random characters in an episode. The fact is, hardly anyone's voice would be recognized if their name would not appear while the credits are rolling. They've tried it with the obvious Kelsey Grammer playing ""Sideshow Bob"" and they did a very nice job having ""Cecil"", Bob's brother, be played by David Hyde Pierce; who if you don't recognize, plays Grammer's brother in the television series ""Frasier"". These voices are familiar to most Americans. And the fact is, like some lucky americans, they meet a celebrity here and there. I have met a very funny celebrity named Jim Breuer, who lives in my hometown.When will this masterpiece come to an end? Hopefully never. But sadly all good things must come to an end. When the show finally gets cancelled, im sure America will not react the same when ""Seinfeld"" stopped playing new shows, but it will affect alot of people. I hope that the simpsons remain on the air on some television station. A creation so remarkable must. I do know that the Simpsons now have ten old episodes airing per week and one new episode. Please support the show. Fox has been great to this show. Look it up in your tv guide and put it on, i know you'll laugh and think after you watch an episode.",NA,"30 April 2002"
"819","More intelligent than Family Guy, More child friendly and not as obvious as South Park and just plain funnier than King Of The Hill.And came before all of the above.Even in its 18th series its still probably the best animation on TV and still up there with the funniest shows around.Its glory days were season 4 to 8, every episode was genius and the way the characters have evolved since the early days is amazing.As people have said it works on so many levels, I can sit in a room with kids who laugh at the visual jokes, myself (23) and my extended family of all ages who all find something in the show.It did trail off somewhere pretty badly in the early 2000's but I do think the last series of so is a bit of a return to form.For the best though I recommend series 4,5 and 8. My favourite episode?.... You Only Move Twice","10","11 January 2008"
"820","I absolutely LOVE the Simpsons. No matter how much i watch them, i never get enough. I keep asking myself: ""Why is that?"". Because of the stupidness of Homer ( ex. Scully: Homer, we're going to ask you a few simple yes or no questions. Do you understand? Homer: Yes. (lie detector blows up) )? Because of the situations usual people never get into? Or maybe because of the hilarious characters? All of them together. That's what makes the Simpsons. That's what makes this show worth watching. And exactly that is what makes the Simpsons one of the greatest TV-shows of all time. If you love silly characters, stupid jokes, and sometimes sad moments (usually lessons, which Homer learns at the end of each episode), you will love the Simpsons. Do yourself a favor and take some time off, buy a DVD of the Simpsons and watch, laugh and enjoy.","10","5 April 2008"
"821","The Simpsons has been on the air since 1989.  It pokes fun at everything and everyone, including itself.  The episodes work well on many different levels of humor and each time you watch you'll probably notice something new or some detail you missed before.  That's part of the reason the Simpsons do so well in syndication.The characters have changed over the years and new ones have been added, but the general feel of the Simpsons hasn't changed. Satirical humor at its best, no one is safe from their comedic gaze. The Simpsons has become the longest running television comedy and I for one still find the new episodes to be hilarious. Sure, some things have been done a bit much, but the great part is, the writers know that and at least acknowledge it before they milk a certain plot some more.Kudos to you Simpsons!",NA,"30 January 2004"
"822","I know some people think it's fashionable to say that the Simpsons has ""lost it"". Lost what? Has anyone actually tried watching some of the episodes from the earlier seasons? Those episodes are so inferior to the later ones (and I am not referring to animation/technical issues here, but everything) that I can't really believe I enjoyed them when they were on the air. On the other hand I was something like 12 years old or so when the very first episodes (dis)graced the TV-screen. Recent episodes have lost the miserable sentimentality which all of us already get far too much of from any lousy sit-com, and are now all about satire, which is just the way it should be. Come to think of it ""recent"" might be the wrong term - the show gained momentum somewhere around season 5, and hasn't really lost it since (apart from some relapses into sugarcoated BS, particularly in episodes featuring much of Lisa). Apart from Family Guy, which cannot be beaten even by the original, this is by far the best show to ever come out of the US. All categories included.",NA,"18 August 2003"
"823","For eight seasons, the Simpsons was the greatest show ever. It had hilarious writing, colorful amiation, lovable characters, and a life-time supply of brilliant one-liners. What also amazes me about the show is how consistent it was in it's prime. Some of the episodes stood out more than others, sure (Rosebud, Last Exit to Springfield, Homer at the Bat) but each one was great in its own way. Also, the show depicted a flawed but loving family who always survived in the end. This was a refreshing change from sitcoms that showed families who were perfect and never had any problems. This show also looked at serious issues like alcoholism, religious fundamentalism, feminism, etc. The show had so many memorable moments its hard to write them all down. But who could forget Sideshow Bob singing the HMS Pinafore at Bart's request, or Homer's ''Land of Chocalate Fantasy after Mr. Burns sells the nuclear plant to Germans. Unfortunately, after season 9, the show began to slip. The animation became less inspired and the jokes got stale. The writers began to rely more on celebrity guest appearances than clever writing and sight gags. Its a shame, really, but thanks to DVD we can still enjoy the show during it's glory days.","10","12 September 2009"
"824","This show is a classic and will never be beaten. its even been nominated or AGOLDEN GLOBE, which must mean something. my fave character is homer Simpson without a doubt. he just makes the show better, i hope this show doesn't stop cumin up with ideas, and lasts for many years to come! I ALSO LIKE Bart Simpson because of all his popular quotes like , ay qarumba, eat my shorts, I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are u? and Lisa because shes just SO smart and mature for her age, Maggie is adorable and Marge's voice is so annoying but i still love it! definitely one of the wackiest families on TV! i love the Simpson's","10","7 October 2009"

I have also watched re-runs from seasons that I hadn't seen. From my guess, I would have to say that the show was at its best from seasons 4-8, with classic episodes as ""Lemon of Troy,"" etc. Seasons 10-13 were considered the worst part of the show, but it also had some good episodes such as ""Trilogy of Error.Now I will talk about the past season, season 14. It has had some good and bad episodes, and in my opinion, it has been better than seasons 10-13. If I had to compare it to another season in terms of quality, it would probably be compared to season 9.

"828","I started watching ""The Simpsons"" when I was very little, of course I didn't understand it at all I just liked to watch cartoons.  Later as I grew up I started to understand this show a bit more, and the comedy started to come to me.  Soon enough I found that I was addicted to this show.  I watched, and still do watch this show as many times as I can.""The Simpsons,"" started on 1989.  Before that they were just short clips on ""The Tracy Ulman Show.""  Of course I wasn't alive then to see it.
""The Simpsons"" is just a wonderful show.  There are some people who just say, ""The Simpsons is a stupid show, Blah blah blah is much better,"" and almost all the time those people haven't even seen it.  This show's humor cannot be beat.  Almost every episode is a satire of something else.  Its generally not too hard to see it.  Some are based on The Bible, some are on movies, some are on books.  The ideas for this show are genius.  1,000 words are not enough to explain ""The Simpsons."" You could write a book on this. It wouldn't be hard at all.If you haven't seen ""The Simpsons"" before, then I really reccomend you to watch it.  Just one episode, and if you don't like it then keep watching all those Reality shows.  Go ahead, you won't learn anything from Reality shows except how to waste a good 30 minutes of your life, no offense to those who do watch them.  Just give it a shot, I mean what do you have to lose? This show is magnificient, the older episodes and the new ones.
""The Simpsons"" is the longest running cartoon show, do you think they'd keep it on the air because it was awful?",NA,"19 February 2004"
"829","Why do I feel the need to post the 200th review in the 25th season of a show that's almost universally known? Because it's a show that defined an era. Has it declined in quality? Yes, but that's normal. Everything has a golden age before slowly cracking and crumbling away. However, I don't believe the show is crumbling yet. It may have cracks, it isn't perfect (you show me a show that is), but it's trying. There have been massive failures like Lisa Goes Gaga *shudder*, but also massive successes. However, people tend to focus only on the negative, that's just human behavior, and refuse to see some of the episodes for the comedy gold they truly are. Have the newer episodes been a bit of a letdown? Unfortunately, yes. Still, I hold out hope that they will get a second wind and dominate Sunday night once again. If you're looking for a show to watch and are on the fence about this show, don't watch the newer episodes (season 20 and up), try to watch the earlier ones (seasons 1-10) and make the decision from there. I also believe there's a certain pressure to hate the new Simpsons episodes. Because the internet doesn't like it, you shouldn't either. But you have a mind, use it. Form your own opinion and if it makes you laugh, laugh away. I rate this a 9/10 simply because, like I said, it isn't perfect, but it's pretty darn close. Thank you for reading and I hope this helped you or was at least mildly entertaining :)","9","9 June 2014"

In all their 15+ seasons there have been no major slip up's or embarrassments and that is quite an achievement for a show with 300+ episodes.The shows influence is immeasurable, there characters are pop culture icons. Catch phrases are repeated by children in almost every western world country in the world and almost every celebrity worth pursuing have guest starred.I could write for hours about the subtle adult humor that lies under the slapstick and black comedy on the surface.Any fan of comedy should go out and buy the first 5 seasons on DVD as these are the most immortal and legendary of all episodes.I will finish by saying that i can see this show continuing for quite some time, and when it does finally get canceled it will be a sad day for TV and the end of possibly the greatest TV show of all time.",NA,"30 June 2005"

However I've been watching the Simpsons since I was 7. And i've seen family guy as well, which albeit funny, is not even close to the level of humor the simpsons has. I do not expect this show to be surpassed for a long time, its only competition as of now would be Rick and Morty.

"840","One of the best, if not the best animation series on television.  One of the reasons it's the best is that ""The Simpson"" are not aimed for younger viewers. It has adult humor and its satirical view of society makes it the ""Saturday Night Live"" of animation.  From imitating the Kennedy's political family to the controversial current events of society (blaming problems on, and deportation of, immigrants, and ""Anybody who speaks German can't be evil""- Helen Lovejoy), ""The Simpson"" has it all and did it all.",NA,"24 December 1998"

"843","Although seasons 9 and 10 are greatly inferior to the previous 8 seasons, The Simpsons still ranks as a show that's incredibly funny and insightful for anyone who watches it.  Many TV critics praise the show as being ""subversive satire.""  They're all wrong; satire is but one of the many comedic styles used by the show; we also see subtle sight gags, pratfalling slapstick, character-based foibles, thinly veiled self-reference, fullblown parodies of movies like ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,"" more subtle, obscure references, spoofs of trite TV and movie cliches; and so on.  The fact that the show is a cartoon lends many advantages, the biggest being the wide range of characters voiced by a small troupe of actors.  Over 60 residents of Springfield join the core family as recurring characters, from crochety, ancient nuclear-power tycoon Monty Burns, to ambulance-chasing attorney Lionel Hutz (""I've argued in front of every judge in the state.  Often as a lawyer."")  Another advantage of being a cartoon is that the adult voice actors bring to life a subcast of children who are as rich in character as the adults; Bart, for example, is well-known as a troublemaker, but his everpresent feelings of guilt and remorse set him apart from South Park's Cartman and the like.  Lisa is simply one of the deepest characters ever created for TV.  The quintessential Simpsons joke comes in the episode where Homer moonlights instructing people on how to have a successful marriage. When Homer starts telling tales of his sex life to his students, Marge justly gets angry and throws him out of the house.  In a scene near the end, Marge is driving through town, and she hears Homer's ghostly voice in her head: ""Won't you marry me Marge?"" ""I'll be a daddy? Oh, that's wonderful!"" ""We'll always stay together.."" and as the expression on Marge's face softens, we can see where this is going: she's going to forgive Homer, drive home, and make peace with him.  But instead, she turns her head around, and sees Homer in the back seat talking through a cardboard tube.  She throws him out and drives off, as angry with Homer as ever.  We were set to believe this was to be the touching climax, then we're thrown a total curve (and are left wondering how Marge mistook Homer speaking out loud for her own memories!)  Of late, the show has started to center around Homer getting into wild adventures, but this still can't tarnish the legacy of the Simpsons. Ignore formulaic, restrictive sitcoms like Seinfeld and Friends. This is THE defining TV show of the 90's.",NA,"1 August 1999"

"845","The more recent episodes (200th was so disappointing), I do not feel are as good as they were in the late eighties/early nineties.  I had watched it almost every week since I was seven(in 1989)years old, however, since around 1995, it has slowly lost a lot of humor and characters seem to have taken different identities. For example, Lisa used to be presented as an innocent, childlike, though intelligent little girl. She loved ponies (remember the Christmas list?)and The ""Happy Little Elves""(from the Babysitter Bandit episode).  She refused to watch stolen cable ""Sorry, I'd rather go to heaven!"", but now an eight year old knows what sodomy means? Then there's Homer. He was silly and dense.  He obviously wasn't very smart and he knew it. He loved his family but felt inferior because he knew they weren't perfect. ""Be normal! Be NORMAL!!""  I remember a time when he brought the family into the dining room(instead of in front of the TV) to eat. He was just a silly old guy and now he's terribly annoying.  He had a dream in which God spoke to him, and several years later he said how he liked God because he's his ""favorite fictional character."" Marge has always seemed like a moral person. She didn't want the Casino put up, she wanted to fix main street instead of buy a monorail, and she opposed Homer skipping church.  Now wanting to get rid of the burlesque house makes her an annoying person(how did she look after the Spring in Springfield song?"" Sideshow Bob was being dragged away after one of his first or second schemes had failed(before '92), and yelled that he would be out of jail when the democrats were back.  A few years later he ran as a rep. for mayor.  Did he change? Now the famous Bart- He's not a bad kid but he was presented in a sort of Dennis the Mennace kind of way, a mischevious little boy with little boy problems;trying to pass 4th grade, getting a crush on a girl, melting little plastic army men with a magnifying glass- I don't think his character is as developed in that way anymore. I say it used to be an 8.5 but more recently has gone to 6.5. Good episodes- War on Nelson, 1st/2nd Halloween Special, Stolen Cable, Genius Bart, Babysitter Bandit, Bigfoot Homer, Bart Gets an F, Catfish Lake, Lisa's Birthday.We the purple?

"846","""The Simpsons"" had five-and-a-half seasons of near-perfect episodes from the beginning of the 1990-1991 season to the middle of the 1995-1996 season, and it was a little depressing to see the show come down from that high, but the slide was inevitable.  You can't sustain intelligent, multi-layered, laugh-out-loud brilliance like that forever, and I was astounded to see the writers and producers keep the momentum going as long as they did. It's a different show now than it used to be, with a bigger emphasis on Homer's wacky adventures rather than the entire family's dysfunction (call me a sap, but I miss the tenderness of episodes like ""Lisa's Substitute,"" ""When Flanders Failed"" and ""Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song""), but it's still consistently funny.  Many of us have grown up watching ""The Simpsons"" in awe and therefore feel very protective of it and defensive about which seasons are best.  It's understandable since the show has been so terrific for so many years and has given all of us lasting memories of well-earned laughter.  This show has had such a strange history, starting off with a huge merchandising push and media blitz in 1990, which led to some of the first 13 episodes landing in the Top 20 of the Nielsen ratings.  I think most of the fans would agree that the first half-season doesn't provide many laughs these days, but it's interesting to watch these episodes now and see the blueprint for future greatness.  By the fall of 1990, as ""The Simpsons"" entered its first full season opposite ""The Cosby Show"" on Thursday nights, the media hype died down and the ratings fell.  And then a wonderful thing happened: the show became a work of art.  The writers realized that repeating Bart's catchphrases each week wasn't going to satisfy them creatively, so they opened up the show to the vast realm of comedic and animated possibilities.  Even though the show is wackier now than it used to be, it has always operated on dream logic.  Unlike ""King of the Hill,"" which I also love, ""The Simpsons"" has never tried to be realistic.  It takes full advantage of its cartoon status, and that's one of the main reasons why it's so rewarding.  It also features the greatest running commentary about the love-it-or-hate-it medium of TV that I've ever seen (although ""SCTV"" and ""Late Night with David Letterman"" came close).  And no other show that I've seen has featured so many memorable and endearing supporting characters; we could all rattle off about 50 names.  Simply put, ""The Simpsons"" is the funniest TV show any of us will ever see.",NA,"10 July 2001"
"847","I'm fifteen years old.  I've seen every episode.  I just LOVE the show. Maybe too much. :)  It's excellent!!!! Who said that you can't learn anything from The Simpsons?  I learn something every episode!!!  Now I'm a fountain of useful and useless knowledge.  Some people won't let their kids watch it because they say it is a bad influence.  Bah!  I grew up watching it and I'm a straight A student in school.  It depends on how you perceive the show.  I understood that it was just a cartoon with yellow people who have only four fingers on each hand.  It isn't real.  I don't see a reason why parents shouldn't let their kids watch the show.  But that's just me. For all you parents out there, just watch the show a few times with an unbiased point of view.  You'll see that it isn't so bad!!!!  :D",NA,"3 September 2001"

I've been watchin it for 12 years and the Simpsons are always there to make me laugh since their first episode.  Homer and Bart are the 2 popular Simpsons characters that makes the show very popular and Lisa's a very sweet girl and a great mind.. Marge, I like her attitudes with her childrens.. She's a good mom, and Homer's the funniest dad ever!!  I love the Simpsons because of how funny they are and they make me laugh forever. My other favorite characters are : Apu, Snake, Barney, Moe, Milhouse, Mayor Quimby, Abe, and lots more.  I like all the characters coz they're all funny!  I've always been wishing that I could work in the Simpsons studio and get a better life there..Well, keep up the great work Matt Groening. Your die-hard fan, Ian",NA,"5 January 2001"

"852","The Simpsons is the funniest show of all time.  The only one ever within a thousand miles of it was the Critic and that was produced by the Simpsons' producers.  They basically ran out of plots after the first couple of years, which is what makes it so brilliant- it makes less and less sense all the time! I've seen hundreds of episodes but I don't think I've seen them all yet. I hope it has hundreds more episodes, that Homer keeps getting dumber and the plots keep getting stranger, because that's when it's brilliant.",NA,"1 July 2001"
"853","The first seasons (1-2) were something different, something that we didnt have seen but the great era comes right here (3-8) This was THE boom. I wont say that the Principal and the Pauper iss a bad episode, actually it is very good. Good jokes a history for Skinner and, yeah, it breaks the logic but do you remember that episode of the secret legion? and the one of the band? it has a bad end but there were already bad ends. The episode that is the one which shows the decrease is The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase its not a bad episode. Its because it confesses that they had no ideas left. And they made fun of that because they thought that was the final season, but NO, They continued 23 years more. But I say that the seasons 9 and 10 arent bad , actually theyre good, they have strong episodes but they arent as good as the first 8 seasons. Season 11 is not completely good but its enjoyable. Since season 12 it isnt usual finding a strong and loved episode","7","10 December 2020"
"854","The genre is a sitcom, the country of origin is USA, it was by Matt GROENING, and directed by Mark ANDERSON. The number of seasons is 32 and the number of episodes is 695, the original release is on 17 December 1989.The actors are Dan CASTELLANETA as Homer, Julie KAVNER as Marge, Nancy CARTWRIGHT as Bart, Yeardley SMITH as Lisa and Nancy CARTWRIGHT, James EART JONES, Elisabeth TAYLER and Jodie FOSTER as Maggie.The actors are the stereotyped American family of middle class. Homer is the father, he is the inspector of security in a nuclear plant. This activity favoris are drink, food, watch at television and sleep. Marge is patient, she makes ordering from home. Bart is the brother, he doesn't respect ordering and makes stupid thing. Lisa is the sister, she is passionate fond of saxophone. Maggie doesn't speak and spend his time to suck her baby-soother.I think this is the best series for me because I love the characters.

They used to be so funny, very edgy hardcore, but now you just messed them up and made them all sissy like, cuz every time I watch it there's some kind of musical number about something, Disney why don't you just stick to singing in your movies and leave The Simpsons alone, cuz I know deep down you don't have that kind of humor like they used to have when they was on Fox channel, so give us a break save your singing and dancing for your sappy movies and let the Simpsons be The Simpsons!!","6","1 December 2021"

"860","Everybody knows The Simpsons is an extraordinary accomplishment. I don't really need to elaborate on the finesse and universality it meticulously speaks to... the fact that it can be the subject of University courses, and yet still be watched with as much enthusiasm by a third grader, or the guy who owns the Pizza shop (and stay on for so long!), is a television triumph.What I would like to speak about, because it matters a great deal to me, are all the dramatic complaints about the 'dip in quality', which is a perfectly legitimate argument. What it comes down to is this though - does it make your life better to bash it, to watch it just to reaffirm how much you hate it? Are you really giving it a fair chance with those glasses on? Are you becoming Comic Book Guy, or are you staying real about this? That's not to say get a frontal lobotomy as you walk through life, but rather, to be strong enough to see the world and all its facets with an inclusive optimistic spirit. We owe it to ourselves, and we owe it to the world. That's the only way to create a life that's beautiful.When one sits down and watches an episode just to nag, they're always finding reasons in which they're 'right', but they never go away feeling very good for being right. Being 'right' is also being selfish - its a complicated human foible, but by being conscious of it, we can notice it when it creeps into our day to hold us down. Live for possibility, not for destructive things you think are there and reaffirm are there.I haven't been perfect at this state of mind while watching The Simpsons, or anything, but that's hardly the point. Its always a process. The point is, I've worked at doing the mature thing, which is actually GIVING IT A CHANCE! And believe it or not, I LOVE EPISODES FROM THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SERIES! And I'm grateful for that. There's a definite shift in style and content, and yes, at times I feel its devoid of conscience, but its also a choice to be bitchy, just as its a choice to complain and tolerate - either get out or get in, the fence always hurts! I've decided I'm gonna still see whats great about it, and perhaps even write for it one day. Either way, I'm gonna let myself win by still loving it!

"861","I think what makes the Simpson's so entertaining is the way it constantly forces us to look in the mirror and laugh at ourselves as a society and as individuals. It is politically IN-correct in this ridiculously politically correct world. It often brings into the open people's true motives and what people really think, something rare in our pretensious society.What's amazing is the that as funny and entertaining as the Simpsons family are, Groening has surrounded them with a cast of dozens that are all amazingly and equally real and funny. From Apu to Otto to Chief Wiggum to Smithers to Dr. Hibbert to Skinard, and so on and so on, they are all hilarious and identifiable. I would venture to say that I could watch an entire episode WITHOUT the Simpson family included and it would still be just as good. I've never seen anything like it on another TV series.It's sad that so many don't ""get"" the simpsons. They either don't get the humor, don't give it a chance, or think it's a kid show. The latter especially are sadly mistaken. This may be a cartoon, but it's hardly a kid show. In fact, my opinion is that the more knowledgable/intelligent you are, the more you will enjoy this show.the bottom line is it's the best 30 minute TV show ever created, hands down. I challenge anyone to say different.",NA,"13 February 2002"

Marge is great too because she has that over protective boring mom personality. Lisa has that ""I'm all alone and smart"" type of thing, like me. And Bart is like my brother, he doesn't know when to shut his mouth. But I love Bart! Every episode has that great adventure or problem in it, I guess that's why I always tune in at 6 every night, even though I've seen like every episode, I never get tired of it!

"866","The Simpsons is a cartoon people of all ages can enjoy. But when it comes to the new episodes, you have to be a first-time watcher to enjoy it. If you have been watching the simpsons since at most '95, you will notice the newer episodes don't make you fall on the floor, laughing uncontrollably. The newer episodes have no plot.(and they admit it.) Remember the ""first day of spring"" episode?? That was one of the many terrible episodes. If you are 12 and do not agree with me, ask and older brother who has been watching for about 6 years or so.",NA,"1 January 2003"
"867","In the beginning, there were The Simpsons, ""crudely drawn"" bumpers on The sadly overlooked Tracy Ullman Show.It's 2003 and we in beijing who are lucky enough to have Star TV out of hong kong (chinese nationals aren't allowed to have this show) are watching season 11 every sunday night and loving every minute of it as if it were 1989 once again. I'm 39 years old and life stops when the simpsons come on just like when i'm back home in the states. What's nice is that star runs ""reruns"" monday thru friday, so I get to catch up on season missed when i was in part of the world that didn't have it (or if they did have it, it was dubbed into the local language.  I ain't in to that at all.)I remember being very skeptical when plans were announced to take these 30 sec. ammusing ""outro"" to the commercials and turn them into a full-fledged sit-com.  I gave it 13 episode, if they were lucky and they'd be back on Tracy Ullman (were she to survive another season, which she barely did but only one, unfortunately.  I miss her.)Reading the comments here, i had no idea so many people hated the Simpsons. I really don't understand it, especially when they are comparing it to Friends, which was always ludicrous and never funny (the success of that show reminds me of the sucess of The Beverly Hillbillies #1 for many many years; Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley all #1 for years and years)and Seinfeld (my dad's favorite show), which lacks any character you can root for, therefore, never have i laughed once at that show.  In twenty years, I predict (I have been very wrong before) both Friends and Sienfeld will be totally forgotten or looked upon as ""Why was that show so successful?"" as we do today with Hillbillies, HDs and L&S.The Simpsons will live on forever.  Each carefully crafted episode, and there are over 300 at this writing, i think, is ageless, timeless, and will not date itself.  Ever.  The writing continues to provoke and more importantly, it is very consistant.  That is the key - consistancy.  Sure, you maybe able to find a bad episode from time to time, but by and large, the writing and the animation continue to be of the highest quality, not to mention the voice actors are perfectly cast.  i always see something new in episodes i've watched a half a dozen times. How many shows can you say that about?  Not too many i don't think.The Simpsons is fresh in much the same way that The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Honeymooners (foretting these two are B/W) and All in the Family are fresh and vibrant (albeit AITF an issue oriented ""time capsule"" show. I'll use certain episodes to teach in american lit. classes.) today as they were when they were new, maybe even more so now. I don't think time will be very kind to Friends (illegal DVDs are appearing here in china.  Sadly, the Chinese have caught the Friends bug too.  Again, i really don't get it.)  or Sienfeld, or even another personal favorite, Married With Children, i think it will look old in twenty years.  Maybe it already does.I realize why my members of my family hate The Simpsons.  They are LDS!! And they think it's trash. The Simpsons pokes fun at EVERYTHING including Christians and that's what makes it so alive.  Anybody can get lampooned. Maybe i'm more opened to a good gag because i live in a country where people wouldn't ever think of animating Chairman Mao or Zhang Zemin because they would simply ""disappear"".  (The Chinese communist party has no sense of humor)  So when i see the George Bush/Gerry Ford episode, (which is not one of the best) I have to say that The Simpsons is all-american and it represents what makes america such a great country... by poking fun at it's flaws, of which there are many and because we can. As Americans, we don't have to live within the  confines of the phony patriotism i am exposed to over here in the People's (that's a laugh) Republic (insanity) of China (no humor).  And after more than a decade, Matt Groeing and his gang or artists, and i mean everyone involved with show is an artist - the simpsons is a work of art - they do it better than anybody else.",NA,"5 May 2003"

So the new series' have bad episodes in them, in case you didn't notice so did the old ones. Bart the general, Krusty gets Kancelled and The telltale head are prime examples of episodes which should never have been aired which came out before 1999. And lets not forget that the new ones obviously have way better graphics and sound that makes them much easier to watch.

"872","I think The Simpsons is still and awesome show, whether or not it's gotten kind of dumb over the last three years. I agree with other users that The Simpsons are just not what they used to be, and that they were the funniest from about '92-'99. For one thing, the animation is too detailed. One reason why past episodes were so funny is that the animation was still developing. I can't really put my finger on it, but for some reason that made it funnier. But I understand that the animation will keep changing as time goes on. Another problem is Homer Simpson cries too much. He starts throwing a tantrum over the stupidest things. Past episodes where funny because Homer was a big idiot. Not a big baby. And the plot lines were hilarious too. For example, when Lisa becomes a vegetarian. The flying pig gag is classic! Or when Homer and Grandpa make the love tonic.""But I'm using my whole a**"". That's the kind of play with words we want to see. Or when George Bush moves across the street. You get the idea. But now we have plots that are ridiculous. Like when Marge was a body builder, or when she got implants, but the worst was when Ned Flanders slept with that lady up on the hillside. The idea that he was so churchy made his character funny. I think that episode destroyed his character completely. Don't get me wrong though. I still watch The Simpsons every Sunday night in hopes that it will be a good episode and I think you all should too. And they're not all bad. The Simpsons hasn't completely lost its touch. There are still funny jokes here and there, and I think they should keep it on the air for as long as possible.",NA,"7 August 2003"
"873","No-one can argue with me, the Simpsons was, is and shall always be the greatest thing to hit the airwaves EVER! Who can ever create another character better than Homer J Simpson? If you actually think about it, most animated shows or sitcoms that have followed The Simpsons have as their main character a fat, stupid, alcoholic, blundering, loveable idiot.

The beauty of this series is that no matter what episode you watch, you don't have to be common with the Simpsons to enjoy and be amused.There is a reason why the Simpsons are still running today after almost 20 years!","10","13 July 2011"

And the voice over-actors are just great, especially Dan Castellaneta. The only bad thing is that it's, according to me not as fun as it used to be in season 2-5 but still, it can't get any better than this!Congratulations to everybody at The Simpsons!

"876","I've always been a big Simpsons fan, but watching the DVDs really made me realize how genius the show really is. Every episode has me laughing all the way through. The only other sitcom that was able to do that was Seinfeld. Shows like ""Selmas Choice"" (Marge, can I be alone with the sandwich for a moment?) and ""Marge vs. the Monorail"" (I call the big one Bitey!) are really the highlights of the series. Unfortunately, the last few seasons of this great show have been undeniably stale, relying on trendy guest stars and thin plot lines. I have hope, though, that this show will pull through. Even if it is to be cancelled, we still have the movie to hope for. If you are a Simpsons fan, or a fan of funny television in general, buy the Seasons 3 and 4 DVDs.

I am very successful in life and hey guess what, I watch Simpsons every week. So stop wasting your time telling everyone else why the show sucks. To all the fans like me stick together and watch the show all the time so that we will never have to see the frightful day when the world looses its humor.

"878","After 16 years you would think they would get old, but they haven't.Season 5 is in the prime of this young series. The comedy writing is highly entertaining in this, and in all seasons. There are many classic Simpsons episodes in this season, I am very fond of ""Lady Bouvier's Lover"". I like when the story is on one of the lesser characters. I had wondered what had become of Marge's mom. Also, ""Cape Feare"" is a great example of how the writers have 'borrowed' from the movies. I especially love Sideshow Bob's performance in this episode. If you are already a Simpsons fan you will love it, and already own it. If you are new to the Simpsons let me guarantee that you will fall in love with the series if you can handle their subtle messages for world peace. All in all the Simpsons are amazing, and so is season 5!",NA,"21 December 2004"
"879","Jellyneckr- Obviously, you don't know what you're talking about seeing as how the Simpsons is the longest running animated sitcom in TV history. Theview expressed in the show are intelligent and witty. Along with many political and religious undertones, there is also a sense of cultural criticism that this show likes to poke fun at and actually walks the line in doing so. Family Guy also has a great, somewhat intelligent, look at the mannerisms of our modern day culture. Maybe you'll give these shows another chance and try to see it from this point of view and realize that some of these types of shows actually have more realism than some people give them credit for, rather than thinking they are only ""cartoons"". These shows remind us that life doesn't always have to be looked at as so dire and serious, and to remember to laugh at life.The Simpsons is a part of our culture,that will never die.",NA,"19 December 2004"
"880","Though I've only started watching the Simpsons show a couple years ago, I've watched all of the 300 something episodes. FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY. Why? Because it's realistic, yet totally fictional. They add all these little things that make it great. There are probably over a hundred characters that appear regularly, and many more that just have side jobs and background filler positions. All of them with different personalities, traits, and features.Nobody can explain this show. You just have to watch it yourself to find out.REAL GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",NA,"27 December 2004"
"881","This show mostly follows the adventures and happenings of the Simpsons family. The father is Homer, an unbelievably incompetent drunkard who works at the local powerplant. The mother is Marge, the completely stressed housewife desperately trying to hold her family together. There son is Bart, the class clown. Lisa is the smart, sax playing, environmentalist daughter. Maggie is the shotgun wielding baby.Some episodes barely are about the family, instead featuring the over 100 recurring characters ranging from the ultra-religious Ned Flanders to the smart Sideshow Bob, who is dead set on killing Bart.I'm currently 12 and have been watching this show since I was 10. It has helped me become more aware of who people are with its references.The show is just plain hilarious. It is the only show that has the ability to start with the family sitting in the car on the way to the doctors, and end up with them immigrating back to America. You never are sure what is going to happen next in this hilarious show.",NA,"7 July 2005"
"882","The Simpsons is great! The old and new episodes! It's funny, fun to watch, great animation, etc etc etc. I just flat out love everything about this awesome show! Most episodes of this show are O.K. for kids to watch, unless you worry about Homer's frequent alcohol consumption. Some episodes have little sexual content, so watch out. About the bad language, however, from what I can tell, my 12 year old son hears worse in middle school than this show this has lots of story left. someone please write something about him coming back or homer having to go to court for being involved with is company. i loved Hank, he was funny. There isn't too much violence or cussing, although Homer excessively drinks beer. Either way, a very well written show except for the latest episodes (2004-Present). I would prefer the older ones.",NA,"27 May 2015"
"883","So excited about the new season starting Sunday. I love this show so much :) Not too thrilled about what the season premiere is gonna be about, though. This is gonna be a can't miss season. #EverySimpsonsEver. I don't want this show to end anytime soon. I am a huge fan of the show and have every episode so far. From every D'oh to every time Bart says ""Eat my shorts"", this show never miss a laugh. #EveryJokeEver. Do the Bartman :) #EveryItchyandSratchyEver. Haha, D'Oh, Eat My Shorts, #BestShowEver. #EveryPunchlineEver #TheSimpsonsSeason27. Don't miss Marge, Homer, Lisa, Bart, Maggie, and everyone else that lives in Springfeild.","9","23 September 2015"
"884","The Simpsons is a comic strip of a cartoon sitcom. It makes short jabs to get you to laugh but still holds a coherent story line while it's doing it. To appreciate the show you will need to start in a single digit season. The reason for this is because the show has been dead for many, many years. Season made after 2005 are hardly watchable and should never be supported/watched. They moved from character development and witty plot lines, like homer working for a James Bond villain for the sole reason he has great benefits, to a clich of itself. In summary watch the early seasons and avoid the latter seasons so we can stop those money grabbing basters from destroying one of the greatest shows of all time.","7","11 October 2016"
"885","The Simpsons, I strongly believe, will be the ONLY animated TV show to ever run for more than 15 seasons and still have more laughs coming. From 1989 to now! I wouldn't be surprised if it was still going by the time I turn 21 and that's quite a while from now. This is the best comedic-animated show I've ever seen. I grew up watching this show and I can only hope that the show will still be on when I have kids. This is the one show that I can say that I can never get bored with. All of the people doing the voices are all at ages that they can do another 20 years worth of shows. This is one of the very few shows that hasn't gone completely computer animated and fired all of it's animators. This show draws audiences of all ages and I don't think anything could change that.",NA,"13 November 2005"
"886","The Simpsons are without doubt the greatest comedy cartoon. I could easily say that most of the people reading this comment know Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge and Maggie. The Simpsons have been on air for quite a while but still it dint lose the comedy ""spirit"". The series have made fun of almost everything (religion, politics, celebrities etc.). The only reason for not loving the Simpsons is that it somehow offends you. The series first appeared on FOX in 1989 and instantly became a great hit. In the first few series the plots were usually concentrated on the Simpson family members but later on extended to citizens of Springfield like Apu, Krusty the clown and Ned Flanders. The Simpsons featured several guests like Leonard Nimoy, Mel Gibson, Pierce Brosnan and much more. Each episode has a unique plot, great jokes, guest stars and as i mentioned before, the comedy ""Spirit"".",NA,"15 October 2005"
"887","This is a great show. Funniness and even memes got through, but Lisa is the WCE! (WORST CHARACTER EVER!)Make a new character! One that's more silly and adventurous. Though. Good episodes make a good show.Spicing it up would be great. but I like it the way it is.","10","2 December 2017"
"888","I watch it every day! And it's great still! The animation is great! The music is good! And the voice actors sound cool!","9","16 December 2018"
