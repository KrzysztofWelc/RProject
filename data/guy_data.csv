"1","It's hard for me to rate this show. When looking back at the older seasons it seems to me like Seth and his crew had fun writing and voicing the characters. Occasionally there were musical numbers thrown into the mix, songs I know by heart and will forever be stuck in my head. Such as ""Shipoopi"" and ""It's a wonderful day for pie""We hardly get any of this nowadays. The gags are nowhere near as complex or funny as they used to be.Seems to me like the only reason this show is still running is because there is money involved and because some people ( like me ) are naive enough to keep watching even tho it's not what it used to be.I'm not angry at the state of this show, but it's sad to see what it's been reduced to.","7","30 July 2021"
"2","Seth MacFarlane = Genius. There are so many prized moments of humor in this show that I cannot help but laugh at them even if I've seen them dozens of times. The voice acting, the references to real life, the ideas, it's all a comedic treasure!","9","9 November 2021"
"3","Family Guy has been a laugh out loud funny show for almost 20 years now! It's easily one of my favorite comedies of all-time! Seth McFarlane is just an absolute genius who has done the impossible and that's make a show remain hilarious for over 2 decades now. There's not much I can say about this incredible show that hasn't already been said so just do yourself a favor and go watch it...you won't regret it!","10","15 June 2021"

"6","Spectacular, truly the animated series with the most beautiful family that exists, irreverent and fun to exaggerated levels. Beautiful from all points of view, each episode is a surprise and each episode makes you laugh at least once.","10","27 November 2021"
"7","The humour of this cartoon is outrageous in its own unique way. Compared to The Simpsons it is less coherent and compared to South Park it is more juvenile. Family Guy has a very distinct and memorable style that relies on constant cutaways to keep things fresh.","8","20 August 2020"
"8","Not sure if it's political correctness, that the formulae is stale, or what. But what used to be sometimes shocking, edging, weird and funny now pretty much elicts no laughter.","6","22 November 2021"
"9","I've currently been binging Family Guy and it's become one of my favourite shows. However, the only seasons I've seen in full as of writing are the first two, so my opinions may change if I watch later episodes. But from what I've seen so far, the newer seasons still have some genuinely great gems, unlike 2021 SML.","10","26 August 2021"
"10","So it's fair to say that it's lost some of its edge, and that the latter series aren't as good as the earlier years, but the success of Family Guy can't be argued with, it's still watched and adored by millions, and I'm one of its viewers. I think if they want to continue with it beyond the next Series they are going to need to tinker about with the formula somehow and freshen it up a bit, it's true some of the gags are being recycled, even still I still watch and howl with laughter. Stewie will forever be my favourite Griffin, and some of the caustic one liners are hilarious. For me it peaked around Series 4/5, but there have been some classic episodes since, the Brian and Stewie episodes are always fun.","8","21 May 2016"
"11","Network: Fox; Genre: Animated Comedy, Satire, Parody; Content Rating: TV-14 (pervasive sexual content, scatological humor, strong language, violence, animated nudity); Perspective: Contemporary (star range: 1-5); Season Reviewed: 5 seasons After 5 seasons, two cancellations and a now militant army of fans the show has amassed, I don't quite know what to say about ""Family Guy"" anymore.When ""Family Guy"" debuted in 1999 it was a shotgun blast of comic brilliance that came out of nowhere and went unheard by an audience still enraptured by the antics of ""Friends"". At first it all appears relatively routine, even - as many have accused - a ripe-off of ""The Simpsons"". Fat, child-like, head of household Peter Griffin (voiced by creator Seth MacFarlane) screws things up while dotting wife Lois (Alex Borstein), put-upon daughter Meg (Mila Kunis) and genetic copy Chris (Seth Green) look on. Also in the mix is genius, homicidal infant Stewie (MacFarlene) - one of the most deserving break-out characters in TV history - and Brian, the family's talking dog.If the characters sound like clichés, that's the point. MacFarlane uses them simply as vessels and with the show regurgitates every pop culture childhood memory to create a full-length parody of 70s and 80s sitcoms. Even better than a parody, a satire. Just as Archie Bunker was a product of the 50s being imposed on by a changing 70s culture, ""Family Guy"" is about the new millennial values juxtaposed on sitcom camp of the last century. In MacFarlane's world there are child molesters on ""Lost in Space"" and ""Eight is Enough"" actually refers to disciplinary beatings.Yes, ""The Simpsons"" have covered similar ground, with a particular emphasis on random flashbacks and fantasy scenes. But with ""The Simpsons"" in a creative tailspin for the last decade, MacFarlane and crew swoop in to fill this gaping void. To out-Simpson ""The Simpsons"" if you will. What MacFarlane brings to the table is pitch-perfect comic timing - an ability to know how quick to cut or how long to drag out a particular bit to get the laugh. As well as utter fearlessness. From bits in which Jesus Christ turns water ""into funk"" or a TV parody ""Gumble 2 Gumble: Beach Justice"" staring Greg and Bryant Gumble as bicycle cops, ""Guy"" isn't just one of the funniest things to grace TV, it was freakin' brilliant. This breaks from are more often like an animated version of ""The Far Side"", then ""The Simpsons"".Then it was canceled only to be renewed at the 11th hour. And then it was canceled again, brought back supposedly by strong DVD sales. But given the networks ownership of the show and how Fox beat to death the equally strong ""Futurama"", it's hard to buy that. This constant shakeup has got to take a toll on a series' rhythm. When the show returned for a 3rd season it felt lacking of something. As if the network notes to ""slow the pace"", ""tone down the fantasy scenes"" and ""thicken the story lines"" were rigidly being followed when the breaking of these rules was what made the show great in the first place. Still it contained classics like ""Emission: Impossible"", ""The Thin White Line"", ""Road to Rhode Island"" and ""Brian Wallows, Peter's Swallows"" to keep us satisfied.Upon the 2nd return, giving us seasons 4, 5 and beyond, the show has completely lost it's footing. After a LONG agonizing wait, the 4th season premiere is a disappointing ""North by Northwest""/""Passion of the Christ"" parody. The rest of the season follows suit in which only ""PTV"", the show's satire of the TV ratings system, recaptures it's prior lunacy. MacFarlane makes the crucial mistake here, actually wanting us to care about them. Given that they where envisioned as clichés in the first place, putting the weight of a story on their backs only shows how lacking the show is for character depth. Even Stewie, once a source for huge laughs, is stripped down to a single latent homosexuality joke. The show gets story heavy where it shouldn't. Slows down when it should speed up. Goes broad when it should go cult. Gets political and angry when it should be mindless escapism. ""Family Guy"" was about velocity, randomness and obscure 1% gags.I won't go as far as to say that ""Family Guy"" beyond seasons 4 and 5 is proof that a dead show should probably remain dead. But it is proof that a show can't go through constant cancellations and reshuffling and remain intact. It also suffers from the same fate that has plagued ""The Simpsons"". It is full of itself. It has become lazy in a belief that it can do no wrong in the eyes of it's fans. ""Family Guy"", in many ways, has sold out. It isn't the acerbic TV rebel it used to be. It is now part of the system itself""Guy's"" humor has a masterful ability to appeal to ""Star Trek"" nerds and drunken frat boys alike. And it is hard to deny the TV geek in my doesn't flip out when they do something half of either audience won't get like weave a ""Star Wars"" joke into a ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" reference. But the show's die-hard legions of fans (some damn near sycophantic over the show's brilliance) have allowed it to be lazy and complacent and paved the way for MacFarlane's head to slide right up his own posterior. In some ways he deserves it, the show can still be very, very funny. But the true fans out there know that it can do much, much better. * * * 1 / 5",NA,"12 August 2007"
"12","Family Guy is actually one of my favorite shows, the jokes are always a blast to hear and watch and it has one of my all time favorite cartoon characters: Stewie Griffin. A lot of hard core Simpsons fans do accuse this show of being a rip off, I agree, it's similar in some aspects, but still Family Guy is always worth the watch in my opinion. It's also a little more grown up than other cartoons, when it comes to the hard core jokes, Family Guy never disappoints, they will take the joke as far as they can go.The show is about the Griffin family: Peter, Lois, Chris, Meg, Stewie, and Brian. Peter is the head of the household, he's a bit on the slow side, loves beer, and is in love with TV. Lois is the wife and mother, she's always the one you'd want to go to with problems, but when you mess with her, she comes back with a punch! Chris is the son, very slow and stupid, but sometimes has those strange moments of very deep thoughts. Meg is the daughter who just can't be noticed and is finding herself in the harsh world of high school. Stewie, the baby, is a wanna be dictator, wants to kill Lois, will destroy broccoli, kill he man in white, and is always looking for victory to be his! Brian is a man stuck in a dog's body who loves Lois and is trying to figure out why he's with the Griffin Family.Family Guy has some extremely funny episodes, for me the most memorable are: Chitty Chitty Death Bang, Emission Impossible, A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas, and 8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter. Those are the episodes that just always can get a constant laugh from me. But I do recommend Family Guy, it's not for the faint of heart, but it's just a fun show if you want a few good laughs. The cast loves doing this show and they always pull in great and memorable characters. While I still prefer The Simpsons, Family Guy is also a show that I will always watch when I get the chance.",NA,"24 November 2003"
"13","Family Guy truly shows what the limits were at the time but it's through pushing the limits that they show our growth as a human race as a whole. Their jokes range anywhere from a fart joke to jokes about quantum physics (that you won't get unless you know quantum physics). It has reigned on TV for over 20 years and though, now, the older episodes could be considered ""inappropriate or ignorant"" they usually have a deeper meaning than what we see first. This show can work as pointless viewing or background noise and it can be broken down to a deep depth of life lessons.","10","25 July 2021"
"14","I cannot even begin to discuss how ridiculously smart and outrageously funny is this show. Not only does this program far surpass most of the comedies on television, it has the guts to hit topics that most of the overly sensitive public shies away from. I never understood why it was taken off the air in the first place. Fox can show something as tawdry and humanly degrading as Temptation Island, but Family Guy was too racy? Riiiight.I absolutely must comment on the incredible voice talent done for this show, most especially the amazing creator himself, Seth MacFarlane. First of all, his versatility is unlike anything I have ever heard. When I discovered how many voices he actually performed, I was floored. I am currently receiving my masters in speech pathology so I find his ability particularly interesting. Not only can he speak in these individual voices, he can sing in them, and very well I might add.The musical numbers in this cartoon revive a dying art. The ""Road"" episodes are a hysterical throw back to the Crosby/Hope movies, which is a reference I usually have to explain to my friends though they often must explain a few that I miss. In fact, the scope of the references range from cheesy 80's TV to political commentary to Broadway. This is why everyone will find something funny about this show. Everyone in one form or another can relate to it.Most of my guy friends think I should be offended by the show because I am a woman and this is a ""guy's show."" Let me tell you, this is not the case at all. Lois Griffin is a freakin role model. I like to think I have half of her savvy when dealing with my ignorant boyfriends.Absolutely excellent television. Edgy, funny, intelligent and extremely creative. This show was a breath of fresh air for mundane television and will soon awaken the network again. Seth MacFarlane, you are a genius!!",NA,"28 February 2005"
"15","I started watching ""Family Guy"" right after it premiered after the Super Bowl back in 1999. I immediately fell in love with it and thought it was hilarious. ""Family Guy"" is about the Griffin family who live in Rhode Island. Peter Griffin is the father of the family and not very bright. He usually says wrong things in the wrong time. Lois is the mother of the family and smarter than Peter. Meg is the daughter of the family and she tries to avoid her family from making her look uncool and goes through teen problems. Chris is the son who loves to eat and is also not very bright. Stewie is the baby who tries to kill his family and take over the world. Brian, the dog, is the voice of reason in the family but also an alcoholic. ""Family Guy"" has many great episodes. My favorites include ""Road to Rhode Island"", ""Peter, Peter Cavier Eater"", and ""Mr. Saturday Knight"". I am glad new episodes are coming next year! This show deserves 10/10 stars!","10","2 August 2004"
"16","I love family guy it's one of my favorite shows I liked the older seasons of this show more because it was more funnier than the newer seasons my favorite seasons are 1-5 but I still love the rest of the seasons my favorite episode is Brian in love my favorite character is stewie one thing I didn't like is they changed the character personality but overall great and funny show 8.8/10.","9","7 January 2022"
"17","The best animated series ever! Family Guy is the best Fox television animation. The design of this animation is fantastic The Quahog city in Rhode Island and the events that take place there are really fascinating. Making such an engaging animation and its success after all these years shows that the job has been done right. Peter, Lois, Meg, Chris, Stewie and Brian Griffin and all their friends like Glenn, Joe and the rest and the whole town are really fascinating and everyone has their own story and the designer worked on their character. This is not a fantasy animation, but Stewie and Brian work together on the fantasy part. I like it after all these years.","10","30 November 2020"
"18","Family Guy is another of the best TV-shows that premiered in 1999! Family Guy kind of reminded me of The Simpsons a little bit but there both different. The way Family Guy is like The Simpsons is that they both have the same plot which is a sit-com about a dysfunctional family that lives in a medium sized town where anything can happen and plus the humor is slapstick. Peter Griffin (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) does his best to do what's right for the family, but along the way, he makes mistakes that are the stuff of legends and he is the not so bright one in the family, he speaks before he thinks which is hilarious. Then there's Lois (voiced by Alex Borstein) who is the most sane of the bunch. There is the two teenagers of the family Meg (Season 1 was voiced by Lacey Chabert and then Season 2 and beyond Mila Kunis did the voice of Meg) who is one of those kids who tries so hard to fit in but yet it doesn't work and I feel so sorry for her and then there's Chris (voiced by Seth Green) who is fat, not really that smart but yet spirited and kind of weird. Then there's Stewie (voiced by Seth MacFarlane, again), the evil baby who has an English accent and is this evil genius who wants to take over the world and then there is Brian the dog (voiced by Seth MacFarlane, again), who is the smartest in the family and likes to drink and smoke and doesn't really describe himself as a domestic animal and is trying to find his purpose. The show is so funny because it also makes fun of several movies and other TV-shows which is another thing Family Guy and The Simpsons are alike! The other characters in the show are Cleveland (voiced by Mike Henry) who is this all-around nice guy; Joe Swanson (voiced by Patrick Warburton) who is this tough guy who is in a wheel-chair because he paralyzed his legs and he mainly uses his upper-body strength and then there is Quagmire who is this sex-maniac who goes crazy for any woman that is sexy and I like the way Quagmire says ""Alright!"" and I say it the way he would said it now. Plus Adam West is in Family Guy playing the Mayor of Quahog, himself and Seth MacFarlane also worked with Adam West when MacFarlane was working in Hanna-Barbera! It premiered back in 1999 after the 1999 Super Bowl where the Denver Broncos won! Then in 2002 FOX canceled this series and then Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block came along and picked up the series for re-runs and then TBS and now it is going to make a return on FOX! You can get this series out on DVD too!User Rating: 9/10BOTTOM LINE: HILARIOUS AND A BIT LIKE THE SIMPSONS BUT DIFFERENT!",NA,"26 July 2004"

"21","This could have been great. The voice-overs are exactly right and fit the characters to a T. One small problem though; the look of the characters, mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same. The same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as hairlines or weight size. It looks kind of odd to see a really big guest star's voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here. If I am not mistaken Kathy Griffin did a voice-over for this show and it looked too odd to be funny.There is a few other problems, one being the family plot. The Simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into. Here we get too much annoying diversions, like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off. As you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more ""Married with Children"".If I should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is it's repetitiveness. Peter Griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others. Lois should have been named Lois Lame because she is sort of one-dimensional. Seth Green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the show.So what more can I say. There isn't exactly anything wrong with this show but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the Simpsons has done for almost two decades.","4","3 June 2006"
"22","Family Guy used to be the best show on air in its prime years filled with great comedy and stories that the Griffin family goes through. Now the characters are all self aware every episode and doesn't entertain me very well.I used to love watching Family Guy, and I still do. However, it's gotten very lazy and all around bad with the writing now. Seasons 1-6 were filled with great stories and the characters weren't blown out of proportion like they are now. In this season it just seems boring and depressing compared to the older episodes. I'll give it slack due to the fact that the show has been running for almost 20 years, but I think the show has ran its course.The only positive I can really take from the later seasons is the attention to real world issues This is a good thing that they are spreading awareness about these topics, however they don't do it in an entertaining and funny way that they used to be able to.An example of this is the episode ""Thin White Line"", it's about Brian becoming addicted to cocaine and shows the spiral down that he takes from the effects of it. Seasons one through four were easily my favorite seasons to watch because they were clever, entertaining and the characters were relatable.The episodes from around season nine and below are the best ones and are a must watch. Seasons 10-14 were okay, I guess. Season 16 was better than 10-14 and I thought they were going to take a turn back to what they used to do, but season 17 came along a destroyed that hope.","10","7 May 2019"
"23","It was 8 years ago that I wrote a review on Family Guy. I thought better to start fresh than to update it. Thankfully the show has lasted all of these years and is making some crazy episodes. The show becomes more and more daring, but I think unlike when it first came around we are not surprised to see what this show does. Imagine all those years ago when Family Guy was canceled if it was not brought back. That would have been a sad affair. This show is exciting and edgy and I love it. I do understand that kids tend to watch shows like this because it is a cartoon and it is not appropriate for children. We are in a different age and for many years (thanks to shows like the Simpsons) cartoons are not just for kids. Some are for adults.Enjoy.","10","30 September 2009"
"24","Family guy seems to have consistent disturbing, confusing, outrageous plots that make me feel like it's horrible.However I start finding myself laughing over it too pretty consistently for some reason.The other poorly done cartoons that don't even last a season seem to be disturbing, confusing and outrageous without any funny things in there!I used to hate this until watching a bunch of poorly done adult cartoons that didn't even survive one season.","7","13 February 2022"

I hate Seth, he's the one writing this junk that for some reason idiots enjoy!!

"29","(spoiler) In 1999, Fox aired quite possibly the worst series ever to grace television, a horrible little show named Family Guy. It had ugly, rigid animation, and stale, unfunny, and extremely repetitive jokes. Repetitive in how, you would ask? Well, the jokes either came in one of two kinds...1. They would try to make the lazy, ugly as sin father, Peter Griffin, a man with the most ANNOYING voice in history(so annoying I would love to take some scissors to his throat to shut him up) as much of a jerk as possible, for example, one episode he makes fun of a guy for being sad that his mom died(HYSTERICAL!). Repeat to death. Oh, yeah, real funny. I'm practically dying from laughter right now.2. They randomly take a popular fictional character, such as Spider-man, or Mickey Mouse, or Indiana Jones or someone randomly pop up. Then, they repeatedly do this to fill in a full half-hour. Ohhhh, INCREDIBLY funny. Okay, there is occasionally...3. Something where they just do something completely offensive. One episode I did unfortunately watch had them completely portraying Walt Disney as a sick, perverted sleaze ball. I'm sorry, but that is completely rude and disrespectful, and especially out of line for creator(and voice of about 91% of the cast) Seth MacFarlane. After all, if it wasn't for animation innovators like Walt Disney, Seth would probably be stuck in some dead-end job.This sorry excuse for a series was horrible, with the laziest writing I have ever seen for a TV show(no, I am not counting reality TV). This series was a complete piece of crap. Apparently, FOX FINALLY realized this, and canceled it in 2001. While still hardly perfect, it was at least one actually intelligent move they made. Three years later, some moron apparently decided to bring this abomination back. Why!? Why must FOX destroy the rest of their respect(although, why should I care?)? I guess they must only be happy if they're showing piles of puke that try to pass themselves off as TV shows, since they went out of their way to put Family Guy back on the air. What can I say? This has to be FOX's worst mistake since canceling Firefly, or Futurama(then again though, at least that kept the show from growing stale, unlike the Simpsons, which has now become arguably worse than even Family Guy). Well, I hope for their sake FOX realizes what a stupid mistake they're making. Somehow though, I severely doubt it.",NA,"29 December 2004"

"38","""Family Guy"" perhaps doesn't have the wit, political undertones, and all-in satire of counterparts such as ""South Park"". But it is truly entertaining and funny nonetheless. Its ""everything goes"" mentality in terms of humor is something that makes the show unpredictable and original, and while many find the cutaway gags unimaginative, I think it makes it stand out from the other animated adult comedies out there. While ""The Simpsons"" feels as relevant as ""Married... With Children"" (not saying that they suck), ""Family Guy""'s smaller yet crazy character gallery and talented cast makes the series stay topical, interesting and hysterically fun.","8","22 July 2019"
"39","Shame on Fox for mishandling this show! As with ""Futurama"", scheduling problems made this show impossible to find on a regular basis. But it was worth hunting down - this show is funny, surreal, and offensive. Wittier than South Park (and more un-PC, too) and more original plots than The Simpsons, this show is hysterical. This show is also primarily for twentysomething kids who can ""get"" the references to Big League Chew, Kool-Aid, and that episode of ""Who's the Boss?"" where Tony sees Angela naked in the shower. I could tell this show was scripted by people my age, and that made it even cooler to me. I can't wait to own all of the episodes on DVD. Watch it on Cartoon Network as part of their Adult Swim line-up if you're uncertain, but you'd have to be crazy not to love this show.",NA,"15 April 2003"
"40","Well, Family Guy has garnered my attention, until recent years.Like many shows, it has taken a serious dip in quality. I found the more recent episodes/seasons have been more political, and less about the characters.I remember watching a recent episode, and then watching the very first episode, 'Death has a Shadow'... Did I then realize that the show isn't once what it was...I loved the earlier seasons, as it was Family Guy the way it was meant to be... Offensive, disgusting, crude, you name it. This show has taken a step away from that, and that was the very thing I loved about the show.Don't get me wrong, there a couple good episodes in the newer seasons, such as 'Road to Multiverse', or 'Back to the Pilot', but I wish the newer seasons were more consistent in good content, such as the latter and/or the former.As a Family Guy fan, I recommend only watching up to season 4. Anything past season 4 is where the quality takes a dive.The first 4 seasons are pure comedy gold.Regardless of the lackluster quality in newer seasons, my thoughts in seasons 1-4 are that the show is fantastic. It is the reason why I give this a show a watch, and a high rating. The characters are so crude, and humorous, that I remember almost losing my breath, since I would laugh so much.The parts that 'kill' me, are when Peter would have flashbacks or made up thoughts in his head about prospects of his life... Pure genius.If you are a person that wants to watch this, again, I would only watch up to the end of season 4. Past that is mostly irrelevant.","7","24 January 2015"
"41","This is the greatest show ever made next to south park. I love this show! it is so funny, and Peter's laugh is hilarious. You need to watch this show right away for the few people who have never seen this show before. One of my favorite shows of all time.If you can, try to see some of the later episodes such as I dream of Jesus, or Tales of a third grade nothing. But there's never been an episode I didn't like.

Ya Wright Oh my GOD FAMILY GUY KILLS THE SIMPSONS. Ok I don't MIND THE SIMPSONS Bart is Pretty Cool.
But Family Guy is Crazy, Insane, off the Wall the baby is Nuts. The Dog is a Lover, The Daughter is Pretty Groose, The Son is Weird, Daddy is not to Bright, Mommy is Hot Lol. The Police man is in a Wheelchair, The man in the neighborhood is a Perfect, ( and his Daddy is a Woman)

"44","While I know that I run the risk of being chased out of town for saying this, I feel that since the beginning of Season 5, the show has lost its edge.90% of the jokes in ""Family Guy"" fall into one of 3 categories: 1) Jokes making fun of pop culture (especially old TV shows and celebrities) 2) Gags that run so long that they become absurd 3) Flashbacks, most of the time introduced with ""This is more ___ than that time I ___""I'm sure that a lot of people find this stuff funny, but after 4 seasons with this kind of humour, it just becomes so expected that it ends up being routine. This doesn't do it for me.I still like this show and I think it has a lot of potential, but it needs some new ideas!","6","26 September 2005"
"45","There are people who love this show, fair enough. I am not saying you are stupid for liking Family Guy, for that would make me very heartless, but I am really sorry, but I could never get into the show. Don't get me wrong I love animation, I grew up on animated shows from the 80s and 90s, I still watch Disney and I love The Simpsons(before it jumped the shark that is) and Futurama, because they were fun and original. The first thing I don't like about Family Guy is that it is neither funny or original. Some of the plot lines are recycled from some of the weaker plot lines from the Simpsons, and the jokes here range from unfunny to inappropriate and also are repeated to the point of boredom, flashbacks that are just as repetitive and to top it off pop culture references that just don't work. Instead of raising an eyebrow or laughing until my sides were sore, I found myself wincing. Maybe it is because I am not into this kind of humour,and sometimes Family Guy overdoes the controversial side of things so much that even that gets tiresome. Peter I think replaces Homer as the stupidest dad on animated show television, he can't do anything right, he is slow and obnoxious and he loves television and beer(sound familiar?). Also his antics are unfunny and predictable. Lois is really shallow and dull and a mother figure that I can't really relate to, Meg like Lois is dull, Chris has his moments but is almost as obnoxious and as unlikeable as Peter. In fact the only likable characters are Stewie and Brian, but Stewie often has motives that are really quite absurd. The musical numbers in my opinion are okay at best, lifeless at worst, very often they are nothing to rave about. The only redeeming qualities for me really other than Stewie and Brian are the wonderful, detailed animation and various vocal performances with Seth McFarlane being the best. Overall though, I don't like it, I just can't get into it. 2/10 Bethany Cox","2","27 April 2010"
"46","Everyone likes a little bit dark humor now & then. Family guy gave me the jokes others Won't dare to air. That's what makes the show funny .","10","4 September 2020"
"47","When Family Guy first premiered, I was not in a discriminating mood. With the 1990s containing a wealth of clever, surreal cartoons, why should I be? Nickelodeon produced Doug; Ren and Stimpy and Rockos Modern Life among other fine cartoons(Yes, this includes Spongebob).All had quirky, dreamlike animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialog. The Simpsons became an outright phenomenon, perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest defenders claim it to be, but a very fine investment of your time and certainly dismisses the false axiom that all TV is junk. South Park started out as a crude but hilarious attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire underneath. It evolved to become a Monty Python- esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally swift and sharp societal critiques(Such as their defense of the noble underpants gnomes) and eventually settled to be entirely self referential and ""meta"" like the Simpsons did, and has unfortunately jumped the shark. Family Guy is superficially like The Simpsons and South Park. It pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts. However, what it has in loquacity it lacks in true wit.The show is famous for its use of gimmicks, especially for flashbacks. Many are references to bad TV sitcoms or commercials. Some are funny(Especially from the first two seasons), most are not. Are references inherently funny? I'm not sure, but they are mostly what the show stands on considering that its characters are painfully uninteresting. Where Homer and Bart have charm, and Cartman has an artillery of self awareness and pure outrageousness to back up his awful behavior, Peter Griffin has no excuse. He's just a loud, obnoxious pig. Anything funny coming from his character is only because the writers forget how to be unfunny that day. Lois is also very shallow and dull; Meg is a prop, only to be abused; Chris is borderline retarded and only occasionally funny, and the two main stars of the show(Stewie and Brian) are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it all really kind of pointless.Other gimmicks I can't stand are when a character points to something obviously and lingers on it for an uncomfortably long time. This happens a lot lately, and I can't bear it any longer. Not just the oft mentioned chicken that likes to beat Peter up, I'm talking about the painful moments where they talk about pop culture and prod it as if they are alien spectators. That's not wit or even ironic humor, it's totally boring and lifeless.Not that the show can't be funny, in fact some of the earlier episodes had me rolling. Highlights include the pilot episode, where Peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious television; when Peters religious zealot father shows up and wreaks havoc; When Peter becomes a narc at Megs school, and the ""pancake"" episode. I suspect these are the episodes that accidentally incorporated actual human traits in its characters, or merely were times the writers had actual comedic inspiration.One last thing, the show is not offensive. It's only offensive to those who wouldn't watch the show in the first place, so it's almost like a circle jerk to the choir of hipsters.","4","24 March 2009"

"50","When this show came on..I had never seen such offensive animated material on basic cable..I think it does a better job in the offensive apartment then South Park did because South Park focused more on gross out humor and it's social attacks were more annoying than funny. Family Guy had me on the ground laughing..it was so morally corrupt..the use of flashback scenes were always funny. My favorite scene was when Peter as a teenager is pointing and laughing at a guy at his mother's funeral going ""haha he misses his mommy he misses his mommy"" in sing song..so cruel and funny. I am so angry that FOX jerked this show around. It kept going off and on off and on..never on a full season run..and even now I don't know if the show is cancelled cos they waited a whole full year without reruns before season 3 aired back around October..for a short period of time even though season 3 wasnt as funny..the humor toned down..it was still worthy to watch and keep on..and FOX has a real bad problem with shoving out too many crap shows and replacing the good ones..they need to cool it. Anyway a box set is out..I guess thats all I have to live on to enjoy this classic comedy",NA,"27 July 2002"
"51","Family Guy is like a poor imitation of the Simpsons except that even the Simpsons at its most extreme worst would be an eternity ahead in quality, substance and entertainment than this drivel The premise of this show mostly comes from over the top, obnoxious, overly crude, insulting and idiotic humor which should not even be entertaining to a two year old. Additionally most of the jokes and popular culture references and parodies aren't even funny -Mr McFarlane and his cohorts really need to take a look at how the Simpsons spoof popular culture to take lessons on how do it right.The only two characters who are even remotely entertaining on this show are Brian and Lois. Peter is mostly an obnoxious, unfunny buffoon with no entertainment value whatsoever, Meg is absolutely annoying and Stewie has his moments but they are few and far between. The rest of the supporting characters and cast -with the possible exception of the late Diane Simmons -are as equally annoying and irritating. Put together with the unfunny drivel that seems to pass for humor on this show, I can't understand why anyone finds this funny. To each his own I guess.This is to be avoided like the plague and is a sad indication of what the state of modern television has declined to","1","31 January 2011"

"53","I've said much of this on ""Jump The Shark,"" but Family Guy is definitely a show full of hills and valleys, but for some of us, the hills are more than worth the valleys. For a ""low-brow"" comedy, it often seems to go out of its way to AVOID a low-brow joke, especially a really well-worn one. For instance, it often has little old ladies and ""trailer park"" type women, without those lame, lame ""hirsute woman"" jokes. (I'd like to see more than a tiny number of ""Patty and Selma"" scenes on The Simpsons do without those!) and there was the episode where Brian makes friends with the elderly woman. Instead of a lot of worn-out geriatric jokes, they made it a sort of comedy-drama! And in the ""Asiantown"" episode (which was kind of hit and miss), there were a lot of jokes of Asian food, without one of those cat and dog ones (you know the ones I mean), in spite of the fact that a MAIN CHARACTER is a dog! I know these are irritating things that Family Guy DOESN'T do, but there are so many funny things it DOES do. The religious jokes (not SO much in the current version as the first one) can be genuinely clever. Where else can you see Jesus looking embarrassed because he got credit for a miracle performed by an Indian god standing next to him? (The jokes about religion on countless other comedies - yes, including The Simpsons - get so ""preachy"" in THEIR OWN right, instead of being ""nonsensicle"" like that.) And then there are the movie and TV parodies, like ""Homicide : Life On Sesame Street."" And most recently, the ""Brokeback Mountain"" one. The current version, unfortunately, has too many unfunny medical jokes (regardless of whether they're in bad taste), and too many gross-out jokes (in spite of what I mentioned earlier), but the good moments still easily outweigh those, for me at least. I could go on and on.","8","22 February 2007"

"56","Family Guy revolves around the adventures of Peter Griffin & his family which consists of his wife, Lois Griffin, kids, Meg, Chris & Stewie Griffin & their anthropomorphic dog, Brian. The Griffin family is an extremely dysfunctional family. However, they are hilarious! They create so many embarrassing situations in everyday life! Another important part of Family Guy is the occasional flashbacks in each episode. It's when a character mentions the incident & they show it after that. Peter is a very stupid man with an IQ of maximum 10. Peter usually hangs out at the bar with his friends Joe Swanson, Glenn Quagmire & Cleveland Brown. Peter's friends are really funny. Especially the extremely horny & perverted Quagmire! Lois is Peter's doting & loving wife. Occasionally though, she gets very irritated with Peter's stupidity. Lois' charm lies in her annoying nasal voice & how her plans to keep the family normal always fail! Meg Griffin is Peter's daughter & the eldest of the Griffin kids. Peter & the rest of the family(mostly Peter though) don't like Meg because of her unattractive appearance. She's fat, wears glasses & got Peter's looks instead of Lois'. This is what makes Meg amusing. The best part is when Peter punches her in the face or says ""Shut up Meg."" Epic stuff! Chris Griffin, Peter's first son, is stupider than his father. This is what makes Chris so funny. Stewie Griffin, is my second most favorite character after Peter. The youngest of the Griffin kids, Stewie has an extremely advanced intellect & can speak surprisingly fluently for his age(2 or 3). He also doesn't like his family much especially his mother Lois. The reason to his hatred for Lois is never given. However, all these attributes is what makes Stewie so epically hilarious! Not to mention his British accent & football shaped head! Brian is an intelligent talking dog who usually doesn't bother about the abnormality of his masters. He just goes with the flow & helps them when he can. He is also very nonchalant. All these factors make Brian tick in the comedic aspect.Seth Macfarlane has done an outstanding job in his creation, Family Guy. Macfarlane also provides his voice to three of the main characters. They are Peter, Stewie & Brian. He also provides his voice to the brilliant Quagmire. The multi talented Macfarlane, has done a spectacular job in modifying his voice for each character. The voice of Brian, being his own. Alex Bornstein has done a brilliant job in her voice over of Lois. Seth Green has done a magical job by changing his voice substantially for his voice over of Chris. Mila Kunis has done a good job in her voice over of Meg. A special mention should be given to Patrick Warburton. He's done a mind blowing job in his voice over of Peter's buddy, Joe. Seth Macfarlane has given us a perfect cartoon adult comedy! Everyone will love it! I'd recommend that you watch it immediately, after reading this review!","10","24 April 2012"
"57","Family Guy isn't that complex. It's a silly show about a family that mocks pretty much everything. It's humor mixes sitcom style and semi sketches in, and it's the best show ever. Whenever you have a horrible day, or just bored in general, family guy is there for you. It's some of the funniest writing on tv, it's dumb while also being smart. Tv is meant to bring entertainment, and in my opinion no tv show does it better than family guy. It's so creative with how it makes fun of things, while also showing love to these things. With over 20 years on its belt, it's had its ups and downs. But in its prime, it's unbeatable, Best. Show. Ever.","10","5 May 2021"

"60","""FAMILY GUY,"" in my opinion, is an absolute FOX classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoy it. It's hard to say which episode is my favorite. However, I think it's always funny when a mishap occurs. I always laughed at that. It's nice that every main character has stayed with the show throughout its entire run so far. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gives a good performance, the setting is spectacular, everything about the characters is well-done, and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, although it can also be seen in syndication now, I hope this show will always live on in syndication when it finishes its run on FOX.","9","1 August 2006"

"62","The reason I say that this show WAS great is because it was. I don't know what happened over the years but the show that was really funny is simply not funny anymore. I still gave this show 9 stars though because of how great those earlier seasons really were. Throughout the early 2000s this show was one of the funniest shows I have ever seen, hands down. Yes, it is also wickedly offensive but people take things way too seriously these days. People need to just take a joke. It's not like people who watch the show will start acting like this in real life, jeez. But beyond that, I loved this show and still do love the earlier seasons. I can still sit down and watch an old rerun and have a good laugh. This show was stupid, creative and offensive, but all those things made the show that much better. If you haven't seen the show for some reason this is the plot, it is about a dysfunctional family living in the town of Quahog, New England. These are the characters:Peter: The dim witted father who is actually just a moron, but deep down he wants to do the right thing but his stupidity get him in trouble too often. He also loves beer. (He's my favourite in the show).Lois: The wife who loves Peter though often gets mad at him for his shenanigans. She also loves her youngest son Stewie. (Seems like she forgets about her other 2 kids though). She is also a daredevil and stoner deep down and misses collage because of that.Chris: The oldest son and is dumb and socially awkward so he doesn't have much friends.Meg: The daughter who is not popular in school and who nobody likes. (Not even her own family which is funny).Stewie: The 1 year old baby who nobody can understand what he says when he talks except for Brian and people outside the main family. He is evil and has an armoury and a time machine. His goal is to kill his mother and take over the world. He is also gay. Best friends with Brian too.Brian: The dog of the family who acts like a human and talks like a human but also can't help being a dog naturally. He also has a crush on Lois. Best friends with Stewie too.There are also many other characters like Cleveland, Joe, and Quagmire but it's best to leave some surprises. Overall I recommend the earlier seasons of this show to anyone (As long as you don't get offended over everything).P. S the mayor of Quahog in this show is Adam West so that's a bonus.","9","6 May 2021"

"64","I used to love this show. Back when it first came out I tried to encourage all my friends to watch it. I had a peculiar sense of pride and ownership that I had seen this show before any of my friends and got them onto it.
How sorry do I feel now that for at least the past six or seven seasons the fall from grace for this show has not just been consistent but has in my opinion been accelerating.
This obviously is only my opinion but there are fewer episodes per season that I even moderately enjoy. I used to watch every episode intently but now it's just background noise and sadly soon I fear I won't watch at all.
I suppose it's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.","7","8 January 2021"
"65","""Family Guy"" used to be funny. Despite the many similarities that this show had with ""The Simpsons"" it was entertaining to watch, anyway. But now it isn't funny anymore.All the jokes from this series were replaced with some idiotic, pointless 80s references and cutaway gags, which at first were amusing, but eventually become annoying and repetitive.None of those gags had any relevance with the actual plot from each episode, and now, instead of being funny examples of random humor became just a cheap excuse for the writers to introduce some lame cultural reference or bash the stuff that they don't like. Those cutaway gags get more and more self-indulgent and lazy as time goes by: For example, there was one cutaway ""gag"" that only consisted to show a list of celebrities Peter didn't like. Other was a long clip of Conway Twitty singing an entire song, from start to finish. To get this worse, the characters had a complete change of personalities, turning many of the once likable characters into amoral jerks without any redeeming value. At first, Peter was only dumb, now he is complete sociopath devoid of any kind of sympathy towards anyone. Lois used to be the voice of reason, now she is just as bad (If not worse) than her husband. Brian, who used to be a funny, sarcastic character now is merely one pretentious jerk which main role in the series is to shoehorn the writers beliefs in each episode. Mge changed for being a bratty teen into a punching bag which everyone hates for no apparent reason, other than being a female teen who isn't psychically attractive (Wow, what a great message) Stewie slowly changed from being an evil genius to some idiotic (and offensive) stereotype (Sometimews I wonder why they bothered to remove Jasper from the series, when Stewie is now doing exactly the same role in the recent episodes from the show)This show had lost all the charm and fun it used to have, becoming slowly one of the most self-indulgent, annoying and pretentious cartoons ever made in the whole history of television.","1","8 February 2007"
"66","Seth McFarlane's prime-time animated off-color ""Simpsons"" clone ""Family Guy"" began its life quietly on the Fox sketch show ""Mad TV"" in the late-1990s. By 1999 it burst onto the screen as a brash, clever, and often hilarious half hour show following the exploits of the Griffin family and a small cast of other Quahog, Rhode Island locals. It was strong satiric cartoon caught somewhere between the more mainstream ""Simpsons"" and the overtly crass ""South Park"", but well-deserving of its cult appeal that brought the show back into existence after two cancellations.Unfortunately the show has been a mixed bag since its return in 2005. There is something far less genuine about it, with its back-to-back heavy handed pop cultural references, over indulgence on immature bodily function humor, and frequent loss of any semblance of plot line. It seems that McFarlane buys into his hype and success so voraciously as to insult his critics within the context of the show and by allowing the show to be little more than a spotlight on his youth of too much TV watching. The show still delivers chuckles, but this is not the same show it used to be.","6","17 October 2007"
"67","I love everything about family guy.My favourite characters in family are Brian and Stewie and I like the episodes when it mainly features them such as ""Road to Rhode Island"" (Season 2), as they interact very well. The comments they make just have me in stitches. Peter's behaviour is also very funny as some of the things he does ""are just so brilliant they're retarded."" The voice acting is excellent, especially Seth MacFarlane as he provides the voices for half of the Griffin family as well as their perverted neighbour Glenn Quagmire and how he manages this range (particularly with singing) I just don't know. He deserves his two Emmy's for providing the voice of evil baby genius Stewie. Adam West also steals the show with his funny and completely insane regular character the mayor of Quahog. What I like about Chris (voiced by Seth Green) is the things he says show that he takes after his father when it comes to intelligence and common sense.The only thing I have found annoying is that in the UK Fox has decided to change the seasons to increase DVD sales, which in no way reflect the programme itself but rather the marketing.If you enjoy Family Guy then I would thoroughly recommend Seth MacFarlane's other project American Dad which uses a different style of humour but is still extremely hilarious.",NA,"25 March 2007"
"68","This show is awesome.  It better not be a replacement of the Simpsons though.  Peter Griffin is just straight out stupid, and its funny.  Brian is really sarcastic which makes him funny, and Stewie is just the best character on the show.  Always trying to kill Lois, in various of ways.

"69","Family Guy is without a shadow of a doubt an intriguing, funny, and unique experience every week it is aired. This television series has survived through adversity and overcame challenges after being canceled twice and brought back.The humour of Family Guy is definitely something the future will call ""family guy humour"" it's random off the wall antics generally focus on priceless flashback sequences and stammering over awkward sentences to keep you laughing. The once very promising series is beginning to wear down however as season 5 was full of very dull and humourless episodes and i believe it is because of Ricky Blitt temporarily leaving the show to do The Winner which coincidentally flopped. Seasons 1-4 have been as pleasure and the first six or so episodes of Season 5 as well but only time will tell if this series stays as consistently funny as it's almost always been.Many criticize it and claim it as a Simpsons rip off which is totally inaccurate and unfair. Homer Simpson is a dim witted easy angered character while Peter Griffin is a pop culture obsessed moron who always means well. Marge Simpson is an intelligent, nagging, wife while Lois Griffin is a good hearted mother whose party girl side is always emerging. Bart Simpson is a little hell-raiser who loves to cause trouble and pull pranks while Chris Griffin is a slow, dopey, lummox. Lisa Simpson is an intelligent, kind, liberal while Meg Griffin is a self pitying, neglected, border line suicidal loser. Maggie Simpson doesn't speak or do much throughout the show while Stewie Griffin is a quick witted baby bent on world domination with a lot of homosexual tendencies. The shows are very different and share few similarities.The show revolves around family and the struggles and over the top things that occur throughout their daily lives. The humour is totally random with irrelevant and hysterical flashback sequences occurring throughout the episode and contains a ton of satire that is both offensive and true.Seth MacFarlane reminds me of Quentin Tarantino with the way he pays homage to things he loved or remembers growing up and the pop culture references will make you think ""oh yeah i remember that"". I believe Family Guy will become a classic and in my personal opinion already has but i see a very sunny future for this great animated series. Watch out for it in the fall of 2007 as it enters it's sixth season with Ricky Blitt back on board.","9","25 July 2007"
"70","I stopped watching TV regularly around 2002 because I thought it was, with rare exceptions like the Discovery channel, stupid and trying to push agendas I didn't agree with. Every once in a while I tune back in to see what people are filling their heads with, and every time I do, I'm usually more appalled. Family Guy is a good example of this.My disgust with this show isn't even that it's not funny. It actually IS kind of funny sometimes. I laughed when Stewie followed a fat guy with a tuba, even if it was a stupid flashback that had nothing to do with the rest of the story.I don't dislike this show exactly because of its lame and uninspired artwork either, even though the white-brown-drab green-maroon color palette is as fun to look at as watching paint dry. The animation sucks too, but so does the animation in Aqua Teen Hunger Force, which I really like.What I hate about this show is that all its details add up to this very specific, mean-spirited, and juvenile sense of humor and aesthetics that I just do not identify with. There's no beauty in this show, no bursts of inspired animation like, say, the way Bart Simpson's face distorts when he sneezes. There seems to be no abiding message other than that it's cool to be a prick to everyone else as long as you get away with it. The fact that so many people DO identify with this makes me sad. And so does everything else that's popular right now. Nicki Minaj's ""Anaconda"" video, for instance, is straight out of Mike Judge's ""Idiocracy."" There's not even a pretense of substance there.","1","30 October 2014"

"73","Just ignore the haters (South Park fans especially), it is one of the greatest animated shows of all time.I find that the series has never lost its novelty and continues to being funny after 20 years of airing. People on the internet complain that it overly relies on cutaway gags, especially the obnoxious and entitled South Park fanbase that often likes to throw mud at the show whenever possible. But I think that the cutaway gags are what makes the show fantastic. The cutaways usually come when you least expected and can give you a good chuckle.The detractors that comprise the majority of the South Park fan community are spoiled man-babies that think fecal humor and mindless cussing make a show ""adult orientated"", when in reality, that type of humor is for teenagers. Family Guy's humor may not be for everyone (Humor is subjective after all), but a good chunk of the public enjoys the show's humor.The constant barrage of insults and straw man attacks by haters makes this show an underrated gem. It is so far the only show to be cancelled twice and revived twice. And unlike other shows that have been uncancelled but only lasted one more season, Family Guy is currently celebrating its 20th season and is a testament of how great this show is.There has been some days when Family Guy has lost its mojo, yet again, which show hasn't? But in recent years (IMHO), Family Guy has found its magic again and even then during the dull years, there were some clever jokes. Family Guy has contributed a lot to meme culture, I mean have you seen how many meme templates use Family Guy scenes? A LOT. It is the perhaps the most memed show of all time.The detractors that dominate the discussion of Family Guy on the internet are probably sad sacks who gush over South Park's pathetic excuse of existence as an expression their immaturity and unrealistic sense of grandeur.I applaud Seth MacFarlane for not being defensive when Trey and Matt bash his show. Trey and Matt, I can tell, are thin-skinned that wouldn't like if they get a taste of their own medicine. Seth MacFarlane has incredibly thick skin and has a better attitude than those two hacks.","10","13 December 2021"
"74","I haven't seen a lot of episodes of ""Family Guy"" and it's a pretty safe bet that I won't be seeing too many in the future. Some people say to compare this show to ""The Simpsons"" is unfair. I absolutely think this show wouldn't exist if ""The Simpsons"" hadn't come first and I absolutely think it wants so very much to be ""The Simpsons"". I don't understand what's so funny about this show. In the episodes that I've watched, I've understood where they've WANTED me to laugh, I understand that someone thinks a joke was just told but the joke isn't funny. I find the whole show to be lazy: the title, the ""jokes"", there is a complete lack of inspiration throughout.The best shows on television (cartoon or not) are created like this: a script is written, it goes through several rewrites, stuff that doesn't work is taken out, inspiration is sparked, good stuff is added, there are more rewrites and then it is filmed.I picture a ""Family Guy"" episode to be created like this: a script is written and it's filmed.","1","9 January 2006"

"80","This is the strange show that could. I wanted it back on the air as much as anyone else back in '04. Seth McFarlane's cartoon can be entertaining at times, and he does feature some very interesting characters, which may help attest to this show's longevity. Sexy and free-spirited Lois and intelligent yet alcoholic Brian are the show's most interesting characters. Stewie is ultimately a very gimmicky character, seeing as he's some sort of evil genius with an inexplicable matricidal bent. Stewie's mellowed out in later years, but he still seems like a character with a tritely-developed personality. Yes, ""Family Guy"" can be very funny, but that's when the show isn't focusing on ""the family guy"", Peter Griffin. This loutish character is the most annoying, unfunny cartoon character ever created: a destructive, self-centered moron without the charm of Homer Simpson. The Peter-centered jokes are seldom funny. Sometimes I just don't get why the writers think some gimmicks are funny, such as the joke where Peter fights the giant chicken, or when he lurches in pain for 40 seconds after he stubs his toe.""South Park"" hit the nail on the head when it mocked one of ""Family Guy's"" trademarks: anachronistic '70s and '80s references. Sure, I get misty-eyed when I see a ""He-Man"" reference thrown in now and then, but 8,000 times throughout the series? Who the hell is McFarlane targeting the show to? Its raunchy humor is for the 13-30 crowd, but some young people will not get the anachronistic references to ""Simon and Simon"" or Karen Black, all boomer or Generation X references; in other words, references only those over 40 would appreciate. Even then, it's been eons since Karen Black's been relevant, so why bother even mentioning her in a show targeted for those under 40? McFarlane and his writers are some weird guys! Also, the ""Time Out for Timor"" (circa 1980) and ""Eight is Enough"" (also circa 1980) references are irrelevant to the plot and do not move the storyline forward. Again, this may be alright if the show doesn't feature any characters, but allegedly ""Family Guy"" is supposed to be about the Griffins. The nonsequiturs are not character-based references, and this makes the characters themselves irrelevant to the overall humor. What's the point of developing interesting characters when you have nonsequiturs all around to generate laughs? It's ultimately a lazy gimmick the ""Family Guy"" writers should focus less on. A little more character development would be nice.Stop with the '70s pop culture references! Even I'm too young to care about that stuff! More Lois and Brian-focused stories would be cool. Featuring less of Peter's unfunny stupidity would be even better. Overall, the show's good, but not great. Watch it, and enjoy the treat the manatees have written for you.","6","5 January 2009"
"81","I am pretty fresh in watching 'Family Guy'. I decided to watch it because many of my friends like it a lot, and I was curious to see if it was so funny as they told me. I downloaded all the seasons, and until now I watched until season 3.I see many people complaining that the last seasons are repetitive and unfunny, but I didn't finish to watch, so I cannot give an opinion about that yet. (But I hope this is not true.)My opinion is that it is a funny TV series, not the best, but does the job of entertaining while we are in the middle of a boring afternoon. Of course, there are episodes there are very retarded, and others that are very funny, but in general it is cool. People who are very sensible or doesn't like dark/black humor will probably not enjoy,since there are many sick moments. (Notably, many of them are with Meg. In some episodes I really feel sorry for her.)","6","15 June 2009"
"82","Family Guy is like The Simpsons because it has a dumb father, a nagging wife, and three kids, but way funnier. Its cutaway gags make me crack up, the lines are pretty funny too. I really enjoyed the episode "" I dream of Jesus"" where Peter is obsessed with the song ""Surfin' Bird"". Its just brilliant. I'm giving it 8 stars because some of the jokes may make me a little uncomfortable at times. It also has gone downhill but its still better than Modern Simpsons.",NA,"19 June 2019"
"83","'Family Guy' is my all time favorite show. But I'm going to admit that the family does bear some personality resemblances to 'The Simpsons' especially mom and dad Peter (Seth MacFarlane) and Lois (Alex Borstein) but when you get past these obvious comparisons, 'Family Guy' is a brilliant show on it's own. Sure, it has toilet humour but that's paid off with a very smart joke soon after. Although on the outside it may look stupid, like the show 'Jackass' the brains behind it are smart and this show especially is the wittiest of satires. The story of this show is the seemingly normal Griffin family. Father Peter is a loud mouthed idiot (Even more so than infamous Homer Simpson) who's racist, sexist and increasingly vulgar. His wife Lois is just trying to relax among all the madness and dreams of becoming a famous piano player. The youngest in the family is adorable baby Stewie (Seth MacFarlane again) who is rather vulgar, speaks with a comical accent and is planning to kill his mother and rule the world. Their son Chris (Seth Green) is, like his father, potty mouthed and has an intense fascination with the opposite sex yet he seems to be very child like underneath and always tries to proves that there's an evil monkey operating in his closet. Daughter Meg (Lacy Chabert) is slightly smarter but hates her family and is the biggest geek in class. To top it off we have talking dog Brian (Seth MacFarlane... yet again) who is the smartest in the family but does get a bit drunk once in a while. Add to that, the former Batman Adam West as a neurotic Mayor who's convinced people are stealing his water in the sink and a whole town filled with dim wits and strange faces including the violent news anchors Tom and Diane. What does that give you? 'Family Guy' of course! Seth MacFarlane is mainly to thank for creating such an accomplished show. The humour is always to do with the moment and there are frequent parodies of current events. Sadly, this show was cancelled way too early mainly because Fox was always changing air dates and never gave it a proper time slot causing it to fade off the radar but as the sales of the new DVD have proved (Most stores were sold out on the first day), there is a huge audience for 'Family Guy' and, as of late, creator MacFarlane has hinted that we may see a big screen adventure in a few years time. R.I.P. Family Guy!",NA,"25 May 2003"
"84","This show has been running since 1999, Peter and the griffin family shenanigans always being laughs. Sure the jokes are nasty and offensive but the humor is top notch and if you want an animated show just to get great laughs off of every episode then I highly recommend this show. The humor is done just right and the skits don't last long to make it seem like it tried to hard to be funny. Just watch Seth MacFarlane's golden work and see it for yourself. If you can't get into it, skip it and find another show.

"86","I've watched this show a few times, at least I've tried. Most people I know always go on about how good the show is & how I must watch it, but it really is too painful to watch. Family Guy began to air when The Simpsons 'Golden Age' was just coming to an end, and it was cancelled shortly after. If only it had stayed that way. Family Guy brainwashed people and they began to think the show was actually funny, I feel sorry for them. First of all, the characters are enough to stop me watching the show. Peter & Stewie Griffin, have the most annoying voices on TV, along with every other character in the show. They are not lovable in any way. As most people would have noticed, the family have a striking resemblance to The Simpsons family and I think the cover that was shown on the front of Mad Magazine speaks for it's self. The concept of the show is pointless. It's unfunny, offensive, insulting, crude, mean-spirited and it's wrong. There is nothing wrong with crude, crude can sometimes be good, but there is limits & Family Guy ignores those limits and takes it too far. I remember switching an episode on and it was making fun of people with Down's Syndrome. That just physically made me sick.In conclusion, Family Guy is indeed the worst show I have ever laid eyes on. If you are a brain-dead idiot, with the mind of a 7 year old, who still laughs at 'naughty words', then I recommend this show, otherwise, please avoid it. 1/10. (and that's being generous.)","1","23 June 2009"

I think he should be the main star of the show. This show definitely gives the amount of laughs a half hour should give but please don't substitute it for The Simpsons.",NA,"31 January 1999"
"96","One might expect I'd find no entertainment in this show; I don't like bathroom humour and I think cultural references often get dated. Family Guy has a lot of both those things. For example, a fart joke is pretty much all there is to it to the conclusion of the episode The King is Dead; and the show regularly parodies commercials from ten years ago. But it also has a good sense of humour about other kinds of things. Even when it's not bathroom humour, it is still shock humour, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Some thought must go into choosing what gags to use in order to amuse and shock. To this end, we have Peter pushing Lois down the stairs after she says she's not pregnant (Da Boom), we have the very twisted scene where Peter tries to breastfeed baby Stewie (I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar), and Brian the dog and Lois discussing if they'd commit bestiality if they were drunk (Brian in Love). Some of the humour targets racists, sexists, religious fanatics (Chitty Chitty Death Bang, Holy Crap), and elitists (Peter Peter Caviar Eater)- often, worthy of being mocked.Don't get me wrong, though. While I think some thought has to go into crafting Family Guy, I don't mean the show is brilliant or complex. It is not as deep as The Simpsons. The Simpsons regularly uses the theme of family members disliking each other at times but loving each other anyway, which was clearly articulated in Lisa's Wedding (season 6). Family Guy does the same thing, but expressed in a less subtle way in Holy Crap. Family Guy is like hardcore Simpsons; it's still funny but there's a lot less heart. Family Guy would never be capable of producing an episode like Lisa's Substitute (The Simpsons) or The Sting (Futurama).In terms of the characters, many are similar to the Simpsons. Peter Griffin is a dumber, fatter version of Homer Simpson, for example. Because I take more interest in intelligent characters, the two best characters are the baby Stewie and the dog Brian, both of whom can talk. Stewie is brilliant but sadistic, evil, and perpetually angry. Is he too extreme (for example, when he tries to kill his mother)? Well, every show needs a villain, and he's much like Mr. Burns. Brian, on the other hand, is the voice of reason, much like Lisa Simpson. These two are rivals and also have good interactions, in fact getting a whole episode to themselves, Road to Rhode Island. The Simpsons rarely had Mr. Burns and Lisa interact, except for the classic episode The Old Man and the Lisa. Stewie's eulogy in Road to Rhode Island is hilariously inappropriate. An 8 out of 10 for volume 1.","8","17 August 2009"

"104","When this show first aired, it seemed like a ripoff of The Simpsons, right down to the husband, wife and three children. The main difference though, is that this show is much cruder, more cynical, and the typical story structure is completely random, and this is the key element as to why I feel this show is completely hit and miss.Family Guy is almost entirely reliant on pop culture references to shoehorn into cutaway gags, a factor that deviates from the primary story. (if you could even call it that)It seems like Seth MacFarlane's ego has reached a certain level of over-inflation, that it's almost like he just farts out an idea and throws it into the mix, regardless of how disjointed the result is.Some of the cutaway gags from the earlier seasons would occasionally get a laugh out of me, but as time has gone on, the majority of the humour is in poor taste. One key example is in the Simpsons crossover where Stewie and Bart Simpson are prank calling Moe's Tavern and Bart delivers one of his classic silly portmanteau pseudonyms, and Stewie tries to top it by simply going ""YOUR SISTER HAS BEEN RAPED!"" Is that what passes for humour? An infant telling rape jokes?The key demographic is clearly for teenage boys or immature people in general, with excessive toilet humour, sexual references and innuendos and constant references to US pop culture, which at times the core demographic would probably be too young to remember or you would be completely out of the loop as an international viewer.Occasionally this show can generate the odd chuckle, but to be completely honest, it is beyond me as to why this show is still on the air.","5","28 February 2017"

I don't want to say jokes from it because I might ruin it for you. I can't see why people hate this show. (Sarcasm)Oh yeah. This show is so ""Gay"" and stupid.

"108","I was never familiar with this Fox cartoon during its original run from 1999 to 2002, but eventually discovered reruns of it, and started watching them on a daily basis in early 2005, just a few months before its return after a three-year absence. At the time, it was probably one of my favourite shows, and when the new episodes started coming, many fans seemed disappointed by them, but I wasn't. However, for some reason, as time has gone by, I have gradually lost interest in both the old and new episodes.The Griffins are a dysfunctional family who live in Quahog, a town in Rhode Island. The parents are Peter, a dimwitted, overweight alcoholic, and Lois, who often has a hard time with Peter's uncouth ways. They have a teenage daughter named Meg, who is not popular with her peers, constantly trying to fit in with them, and is sometimes embarrassed by her family. There is also a younger teenage son in the family named Chris, who is dimwitted and overweight, like his father, and easily lured into trouble. The youngest sibling is Stewie, a possessed infant with plans for world domination! The family also owns a very smart, human-like dog named Brian, who walks on two legs and talks! Some consider ""Family Guy"" a ""Simpsons"" ripoff, but I'm going to have to disagree. The two shows have their strong resemblances, but clear differences as well. FG basically has the same family structure, and Peter and Lois are definitely a lot like Homer and Marge, usually having the same type of conflict, but ""The Simpsons"" clearly wasn't the first show with a couple like that. Chris is not a ripoff of Bart. While neither of them are very bright, Chris seems slightly less so, and unlike Bart, the Griffin boy isn't known to intentionally cause trouble. Like Lisa, Meg is an outcast, but she's definitely not as smart as the Simpson sister. Maggie Simpson has occasionally done some bizarre things, but usually behaves like a normal baby. Stewie Griffin, on the other hand, is NEVER normal. Lastly, both the Simpsons and the Griffins have a dog, but Santa's Little Helper is a realistic one, whereas Brian is more like a human in a dog suit. ""Family Guy"" is often less realistic than ""The Simpsons"" is, apart from the ""Treehouse of Horror"" episodes.With my view on the ""Simpsons""/""Family Guy"" controversy off my chest, I will now explain my problems with this show. FG is very random, but as a Monty Python fan, I obviously can't complain too much about that. However, I still don't find FG that funny. It often seems very unfocused with random flashback sequences and pop culture references thrown together. I really don't think it takes a lot of effort to come up with a lot of these gags, and I sometimes get the feeling that the writers often just throw in anything they come up with, without thinking. For example, a flashback showing Peter having sex with a rhino, and he is upset that she won't look at him! That's a work of genius?! I don't think so! I remember finding such jokes as the series of flashbacks with Peter asking questions about the penis while doing art, Cookie Monster in rehab, and Peter and Michael Moore making music with their farts extremely funny when I first saw them, but not so much when I last saw them, if at all. Now, there aren't too many episodes, if any, that I could watch with a straight face throughout, as I would sometimes smile, or even laugh, but most of the jokes do not amuse me. Words that can describe the show include raunchy, demented, offensive, and politically incorrect, but I often enjoy other comedy that all those words can be used to describe.It seems to be popular for others in the cartoon business to criticise ""Family Guy"", and some may claim that these people are just jealous because their work isn't as popular. However, I strongly resent the ""jealousy"" defence often used for various people. Let's face it, while ""The Simpsons"" is well past its prime, and has been running for way too long, it was clearly the most popular cartoon show during its heyday, and didn't seem to get a bad wrap from many other cartoonists. Regardless of how popular FG is, Seth MacFarlane and his writers seem like wannabes to me, and I'm sure they do to many in the animated cartoon business as well. Now, don't get me wrong, I respect those who disagree. I'm not going to say anything insulting about the show's fans in general, since I'm not like that, and I have relatives who are fans, but in my opinion, ""Family Guy"" is significantly overrated, and does not deserve its position as one of the most popular, if not the most popular cartoon these days.","5","22 December 2007"
"109","All Family Guy has is Jokes and flashbacks. Some flashbacks are good but they get repetitive. The jokes aren't always funny and they insult Religion and think it's hilarious. Family guy has some dumb and funny jokes and no heart in it, hardly any character and is a copy of the Simpsons. Peter=Homer, Bart=Chris, Lisa=Meg, and the Mom. It's a huge rip-off and just tried to make them better. The dog can talk, I found that OK but the baby, Stewie (a rip-off of Maggie) can talk but is dumb because he talks about sex and he wants to kill his mom. Simpsons has a lot more heart and soul and Family guy is just some jokes and flashbacks. Family Guy will never be a classic or better than the Simspons. It sacrifices everything(characters, plot etc) for jokes. The jokes are occasionally hilarious, however they get repetitive and overused. A large percentage of family guy includes something similar to this ""This was more (blank) then that time (blank).

"116","This is feces coming out of the cesspool of contemporary American (((media))).It started as a fairly entertaining series, but eventually deteriorated into a monstrosity that feeds off cultural references, has no plot, and increasingly relies on absurd violence and vulgarity to compensate for lack of imagination.You see, in the past, people would actually produce original content, be it films or TV-series. Then Family Guy came along and exploited these original works for amusement purposes. But once these references are exhausted, then what? What kind of culture produces nothing of value, and seeks nothing but cheap, brainless entertainment in the form of reference to things that were made in the past and actually had value? As the series draws ever closer to its eventual end, I expect the final episodes to consist of nothing but endless farts. And that would be a fitting image of the state of culture today.","1","30 September 2017"
"117","This is not the best animated show out there. It is a few notches under the Simpsons and Futurama (the new triumph on the network, though they don't seem to think so putting it below prime time), but a couple of notches above the PJs and the god awful King of the Hill, often the most painful show to watch on television. I can understand why people would not like this show. Its plots are almost nonsensical. Plot points occur at breakneck speed, and there are quick pauses for cheap jokes, funny flashbacks, and especially pop culture references. These pop culture references are the main reason I watch the show. The Simpsons and Futurama are abundant with them, too, but The Family Guy usually has several a minute. Perhaps you don't like that, and that's okay. I guess you could call me a bona fide geek, loving to point out the references. I love the fact that The Simpsons has parodied/referenced Citizen Kane, a film which many will call the best film of all time, about 5 different times. At least 2 whole episodes of that show were based around sections of the plot of Citizen Kane.Futurama parodies/references more recent pop culture references. I've  seen Armageddon and ID4, among others. They are often funny, but it lacks the obscurity in its references that the Simpsons has.Now there is the Family Guy. Well, its references bounce from old movies, children's literature, retro 70s camp television, Looney Toons, and especially commercials. It might not have made much sense to some viewers, but when Peter Griffin chased a sock stealing faun through the landromat drier into Narnia, I laughed hard. When Brian (the talking dog) was chasing around the Gravy Train, I laughed hard, even though the many people with whom I was watching this show (when they were laughing constantly beforehand) were totally silent. I laughed a lot when Meg was handed a bomb, it exploded, and she spontaneously had a duck bill on the other side of her head. There were a lot of episodes near the end of the first season which were just plain terrible, so I quit watching it after that. I have checked in thrice since it started its second season, and there wasn't an episode I disliked. Now I'm going to have to add it to my regular schedule. I just wish Fox would take King of the Hill away and exchange its time slot for that of Family Guy. Then, with Futurama-Family Guy-Simpsons, I'd be completely set.",NA,"24 July 2000"

"119","After viewing this show, it has not only well drawn caricatures but a machine gun pace. Often it pops out punch lines so fast that even though not every line hits the target, there are enough good ones to over whelm any clinkers.This show lampoons any & every subject. Baby Stewie is a classic type of the baby who can do do it all. The show starts with a theme setting that reminds me of first All In The Family & then a big musical number. The humor is so good, that early on it even lampooned the Clinton's & didn't raise an eyebrow with all the Pro-Clinton media types.In a way, I am not so sure that this type of comedy is the kind which dominated Vaudeville many years ago. The show always goes for the direct & quick laugh by being absurd, & more often than not, it is very successful.","9","15 April 2007"

"121","When I first watched this a decade ago, I wondered, ""Who created this?!"" and, ""What mental hospital did they escape from?"" Because ""Family Guy"" is not quite like any other show I've ever seen. A sense of humour like a fist in the face and a bunch of head cases for the roster of, ahem, ""people"", that make up these characters are taking animation to a new, hilarious depravity.Seth Macfarlane and Alex Borstein are at least half of the voices in a typical episode (or seem to be). How a blithering idiot of a Rhode Island dad and husband, an erudite pooch and an evil infant modelled on some cross between Rex Harrison and Satan all come from the same voice-over genius is one of television's great mysteries. Borstein is the ""sensible"" mom and wife, as well as so many other females who pop up for a couple seconds or the better part of half an hour. Her talents get a much broader and deeper workout here than on ""Mad TV"", where a lot of material wasn't fully suited to her incredible energy and intelligence.Some jokes make me wince (and still laugh) years after first hearing them (like anything involving ""Diff'rent Strokes"" or the late Bob Crane). I don't know if FOX has a censor at all or if they're just asleep when some really way out lines are written into any script. Things sure have changed since Jack Paar got into trouble for saying ""water closet"" back in the early 60s!It's mind boggling that this is in syndication and more popular now than ""The Flintstones"" were forty years ago. Wherever ""cartoons"" are headed in the 21st century, you can bet the power of disc sales will make execs pay much closer attention to whatever they're ready to cancel from now on. The voices of millions are being heard at cash registers!My favourite stories so far are really like an unofficial hour of two episodes. 1:""The Thin White Line"" and 2: ""Brian Does Hollywood"", where after developing a cocaine habit while working as a drug sniffing canine for the Quahog police department, he goes out to smoggy California to live with his cousin Jasper and break into the movies. Better than any others for summing up the ""everybody is fair game for a joke"" ethos we've come to know and love (or despise).","9","18 December 2009"

"123","Family guy is an animated comedy about a dysfunctional family living in Quahog, in Rhode Island. The family is headed by Peter griffin, the absolute definition of repulsive. He's grossly overweight, idiotic, unsanitary, and overall, incapable of being everything he is. His wife, Lois is everything a 42 year old mother of 3 kids wants to be - Hot, level headed, and smart. the 2 don't match, but that's one of the show's many jokes. Their children are Meg, an overweight unpopular girl who does everything that dramatic teens do, Chris, who takes after his father in almost every way, Stewie, the Baby who is always trying to kill his mother, and seems to have more brains than the whole family combined. finally rounding out the family is Brian, the family dog, however, unlike most dogs, Brian talks, dates human women, and has a sense of humor as dry as his martinis.The episodes usually involve 2 or 3 of the characters in a situation where they end up making crazy decisions. Peter goes abstinent, Lois learns karate, Chris gets the family in witness protection, meg becomes a lesbian, and the baby and the dog go on so many adventures together we've lost count.There are 2 main gags the show lives on - Musical numbers and cutaway gags. Surely you know what a musical number is. On the show, Brian and Stewie sing a song and dance around like it's the 1940's. The cutaway gags are a regular occurrence, where a character describes their problem as ""Worse"" or ""better than"" and then they usually say a celebrity's name, and what they did, which usually produces a funny clip.Overall, Family guy is a raunchy, politically incorrect half-hour of laughter and we wouldn't have it any other way.","9","15 August 2012"
"124","What a load of tripe this show is. And it's in syndication virtually 24/7. It's dreadful to look at because it's so poorly and lazily drawn. Its flashbacks are incredibly lame and unfunny. Story structures don't exist. If they do, they're unresolved. Certain scenes, as unfunny as they are, are inexplicably drawn out for minutes on end. Credit to Seth Macfarlane on his voice work (because every one else just plain sucks), but too bad he's got nothing interesting or funny to say. Watching this show is like watching any random commercial - you glance at it, and then it's erased from your memory forever. Nothing sticks. Pre-pubescent teens are in heaven because of it's potty humour, however, anybody with a braincell would dismiss this in a heartbeat. I can't believe the Fox network actually did something right (for once) for cancelling it. But it's Fox, and they resurrected it. What a shame that The Simpsons have to share the same network with these buffoons. South Park, the greatest animated show of all time, will steer clear.","1","11 September 2010"

Completely trashy, immature humour that is inappropriate for kids and unappealing to adults.The fact that this show is so popular really shows how our society is declining.This show seems to try being ""edgy"" to be funny, using primarily offensive jokes. The worst part is that some kids watch this show growing up. I shudder to think of how messed up those kids will be if they grow up finding THIS show funny!How can the garbage on this show actually be found funny by people?

"128","A cultural reference joke, a nasty repulsive joke, and a sex joke. Then the same all over again. Then more of the same. Then the episode's end. This is simply the forever format of Family Guy. And I hate it!We have nearly the same Simpsons family, yet with less interesting characters, a talking dog and sophisticated baby, and no ironic city. So it's a less comic copy of The Simpsons. And unlike The Simpsons warmth and meanings, Family Guy is made for kicks only. So it's clearly a heartless and mindless Simpsons too!There are not much of situations to make you laugh, only jokes; and they're divided into 2 kinds. The first is imaginative and snappy but mostly juvenile and mean. Speaking of mean; I think this is one of the meanest shows when it comes to mock at celebrities. The second is flatly unfunny and horrendously boring. Hence, it's rare when one joke works! The cultural references are too many to stand. It takes a very dedicated ""American"" TV viewer, or historian, to get. And dirty humor and sex are used in sick ways. OK. I won't wonder. What do I expect from a show that draws its lead character's chin as testicles!Although the always petulant, British talking, sophisticated baby is a different character that could make a comic show of its own, but it's used in such an annoying way. Everything he says or does is unfunny, rather disturbing, which turns him into a real creep!In terms of the drawings, the level of creativeness is low. The side characters seem the same. And as for the backgrounds, there is no creativeness or caring in the first place.This is The Simpsons poor imitator who doesn't think in anything but making laughs, doesn't make laughs outside cultural references, repulsiveness, sex, and doesn't make these very laughs decent along the way. In brief, the difference between The Simpsons and Family Guy is like the one between The Defiant Ones (1958) and Black Mama, White Mama (1972)!My Verdict: Small part of its comedy works, the rest is a mix of cheapness and ugliness. Take it from me; watch The Simpsons, it is way better, unless you love odious exploitation, and trash TV.P.S: This shoddy clone has a shoddier clone for itself; and I mean none other than The Cleveland Show. It's like coping badly from an already bad copy. Nevertheless, it has one advantage; it makes Family Guy look good!","1","4 September 2013"

I would recommend anyone who likes to get to know American culture and to get a few laughs during the process.","4","24 February 2019"
"130","I've heard that ""Family Guy"" has been pulled from television? Don't know if it's true or not, but ""Family Guy"" has/had so much potential, the difference between ""Family Guy"" and ""The Simpsons"" is that ""Family Guy"" isn't really based for all ages, it's far more crude and less subtle. I really like ""Family Guy"" it is original in places, and in a world where cartoons have to compete with ""The Simpsons"" that's saying something.",NA,"20 December 2002"
"131","When Family Guy first debuted back in 1999, it was absolutely brilliant, and for three seasons was consistently excellent, with some of my personal favourite episodes being ""Chitty Chitty Death Bang"", ""Da Boom"", ""Holy Crap"", ""Road To Rhode Island"", ""There's Something About Paulie"", ""Road To Europe"" and ""Ready Willing And Disabled"".While the characters were pretty much all good in their own way (except Meg, who, let's face it, was an annoying brat), my favourite character was easily Stewie, who , despite being a baby, was also a homicidal evil genius obsessed with killing his own mother. BRILLIANT! Most of the side characters were hilarious as well, particularly Quagmire.After 3 excellent seasons, however, it was cancelled. This isn't exactly a bad thing, however, as many other sitcoms have lasted a short while and have been remembered as some of the greatest sitcoms of all time, the biggest example of that being Fawlty Towers. If FG had stayed cancelled it would be remembered as one of the greatest shows of all time.Unfortunately, it came back. BIG MISTAKE! Don't get me wrong. Season 4 was very good, with excellent episodes such as ""The Cleveland-Loretta-Quagmire"", ""Petarded"", ""Peter's Got Woods"", ""PTV"", ""The Fat Guy Strangler"", ""The Father, The Son And The Holy Fonz"" and the fantastic ""Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story"" trilogy. However, S4 wasn't exactly as consistent as the first 3 seasons.It was Season 5 were it really began to run out of steam, being merely an ""alright"" season with a very mixed quality of episodes. By this point, Seth Macfarlane had also started to change many of the good things about the show, transforming Stewie's character from an evil genius to a repressed homosexual, and making Peter more and more stupid. Despite this, there were still some good episodes such as ""Peter's Two Dads"" and ""Meet The Quagmires"". Season 6 was more or less the same. Despite containing the absolute masterpiece that was ""Stewie Kills Lois/Lois Kills Stewie"" (My two favourite Family Guy episodes by the way) the rest of the season was kind of meh. Season 7 was yet again underwhelming, with the only standout episodes being ""I Dream Of Jesus"" and ""We Love You, Conrad"".Then we got to Season 8, and this is when the show started to become a giant load of horses**t. Not one SINGLE episode in Season 8 was even funny in the slightest and the show became way too vulgar and offensive, with the biggest examples being ""Dial Meg For Murder"", ""Quagmire's Dad"", the RUBBISH Star Wars parodies and ""Peter-assment"". Season 9 was again terrible, despite containing two very good episodes (""And Then There Were Fewer"" and ""Road To The North Pole"". Season 10 was again the same. Despite some really good episodes like the fantastic ""Back To The Pilot"" and ""Mr. And Mrs. Stewie"", they couldn't make up for the rest of the season, which contained such travesties as ""Seahorse Seashell Party"" and ""Screams Of Silence: The Story Of Brenda Q"". And Seasons 11 and 12 were both completely terrible all the way through, with ZERO redeeming qualities. So I have made the decision to stop watching.In conclusion, Family Guy was a once great show that, just like The Simpsons, has become a giant load of crap. But for once being a fantastic show, I'm going to give it an 8/10.","8","5 September 2014"
"132","Here's Quagmire's take on a vaudeville musical number :Make em laugh, make em laugh; Don't you know all the world loves to laugh; I always try to find the hottest chick in the place; I crack her on the noggin with a lamp or a vase; And then when she's unconscious I do stuff to her face; Make em laugh, make em laugh, make em laugh.Not really the Simpsons is it?The writing is top notch, but the plot often meanders to wherever the best gags are - pretty much stream of consciousness stuff. They cram an enormous amount of risqué humour, obscure pop culture references, and plot twists into twenty minutes, but some people might find it a bit much. Personally I think it will go down as a cult classic.","10","20 June 2008"
"133","Family Guy used to be a great show, but unfortunately, the writers started to lose their ideas about the show. The show started out amazingly, but somewhere around Season 12, the show started to go downhill. Some episodes of the show today shouldn't even be a full episode, rather just one scene. Plus, Seth MacFarlane always shoves his beliefs down our throats. The show completely fell from grace a long time ago, I don't even understand why FOX has the need to keep airing this show anymore.","4","12 October 2020"
"134","Honestly, up until its 2002 cancellation I would have deemed this as a decent show that definitely had a good run, albeit a short one... Yet, whenever I may happen upon an airing of this show after its return, I can't help but feel disgusted at the pathetically large effort MacFarlane's show puts in to get laughs out this mind-numbing dreck.It is in no way as clever as it used to be, and no longer retains any of the originality it used to have, and to be honest, every time I see it now it reminds me of the classic ""SIMPSON'S DID IT"" episode of South Park (which is an actually decent show that is both intellectually stimulating and controversial - a good combination).Anyways, I'd rather not list off the many flaws within the characters and the writing in general, since that would take all night... but I will say that Seth MacFarlane needs to quit before he ruins the minds of society altogether","1","29 June 2011"
"135","If there was no Simpsons or South Park, this could probably be the best cartoon series ever created. Creator Seth MacFarlane, who also voices Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, Glen Quagmire and Tom Tucker and many others has created a great adult comedy cartoon. Also starring Alex Borstein as Lois Griffin and Loretta Brown, Mila Kunis as Meg Griffin, Seth Green as Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman and regular guest Jennifer Tilly as Bonnie Swanson. Basically its the same format as Simpsons, a family that have misadventures, a fat dad and each member having their own individual happenings. The only difference is that it has a baby and a dog, that can actually talk. And its like South Park because of some bad language and violence included. Guests have included Drew Barrymore, Haley Joel Osment, Jay Mohr, Gene Simmons, Carrie Fisher, Patrick Duffy, Mary Kay Bergman and Will Ferrel. It has won 2 Emmys for Outstanding Music and Lyrics and Outstanding Voice-Over Performance, and it has been nominated for 3 Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour) awards and Outstanding Music and Lyrics. It was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Outstanding!","10","8 December 2005"

"137","When I first saw the show Family Guy me and my family were really into it and entertained and said the show was hilarious. We enjoyed the crazy episodes and I really loved some of the jokes they had, but as the show progressed it got sour, the show started getting predictable, but then it started bashing God and Jesus and my family and I are a family of faith. We couldn't watch the show anymore because of the things, Seth Macfarlane said was very offensive. At first we gave it a chance and stayed open minded and tried not to judge it just by that, but the things the show kept on saying made me and my family uncomfortable. So I am writing this review to say that I would've enjoyed it, if only the bashing of not only my families beliefs, but also, other people's beliefs in a higher power wasn't thrown as jokes like that. All in all, I recently watched the show and an episode said God was autistic and that deeply offended me. So I would rather not watch the show or see it on TV.","1","25 June 2014"
"138","Family Guy is amazing show. The storylines are hilarious and cynical as always. The characters are great, but need more character development to win back their fans.

"139","Family Guy started out on TV in 1999. But you know, I didn't really start watching it until, like, what, 2005? Well, I was 6 when I got to Edmonton in 1999, so don't be hating. Still, I wish I knew about it earlier. Seth MacFarlane is a really funny guy. He knows the events going on, and also, he has the guts to take a stab at ANYONE. No one is safe from him.Family Guy centers around the Griffin family: Peter, the father and mentally retarded man who works at the brewery (well, I think that's in later seasons); Lois, the mother (I don't know how to describe her); Meg, the eldest child and the one that everyone in the show hates; Chris, the eldest son who takes after his father--brains and physique, neither are good; Stewie, the baby genius who is trying to kill Lois in any way possible, and Brian, the family's martini-drinking dog who really fancies Lois (oh, he talks, too).Seth MacFarlane provides many voices in the show: Peter, Stewie, Brian (whose voice is the closest to MacFarlane's), Glen Quagmire (the sexually charged neighbour of the Griffins's), and others.Please be warned that this show is pretty offensive, and the characters really vary in a wide range (elderly pedophile, cop in a wheelchair {Joe}, Cleveland Brown {black friend of Peter}, etc.) If you give a s**t about anything that I'm writing here then try and watch this show. It's funny. Then say if this comment was helpful or not.","10","27 September 2007"
"140","OK, what can be said about family guy? well first off, in first appearance the family may seem closely similar to the simpsons, but when you see peter, Louis,Chris,meg,Brian and Stewie in action you won't help but laugh. Now as a fan of both the simpsons and family guy I have to say that their similarities are mostly based on the characters traits: Peter Griffin a fat idiot who always get into trouble by doing something really retarded, similar to homer Simpson. Louis a housewife who is married to a total idiot but still stays with him for some reason, similar to Marge. Those similarities may have lead to people believing that the show is not original, but wasn't halloween(1978) similar to black Christmas (1974), besides the simpsons have been on the air for so long it's almost impossible to create a family such as this and not do anything the simpsons haven't already done, and though some jokes may appear similar to the simpsons' they will still have you laughing hard with them. Originality of films and TV shows are not based on the characters it's the storyline and what they have to offer that separates them from others that are similar to them, and I have to say with Peter's adventures you will easily see how original can Family Guy really be.","9","5 January 2009"

This will cause a lot of attention for them. And a lot for the wrong reasons. It is like The Simpsons and the controversy it had when it first premiered.The baby, Stewie, is a character that will be a hit.The writing is original, controversial, but original.So please, just give this show a chance.

But also what I like about it is when for example when Peter makes a mistake or something he goes into this professionally rehearsed (seemingly) speech and it really makes the show a lot better because the character learns from his mistake.Seth Macfarlane, I would like to thank you for all your hard work and dedication to make this show my favorite show on television. Cheers to you!!!!!!And to all you Family guy watchers out there, I thank you too for not letting this show to be canceled.And that is all I have to write about the best show on television, Family guy.","10","3 August 2005"
"143","Brilliant, edgy comedy.Created by Seth MacFarlane (who also does some of the voices), a story revolving around Peter Griffin and his family - Lois, Chris, Meg and Brian, the dog - plus some friends and neighbours. Sort of The Simpsons but with more adult-orientated humour, more in- jokes and more pokes at modern life.Very funny and clever. Many of the jokes require you to know about history and other topics.Quite irreverent and edgy too - don't watch this if you're easily offended.Only negative is that Seth MacFarlane doesn't seem to know when to stop it. It is now into its 14th season and is feeling a bit jaded. Surprised that MacFarlane is continuing it, especially as he has already launched a few spin-offs (The Cleveland Show, American Dad).","10","19 December 2015"
"144","Family Guy was Seth MacFarlane's foray into television almost 20 years ago. It's hard to believe that Family Guy is nearly that old already, even counting the years it was cancelled. It is amazing the show is still on tv, having been cancelled not once, but twice already. The audience loves the show, even though critics always compare the show to the success of The Simpsons.Peter Griffin, the patriarch of the show has done some crazy, miraculous stunts and it's surprising he's still alive. Stewie, the baby steals the show every chance he can. He and Brian, the family dog, have the best episodes and stories, especially the Road episodes, which center around parodying the Road to films of Bob Hope.The show is also full of songs and music, mostly originally written by MacFarlane and Walter Murphy. It's like having R rated versions of Randy Newman songs (which Newman has ironically been portrayed on the show as being mentally disabled). However, the songs are pretty funny and usually relevant.","9","11 October 2018"
"145","""Family Guy"" is probably the most ballsy sitcom ever produced. It relentlessly skewers everything it can think of, from TV shows to family drama. Best of all, it's one of the few TV shows on today that's actually funny.The show revolves around the Griffins: Peter, the obese father whose schemes are limited by his lack of intelligence. Lois, the mother who is more or less the head of the family, even though Peter considers himself to be that. Chris, the fat teenage son who has just as few brains as his dad. Meg, the black sheep of the family that is the but of everyone's jokes. Stewie, the baby who has plans for killing his mother and taking over the world. And Brian, the family dog, who is frequently the voice of reason, but is frequently corrupted.""Family Guy"" employs many tactics to get laughs from the audience. Most notable are the frequent cutaways that spoof what has just been said. They are effective because of the impeccable timing, and in how they play out. ""Family Guy"" uses spoofs to get humor as well, most commonly from 80's TV shows. What really makes the show so great is that a person doesn't have to be familiar with what it's spoofing. I'm sure it would help, but the material is funny enough in its own right. But the show doesn't stop there. Not only does it spoof just about everything, it skewers its own spoofs! The show is filled with off-color humor. The only reason why people aren't up in arms about the show is probably because it makes fun of every race, sex and other generality equally. There is nothing sacred here, and no one and nothing is immune from ""Family Guy's"" satirical jabs.Putting on musical numbers in a film takes a lot of time and effort, and it's a very big risk. But ""Family Guy"" contains some great songs. All well-written and performed, and of course they are hilarious (perhaps the most famous one, ""The Freakin' FCC"" is both catchy, and hysterical because it hits the ratings board where it hurts).The voice characterizations are right on the money. Seth McFarlane is tremendously talented. He provides the voices for Peter, Brian (which is his own natural voice), and Stewie. Not only are the voices consistent and creative, he can alter their pitch at will, so it really seems as if they are spoken by three different actors. Alex Borstein brings a nasally drawl to Lois that is perfect for the character. Seth Green is unrecognizable as Chris (had I not looked on IMDb, I would have never known that it was him). Lacey Chabert originated the character of Meg, and while she was good, Mila Kunis really elevated the character with her sharp voice. Kunis gives Meg a new, sharper edge that she didn't have with Chabert.""Family Guy"" has been compared to ""The Simpsons,"" and that's entirely understandable (and not just because they are produced by FOX). Both are satires of blue-collar life, and while ""The Simpsons"" is good, ""Family Guy"" contains are sharper edge. The show is utterly fearless. There is no real sacred cow. The show lampoons handicaps (physical and mental), ethnicities, TV shows and movies, celebrities, politicians, religion (especially catholicism), drug use and addiction, sexual humor of all kinds (including S&M), and some that's just beyond description. Not everything ""Family Guy"" throws at the audience works, but as a whole, the show is consistently amusing and frequently hilarious.If there's any flaw with ""Family Guy,"" it's that the jokes run on far too long sometimes. Particularly with the ""awkward moment"" jokes, the sequences are stretched for so long that not only does it cease to become funny, it becomes so irritating (and long) that a fast-forward button is warranted. These can be effective at about 10 to 15 seconds, but the show sometimes stretches these to beyond two minutes. One could argue that the show rewrites its rules to suit the plot, and it often does (for example, Brian frequently acts like a person, but he still acts like a dog when the story requires it). But that's not a problem because the show still works.Some people have argued that the show has stopped being funny. While I agree that it's not as edgy as it used to be, I think the blame lies with FOX, not McFarlane and his crew. The show originated with FOX, but after some lackluster ratings and viewer turnout, it was canceled. However, DVD sales were large enough for it to be picked up by Adult Swim. The show became an instant success, and it was once again bought by FOX. However, because the show is so big now, FOX is afraid to let the writers experiment and try new things. While it's still funny, the humor is not as fresh and edgy.Definitely check this show out. It's awesome.","9","22 July 2009"
"146","This is the most insulting thing I've ever seen... AND I LOVE IT!!! There are those who say this is a rip off of the simpsons... well, granted there are similarities BUT(!) I would say that Family Guy takes what the simpsons do and MAKE IT BETTER!!! I just about wet myself with laughter when Quagmire shoots the simpsons!!! XD I agree with animalfanatic that Brian and Stewie are an excellent pair! The ""Road To"" episodes are the ones I enjoy most. The most recent one to cross my path was Road to Berlin and I have to say - I laughed my arse off!!! The best line was from the scene in the German U-Boat When Stewie says to Mort Goldman ""I swear to God I'll stuff you in a torpedo tube and crush you against the sea!"". Some of the lines in this series are amongst the funniest and most ingenious ever written!!! Seth McFarlane has my eternal thanks for this wonderful series!! 10 OUT OF 10","10","28 April 2010"
"147","Usually I post reviews for MST3K movies, but this time I've decided to write about the animated television series Family Guy. To put it bluntly, this is one freakishly bizarre and hilarious show. Some of the jokes just have me rolling every time, like the Scooby Doo Mystery Files or the dialogue between the two news anchors that Peter watches. I would rather watch this than The Simpsons lately, just because I think that show has run its course and needs to be put to bed. Other Fox 'toons like King of the Hill and Futurama are pretty creative and funny in their own right, with King having a drier sense of humor then the wacked-out Futurama, but FG has characters that I just want to hug because they're so wonderful. Stewie is probably the best of the bunch, with Brian the dog coming in a close second. Peter and Louis are okay, although the show doesn't give them much to do besides yell at the other. Meg and her brother (can't think of his name at the moment) are usually left in the background, but having to pick I would say Meg is more interesting then her horny relation because she's just so boring and pathetic. In short, she's like every whiny teenager on this little marble of a planet. Family Guy should not be cancelled just because it cannot stand up against Friends or Survivor. Fox is being ridiculous if they think the little show can get good ratings when it goes up against the two biggest franchises in television at the moment and doesn't have any marketing on its home channel. They should move it to another night like Tuesday or Wednesday, because in my opinion there is nothing really good on Fox during those nights besides That 70's Show. In fact, cancel That 80's Show and give its time slot to FG, because 80's Show is just horrible. To end my review, here's my fave FG joke:News Anchor: Boy scouts selling cookies to little old ladies. Is there anything more arousing?News Anchor 2: I don't think so Bob.",NA,"11 May 2002"

"150","I really enjoy watching family guy. Its very original and very entertaining. Is definitely one of funniest animated shows of all time. Family guy is so much better than Simpson's. Simpson's is well passed its prime and family guy is still rolling. The newest seasons are very funny and great to watch. The first couple of season's was good but not that great. The animation was weak and is much worse than the newest season. I love all the jokes in this show, so many of them are funny and hilarious.There are always laughs when i watch this show (unless I've seen the same episode many times). All the characters are very unique and original. Stewie is my favorite character, he's hella funny. There nothing like the Simpson's...Family guy is better than the Simpson's because its more fun, funny and realistic. Simpson's is so fake, i mean c'mon..their skin is yellow, their head shapes and hair are weird and many characters have colored hair like blue, green, red..Family guy is so fun, i give this a 10/10 for nonstop entertainment and jokes","10","15 November 2008"
"151","Jackie Gleason canceled the ""Honeymooners"" after one season because the ""Classic 39"" episodes would be difficult to top. And he was right. It's better to finish on a high rather than fade into mediocrity. The first 3 seasons of ""Family Guy"" were mostly brilliant. The next few seasons were more hit than miss. This most recent was awful: in one episode Peter became a pirate, which was absurd. Yes I know it's a cartoon, but at least have a reasonable plot. Even the Star Wars parody was more interesting than funny (I did like the fact that Rush Limbaugh was in it).This show is headed down the same path as The Simpsons, which hasn't been funny since the mid-90's. As a recent astute poster articulated, the older FG episodes were much funnier and at least had plots to them. It's the same with the Simpsons: it's no coincidence that the actors' favorite episodes occurred in the first 5 seasons. I bought the first 2 seasons on DVD and was listening to the commentary and Seth MacFarlane was mentioning Stewie's character evolvement. In the first few years, Stewie was the ego-maniacal but lovably erudite toddler bent on world domination. MacFarlane seemed to pooh-pooh that characterization, and now the writers are playing up Stewie's latent homosexuality. The homosexual thing has run its course. Was there anything funnier than when Stewie tried to control Chris to carry out Stewie's nefarious deeds--like when Chris went to the hardware store and Stewie was controlling Chris? Was there anything funnier than when Stewie was on Bill Cosby's show? Or when Peter was changing Stewie and sprinkled paprika on Stewie instead of powder? Or the Christmas episode?Speaking of ego-maniacal, Seth MacFarlane has certainly sold his soul to the devil. He got a boatload of money from Fox to produce absolute rubbish. The recent episodes do not come close to approaching the first 2 seasons, and yet people somehow find the more recent ones funny, and so MacFarlane just keeps lazily cranking out this tripe. Another thing I have noticed: in the first few seasons, the religious depictions were mildly irreverent and funny without being insulting (i.e the Pope in ""Holy Crap"" and the depiction of God and Jesus). Now in the last few years, McFarland's enmity towards the deity and Christianity has gone from cute and irreverent to outright blasphemous. And oh yeah, let's see if Obama is as lampooned as much as George Bush. Essentially, when the scripts suck, then go to plan B: insult Christians and embrace leftist politics. I read that many writers left after the 1st 2 seasons because the show was canceled. If they haven't gotten them back---then they really should because the show is more miss than hit these days. In fact, I don't even watch the first-run episodes anymore.The rating of 6 would have been higher if not for the last few seasons.","6","29 July 2008"
"152","I'm a big fan of family guy, but in the recent years, South Park is much better, mainly because they are not afraid of offending anyone, they make fun of both sides. Family guy, recently, sided with the left and basically all episodes are becoming lame, boring and without hardcore stuff that we loved before. And even when they make a more hardcore joke, they immediately justify it and say sorry, showing they are afraid. Meh, I miss the old family guy. Seth is soft now, maybe he wants more Hollywood friends. I will keep watching, I still have hope. I keep the 7 stars for now lol.","7","11 May 2020"
"153","Family Guy has to be my all time favorite cartoon.It is definitely the funniest TV show ever made and is better than The Simpsons.I have never laughed so hard at a TV show in my life The things that make the show so funny is the plot,characters and themes that are dealt with in the show.There are very few themes that have not been dealt with on Family Guy.I have seen just about every episode of Family Guy ever made and would have to say that the show was better in the first two seasons.My favorite characters are Peter because he is very funny and is the best character of the show.My second favorite character is Stewie because he is the funniest villain to be on a TV show.If you love Family Guiy you should check out American Dad because it is just so similar and is created by Seth McFarlane.I hope this show never ends because it is a comic genius! 10/10","10","11 March 2009"

"156","I've watched numerous episodes of this series in the vain hope of figuring out what the hell it is that so many people love so much about it. No such luck. It just strikes me as 'The Simpsons' crossed with 'South Park' minus all traces of wit, irony, satire, and any other redeeming features of the aforementioned animated shows. The number of times I have laughed at this program I could count on one hand, and it's never been more than a mild chuckle.Look, I'm fine with repulsive characters, tasteless jokes, un-PC behaviour and gross-out humour - as long as there's actually some kind of point to it. But in 'The Family Guy' I have found none.And what is with all those pop-culture references, which are, again, used for zero effect? Oh, look, that bit they just did is like what happened in, umm, that movie. Err, hehe ... h ... hmm.I don't think I've given another movie or TV program a single solitary star here at IMDb, but I'm going to do so here - I just can't think of any other screen offering with so little to recommend it.","1","22 May 2006"

"158","I saw ""Family Guy"" when it first aired on FOX in January 1999, and I couldn't stop laughing. The show was a riot. I loved it better than ""The Simpsons"".When it was cancelled a few years later, I went into depression's big time. I thought the world had ended for me. I wanted to see my buddy Peter Griffin to return for more ""Family Guy"". And sure enough, I later discovered on the Internet news it was gonna come back. The question that remained was: When was ""Family Guy"" returning to TV?I didn't have to wait long. Upon its return, I found it funnier than it was years before. The show had greatly improved all the way! The characters had developed to a better style. And the supporting cast had developed even better, too. The one who stood out was Quagmire. I just find him the raunchiest, but craziest fella in the history of cartoons. He makes Daffy Duck look like a loser.I've taped every show and remain a loyal fan to this day. I even work with some guys at my workplace who are fans of ""Family Guy"". What can I say, except this show is a downright, hair-raising heck of a series. I want it to stay on FOX until the day I die, then they can cancel ""Family Guy""!","10","29 July 2007"

"160","""Family Guy"" spotlights the life of a Rhode Island family, the Griffins. Peter is a fat, stupid husband to Lois, who is smart and surprisingly tolerates Peter despite the various antics he does. They have three kids, angst-ridden Meg, dim-witted Chris, and Stewie, an intelligent baby with a demented plan of dominating the world (and killing Lois). Topping off the family is Brian, a talking dog who is somewhat the most normal one in the family.The early seasons of ""Family Guy"" were very funny, with random gags and some envelope-pushing humor along a good storyline. Now, the reason why I say the show is the most uneven comedy on TV because after it has returned to TV, it's very hit-or-miss. Story lines were kicked to the curb in place of pop-culture references and long jokes. There's nothing wrong with a comedy that's completely random, but it has to be funny all the way, or at least most of the time.The long jokes are mostly annoying, ruining the punchline by making it go on and on. If I was running the show, I'd fire the editor.The pop-culture references swing wildly between a funny joke or just a reference, which is unnecessary. Also, at times the show tries too hard to be offensive.The recent season so far is mostly funny, so I'm not complaining. However, Seth MacFarlane and his crew needs to let the funny outweigh the unfunny.","6","5 January 2008"

It is so random and that is was sometimes makes it unique and fun to watch but i do think sometimes it is TOO random, i mean there is random and then there is going completely off the point.I think Family guy could be improved, maybe without having the random (real life) singers randomly appearing, i mean it is random enough without them scenes, they just make it stupid. I know a lot of people don't like this because of the randomness and swearing etc but that's how it is, it is always on late at night for a reason, it wouldn't be family guy without the swearing and random scenes etc.I think it deserves a 7 or 8 out of 10.","8","5 March 2014"

"164","For my 1000th review (on this account) I wanted to do something special, so I am finally reviewing that show of shows: Family Guy.You know, I used to be really into the Simpsons. Like, really into them. But everything I liked in them I got in greater quantities from FG. It wasn't a rip-off on the macro-level. They're both animated sitcom families but that's cosmetic at best. A lot of people insist that this show began well and then went to sea. The exact opposite is the truth. I think such people preferred the safe, ostensible rip-off because it was a more transgressive variation of that yellow family.It was after the show came back from the dead (twice) that the show realised it did not have to play it as safe and began to discover itself. Still transgressive and juvenile, but in a totally new way that no other show had dared to be.It's hard to put in words what this new generation of the Griffins was to me. So, I will use that catch-all word ""postmodern"". I mean it though; a show that rejects boundaries, a show that tips over sacred cows, a show that delighted in its own artificiality. FG tries to be a funhouse mirror image of society; it takes some of the most horrific and bizarre things that we have all gotten used to and tries to find humor in the darkest depths of the human soul.At one point the thing people hated was the interchangeable jokes. This is a very blinkered understanding of comedy. Family Guy cannot be evaluated under the lens of a conventional sitcom because it is not a conventional sitcom but rather a trailblazing hybrid of the sitcom and the sketch-show. They do whatever is funny no matter what. In addition to the intertextuality, the use of irony and self-reference, we have an unusual narrative structure that happily uses fragmentation and never mutilates its jokes by forcing them into a normal story-mode with a nauseating moral. On that note, I like to think of FG as a pastiche of that kind of sitcom where the ""wholesomeness"" is subverted into something, perhaps often quite vicious, but at the same time a lot more honest. They say the things that we are too scared to say.The cut-away gags are mostly pretty cool but the show also manages to maintain this efficient sketch-show approach to humor by showing scene after scene which are themselves just sketches with the main cast trying to do a particular thing, like Peter enjoying his obsession of the week or him helping his son to study better. In recent years they have been less cut-away dependent and actually have some really fun stories.You just get the feeling that anything can happen in FG. Including a lot of moments where the bizarre is juxtaposed to the mundane and people react (almost) you would expect them to, so the show really keeps you on your toes not only with surreal humor but also anti-humor and what I like to call anti-anti-humor (in which the humor is on how the bad the humor is...words don't really do it justice).A lot of people cannot take the heat with this show and condemn the main cast as monsters but that is the point. Yes, they embody the terribleness we see in ourselves and that is the point. I am the worst when it comes to condemning a show for punishing its characters but with FG, there is no pretence to the contrary. The show knows exactly what it is doing, it knows exactly what it looks like to you and you know they know that they are being brutal. There is a lot of authorial sadism in a lot of shows and I like to think that FG is just giving the audience a purer taste of the kind of thing they have grown addicted to. Yes, they treat Meg horribly. But Two and a Half Men treat Alan abominably too. With FG it is palatable because 1) like I said, you really feel that the writers are aware of what they are doing and 2) nothing is permanent in this show: the worst things can happen but by the next scene, it's fine.People object to the dark humor because people always will. It annoys me how FG gets singled out among all the other animated shows when it's no less clever. It's low brow but low brow does not mean easy to write. I like that they have no shame in jokes about rape, suicide, child-abuse etc. A joke on a thing is not that thing, ceci n'est pas une pipe. The show has always been written with a liberal bias. I'm not going to make excuses for this show when they have been blatantly racist or misogynistic or both but they have recognized this and are moving beyond that and not in the sanctimonious ""we've had a lot of fun tonight BUT"" way but simply in making great jokes on the right side of history. Once in while they have political episode and they do say a few things that need to be said but mostly it's just comedy rather than burdened with a heavy-handed point like South Park.No disrespect to South Park, but one observation: an idea that would fuel an entire episode of South Part is about a minute in FG.I think a lot of the louder hate for this show is just that too many people saw their worst self in it and couldn't quite handle it. Not that I don't respect why this show is not for everyone.Peter Griffin may indeed be Homer Simpson but more so. But the Homer is taken from Fred Flintstone who in turn is that Honeymooner's guy. He seems to have no standard upon himself and embodies toxic masculinity but, delightfully, he often shows he is in touch with his feminine side and loves discovering new hobbies. Lois used to annoy me as the most obnoxious high-horse character but she has since developed into a deeply troubled vision of the suburban ""Mom""; a chemically dependent, well-meaning individual who really just taking what she can get from a wasted life, occasionally going the extra mile for her kids. I love how her marriage is not the classic sitcom idealism of Homer and Marge but something a lot more honest: a quiet desperation that she keeps doing just because it sort of works. I love how when Peter is shown a future where they have split up his response is ""so I finally had the guts to leave her; good for you, Peter"". This kind of subversion is part of why I adore this show.I am going to take this opportunity to list some things I don't like though.-Often too gross. Just because I like jokes about rape and suicide does not mean I enjoy anal flatulence.-Too often the joke is just an imitation of something from popular culture, not actually making fun of if including a long clip once.-Stretching things out so long it's funny is just not a good idea.-One time they drop a bunch of Game of Thrones spoilers. That's not OK.Moving on: I like Meg. I like how in recent years they have let her have her moments and in time she has gone from a victim to a really dark side. Sweet piece of ass too...I love Brian. He began as a straight man but they developed him into something amazing. He's a dog living in a human's world. He might be able to talk but that doesn't mean he is smart. He is a conscientious and literate person but he often thinks he is way smarter than what he really is: a wannabe intellectual trying to forge an identity. The double act with Stewie is so charming and poignant as they each try to take the other down a peg but are always there for each other. It hurts me when the writers seem committed to making Brian into a genuine villain but I like to think that villainy is contained to the episodes in question.I want to talk briefly about Quagmire: I think he is an homage to the classic '50s man. Considering he is based physically on Bob Hope and takes his voice from vintage ads and on top of this is a pilot (jet age), it's not too hard to see him as a way of making fun of a previous time in which people were less sex-positive but a lot more willing to look the other way on rape. This is perhaps why he is a shameless sex-hound. In later seasons it is fun to see his other side; someone snooty, hypocritical and with a lot of old-fashioned habits.I cannot not mention Herbert. Even having him for a character was audacious. Love him. There's no way British TV would make jokes like that. Peter is probably more like him than a lot of people realise.The design of the show is something admirable. A lot of sordid animated shows look filthy and use of country or hip-hop in the soundtrack. No disrespect to that aesthetic or musical genres but I love that FG embraced a more vibrant style reminiscent of retro musicals. It allows the dark/blue humor to juxtapose and not overwhelm. The musical numbers are almost always a treat that are sung well and superbly visualized. Tons of people have discovered new music from this show, I know at least someone became a big fan of Conway Twitty because of this show.This is hard to put into words but the writers really know their way around a joke even if you don't like the kind of joke. The timing is impeccable and the minute word choices (like especial instead of special) make a difference. In one episode Chris has a black lover and Lois, trying to break an awkward silence, says, ""I voted for Obama once"". First of all, it's racist to think that this would score points with every black person. But also, she says ""once"" so even if her voting history mattered here, it really counts for little. It is a self-defeating statement from every angle. Again, I'm not saying it's highbrow but it gives us so much to process and unpack in just five simple words.I can watch this again and again and it's one of the few shows that gets me laughing. For a while I dare say it got better ever season before just plateauing. In a world with so much nonsense and frustration, this show just lets loose and doesn't care about hurting feelings while still having the courtesy to not be a Nazi about anything. Maybe I'm being hypocritical but this is one of the most audacious works of art that humanity has yet come up with.","8","19 February 2022"

"166","Family Guy is a long running animated program that has had an huge impact on pop culture. The show brought a nice mix of sitcom tropes, black comedy, ""low-brow"" humor, intelligent jokes, and gags. I've been watching since 2007, ""Stewie Kills Lois"" was my first episode, and I've been hooked ever since. However, the show has been running out of steam.I wasn't even around for the original run, but I think pre-cancellation episodes are superior to what we have now. They milked every opportunity for a joke they could. Nowadays, they just make lame observations or overdone celebrity comparisons, even when the plot screams absurdity. ""Saturated Fat Guy"" for example, had so many chances to play off of Peter's unhealthy habits, but it just fell flat. The scene where Peter thought about how successful his junk food business could be could've been home to some funny visuals, like him living in a mansion made of junk food, and diving in a pool of soda or beer. Instead, we got some line about a celebrity being sad on a ride. The jokes used to be clever, but recently, they over-explain them or give away the punchline in the delivery, which kills the momentum.Also, since Season 4, they've had scenes where the characters just stand around and talk about nothing for minutes on end. I think they're going for a ""Seinfeld Conversation"" kind of thing but it doesn't mesh well with the show's fast paced style. The show's use of black comedy has also downgraded. They're no punchline or point to the dark events on the show, they just happen and we're supposed to laugh. Just like a joke about a lamp can be lame, a joke about a dead baby can too. The pilot episode, for example, had a great joke about Hitler being jealous of a Jew at the gym. And for 1/3 of the show's run, Stewie would stop at nothing to kill his mother Lois, which was a goldmine of dark comedy. Nowadays, they do things like having Peter brutally slaying a whale for no good reason and blowing up children's hospitals just because. I will say the violence in the recent Quentin Tatrintino episode was great because it was a nice parody of his style. Also, they just list racial stereotypes now instead of playing with them like they use to.The show is still pretty good, but ironically, they lost their edge while trying to be edgier. The recent season seems to be getting back on the right track, especially with the story arcs and ""experiment"" episodes. Here's to many great FG episodes to come.",NA,"7 February 2018"

It was a complete waste of time, from beginning to end.The cultural references were lame, most of the jokes were unfunny and offensive, and all about this show sucked.This show is worthless.

"169","Well the latest TV fad is finally starting to slow down, but not fast enough. And it just keeps getting worse and worse.Do the writers have ADD or something?

""I haven't felt like this since...""Jeez! Give it a rest already! Why do they even bother trying to pretend that there's a plot? Why not just turn the whole thing into a sketch show?So is there anything original or innovative about Family Guy? No. It's trying to do what The Simpsons and South Park have already done, and it doesn't do it nearly as well. It's utterly forgettable. Years later when Matt Groening has become the modern day Hanna & Barbara, people will say ""Seth MacFarlene who?""Another thing I don't get about Family Guy fans, other than their ability to withstand day after day of reruns of the same crap, is how they always use the argument when defending Family Guy ""It was brought back from cancellation twice, so it must be good"". There are things better than being brought back from cancellation twice, such as being brought back from cancellation once, or better yet, never being canceled at all.But whatever.

"170","Family Guy has become an institution of pop culture and American life in many ways, in the same way that it uses pop culture to make people laugh at old and silly nostalgic shows/references.I am glad they kept making it for a long time, though now I feel it has certainly seen its better years. Most seasons were a 8 or 9; the most recent season feels more like a 4 or 5. Like all great shows, this one is running out of gas, and feels like an amalgamation of disjointed writing on autopilot, with random scenes and jokes patched together to the point of absurdity. The other annoying part is the atheistic and political preaching that has become more apparent over the years. Usually, FG would do a good job of bashing all sides, but it has become a bit more aggressive and preachy on certain topics. MacFarlane is very talented, but it feels like they are running out of material, or let someone's nieces and nephews write the show now while the big wigs are out partying and doing other stuff. I still watch the show, and it has provided years of outrageous, non-PC entertainment, that so many of us still enjoy in America, amidst the suffocating tirade of socially-conscious, social justice, safe space crap from mainstream media, academia, and Hollywood of late.I can't believe people inflate the Simpsons as being better than this show, and accuse FG of ripping it off in every aspect. I barely see a connection, other than a funny animated family. FG is light years beyond the Simpson's boring crap, which has been on FOR FAR TOO LONG AND NO ONE EVEN REFERENCES OR CARES 2 CRAPS ABOUT ANYMORE!!!! SERIOUSLY!!! WHO WATCHES THE SIMPSONS OR BRINGS THEM UP AT WORK OR TO WATCH WITH FRIENDS???? They haven't been relevant in like 15 years. It blows my mind that half the negative reviews on here are worshiping at the altar of that dumb show, featuring yellow people with blue hair and pointy heads, that hasn't held my attention since day one.South Park and Fam. Guy are showing their age as well at this point, and the cut-away scenes and such are a bit overused in place of plot material or timely commentary, etc. but they are still some of the best comedy shows ever created.","8","16 October 2017"
"171","It's funny how my brother only ever wants to see. Are the stupid cartoons that come on TV. This proves that comedy is easy. When people are watching comedy movies or a comedy TV series they are not thinking I better have some judgment about what I laugh at. No there are not. They are just thinking I want to laugh. Laughter feels good. Laughter is the very best medicine. And that is why comedy is so easy. IF comedy was hard this pieces of garbage would have been one of shortest running TV shows of all time. This show is not funny at all. It is just stupid and sick. Sick is not funny sick it just sick. This is a sick mean n.a.t.r.u.e.d pieces of junk. The people who you made it out be ashamed of them salves.","1","22 May 2015"
"172","With all the excellent series FOX has unjustly *canceled* (Ally McBeal, Titus, Lone Gunmen, Quintuplets, Grounded For Life...), why bring back this one? It's not as good as the Simpsons, nor does it have the creative or the intellectual humor of Bart or Homer Simpson. Why does it insult and the viewer with inane plot points (in one episode, the father departs the plot to engage in violent attacks with a giant chicken for half the episode; the fight has nothing to do with the rest of the episode), but it also shows no respect for the persons or icons it is attacking. Example, this conversation between father and son: ""Dad, what's a library?"" ""It's a place where the homeless go to wash and clean up."" Stupidity isn't funny; it never has been. On the Simpsons, you can tell the writers respect and pay homage to what they are parodying (Marge's sister standing before a tank in Tienamen Square), but not on Family Guy. When Mel Gibson did the Simpsons, he was allowed to lampoon his Mad Max character and showcase his fondness for the Three Stooges. When Mel was featured on Family Guy, he was insultingly turned into a Biblical terrorist who hunts down the father and mother for stealing a celluloid movie. In another episode, the teenage daughter is forced to lose her virginity in front of a studio audience on Network TV. The football-headed infant on the show constantly conspires to kill his mother and take over the world, his older brother doesn't think and doesn't want to and the daughter seems normal till you realize how neurotic she is. The supporting characters are paper-thin entities without the depth of say Moe Syzlak, Ned Flanders, Clancy Wiggum or Seymour Skinner. The whole series occurs in a world devoid of logic or common sense and borders on a surreal insanity where no matter how stupid the father is, everything he says is somehow true. At least on The Simpsons, there is a rational pattern to the madness. But why does this idiotic series have a cult status? Despite being shallow and asinine, it is top notch animation and it doesn't make you think. It's irrelevant, it's insulting, it's nonsensical and it's only as funny as a fart joke. Why do people watch it? Probably out of morbid curiosity to find out how far down low it can sink trying to be funny or just because the remote control is on the television. It's still better than any episode of King of the Hill (a show that has been dragged WAY past its expiration date), but it will never reach the iconic status of The Simpsons.",NA,"26 August 2005"
"173","It's a hilarious show, but one thing that I love from this show is that it is aware that it is a Simpsons spin-off ,that they rely on cutaways and pop culture references.. But they joke about it!!","10","16 April 2021"
"174","This is a brilliant series along the same lines of Simpsons. Following a family as they go through life and problems etc. Slightly less realistic than Simpsons, talking baby and dog anyone? Family Guy goes where SImpsons or Futurama dares not, reaching past into the sicker jokes and more racy gags. And believe me, it works! Almost all the gags hit the mark and they'll have you in stitches(especially the random, frequent flashbacks!) When my brother first showed me this I wasn't hooked but after a few episodes I was hooked. You will be 2. 10/10 for a truly brilliant show. COngrats to Seth Macfarlane for bringing this show to life. :)","10","20 November 2008"
"175","Despite the apparent structural similarity with The Simpsons - loud fat dad, housewifey mum, 3 children, a pet, typical suburban home, Family Guy is actually functionally and stylistically opposite to The Simpsons. Its avid use (and sometimes too much) of cutaway gags has been its main stay since the first season. While some hit the nail on the head (The Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito bit in Season 5 is spine-snappingly hilarious), others are less successful, coming across as contrived. And they can be annoying, especially when they don't advance the story line. (The Jesus bits are entirely unfunny and insulting)The chemistry between Stewie and Brian Griffin lends itself to pure comedy gold, so much so that Chris and Meg only manage to fulfill the role of the obligatory teenagers in your typical dysfunctional family.However, the feature film Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, is MINDNUMBINGLY horrible. Thank goodness it went straight to DVD.Contrary to tiresome comparisons with the perennial Simpsons, Seth Macfarlane's approach with Family Guy is actually very different - it's much more politically incorrect, and amazingly, a lot more brazen.Creator of Ren and Stimpy, John Kricfalusi, famously criticized Family Guy for having ""extremely low"" graphic standards from a cartoonist's standpoint. I don't think it looks that bad though, the detailing and accuracy of some of the spoofs are quite successful.All in all, a great series to go with a great big bowl of chips smothered in ranch sauce and ass jokes.","7","11 June 2008"
"176","The smartest show when it comes to comedy. if you watch this you can clearly see hundreds of references to amazing movies and tv shows. kind of like robot chicken when they used tons of jokes from classic tv shows. the favorite character as a kid was always peter.","10","30 August 2018"
"177","I find the show either very funny, or too stupid. The show is a hit and miss with me. The too stupid humor I can usually see a mile away. Kick in the groin type of humor. The parody of pop culture humor is great. I love the Star Wars parody. I either watch the whole show or just pieces of an episode. When family guy hits a good rhythm the show is hilarious. I notice t v producers can get away with sicker humor with cartoons. I guess real life people are harder to get away with risky humor compared to animation. I give Family guy either a three or nine depending on the episode. That would give the show a six out of ten. Family guy is the modern day Simpsons.","6","24 May 2011"
"178","The humor isn't clean and you'll definitely be offended if you're offended by South Park. Great for a laugh but you need to be able to not take yourself so seriously","8","23 February 2019"
"179","Family Guy is an animated cartoon created by Seth MacFarlane and first aired in 1999. MacFarlane voices many of the Family Guy characters, though there are other voice actors. The daughter, Meg, is voiced by Mila Kunis, the older son, Chris, is voiced by Seth Green, and the mother, Lois, is voiced by Alex Borstein. In my opinion, MacFarlane has surprised me, and has proved himself to be wonderful at providing different voices. I was amazed when I found out how many voices he performed. To that, I give him two thumbs up.The show itself is funny at times. When I first saw it, I laughed at some of the randomness and crazy jokes. But lately, I've been thinking...is it really that funny? I have re-watched many episodes, and a lot of them are rather pointless, mainly season 4. Seasons 1-3 were the best at combining randomness with a good plot-line. It actually had some rather creative ideas, like the ""big-ass pinata"" for instance. I laughed at that. Season 4 overdoes it way too much, as well as other things.One of the problems I have with season 4 is its flashbacks and cutaways. Even more annoying is the ""regular speech."" It was funny for an episode or two, but they use it as a basis for its comedy, which is not a good thing. It seems that many episodes of season 4 have this now, and I have no clue how long it will last. In these situations, I usually am frustrated and desperate to move on.Another thing that has been done incorrectly is its overuse of slapstick. For season 4, that seems to be the basis of its comedy, which again, is a bad thing. The throwing up thing was mildly funny, but it lost its touch after about 5 or 10 seconds worth of throwing up. Okay, we get it, they're throwing up, it's funny, you don't need to show us anymore, we get the point! Finally, another thing I am absolutely tired of is all the ""Meg bashing."" Seriously, what did she ever do to get picked on so much? I mean, she might not supposed to be popular, but it's even worse to be picked on. A lot of Family Guy fans will criticize me for having this opinion and rebuttal by saying it's funny. To me, it's not funny. It is tasteless and lacking in any point. Do people really think it's funny to pick on someone that hasn't done anything wrong? I don't, and there's nothing funny about that. I mean seriously, where's the humor? What's supposed funny about it? I think she is cute and should get revenge in season 5.Something else to consider about this show is Seth MacFarlane himself. He has been criticized by many, and he often takes jokes too far. The Elizabeth Smart joke was not funny and just horrible.This show is good, but I think it should clean up its act and make improvements here and there. Would I recommend viewing it? I would recommend seasons 1-3 and maybe some episodes of season 4. But some of the last episodes, Petergeist and Untitled Griffin Family History, are among THE WORST Family Guy episodes EVER, so I would not recommend those.","9","4 July 2006"
"180","......is that they finally realized what a piece of crap this show was and took it off the air.  Family Guy is one of the worst cartoons to come out. Peter Griffin is just a jerk.  He doesn't care for anyone but himself.  He is supposed to be a ""clone"" of Homer Simpson(which was made fun of in a recent Simpsons Halloween special), but what the writers ignored was Homer, though rude and selfish most of the time, actually does feel remorse and regret at times(he even once actually tried to improve his family from being the slobs they were!), but that part was ignored when Peter here was created.  Like I said, he is thoughtless, uncaring, and selfish, and only looks out for himself.  The episodes are pointless, with scenes that are supposed to be humorous, but are either boring or just plain stupid.  The stories are also extremely offensive, not South Park offensive, but offensive enough to be really crude, vile, and tasteless.  Ignore this ""comedy,"" and watch an old episode of the Simpsons instead.BOTTOM LINE:  I'll start laughing all right.... the day Peter Griffin gets what he deserves.",NA,"17 August 2003"

"184","Do you know what's funny? I'm actually having a Family Guy marathon right now. Seriously, Family Guy is on my TV right now. I'm listening to Peter Griffin sing.I love this show. It's freaking hilarious. It's one of the best shows on the entire planet. I used to walk past my Dad watching it, and go, ""oh, that's stupid"". No, it's not. I was ignorant. I had not yet learned the magic of Peter Griffin. I remember when I started watching it, every opening song, when Stewie says ""laugh and cry"", I used to laugh my ass off. It was so funny.My favorite character has to be a tie with Peter and Stewie. They're so funny, and these are the reasons why I love them. Peter is an idiot, but very lovable. He's very funny and always makes you laugh. When he acts like a child, but not meaning to, he's hilarious. When he gets footy pajamas, and he electric shocks everyone, it's hilarious. When he goes ""oh, shiny red ball"", it's hilarious. When he goes ""butt scratcher! Butt scratcher!"", it's hilarious. Needless to say, everything he does is funny. I love Stewie, because he's a baby that is an evil genius, who wants to murder his mother. He builds time machines, but still loves his teddy bear, Rupert. Is sort of gay, I honestly don't know if he actually is. I think that's part of the mystery that Seth MacFarlane gave us. Only a few people can understand him, but you don't really know for sure who can, other than Brian. And for some reason, he has an English accent. I don't know why.My next favorite characters from the Griffin family, are Chris, Meg and Lois. In that order. In every TV show, I manage to really hate one character, for some reason. I honestly don't know why, it just seems to happen. And in Family Guy's case, it's Brian. I just find him so annoying with his politics and talking about religion. Just stop it, Brian.My other favorite characters, that aren't in the Griffin family, are Clevland, Joe, Quagmire, Mayor Adam West, Mort Goldman, the chicken, and many others. Too many to go into great detail about.Anyway, I think I've ranted on enough. You can see by my great detail, that I am in love with this show, and I think it's a wonderful thing I can look forward to every week. I honestly don't know how it got cancelled twice, but I do know, you can't keep Family Guy away. It will keep coming back.Overall, I give this show a 10 out of 10.","10","17 October 2014"
"185","This show has the creativity that the Simpsons has lost due to its many years on the air.  While other shows have gotten stale, Family Guy has a fresh feel.

"188","For years, THE SIMPSONS was the undisputed champion of topical animated comedy. Sure, BEAVIS & BUTTHEAD tried their best. But it usually came down to a one-joke idea that didn't go very far. Comedy Central then had SOUTH PARK, a worthy competitor. Finally, Seth MacFarlane and his team of animators came along and set up shop with FAMILY GUY. And since everyone knows about the series, I won't bother going through a synopsis of the characters. But typically, the formula for a show is this: one-liners, zingers, usually a musical number, at least one fart joke, perhaps an extended fight between Peter and a chicken, all revolving around a loosely-held-together plot. Overall, the series is funny. Though some of the jokes are a little too off-color, even if you're someone not easily offended. Some of the running jokes go on too long, also. Personally, I like the episodes that feature Stewie and Brian more often. Their banter is really witty. So, take it or leave it, FAMILY GUY is here to stay. Might as well have a few belly laughs, so long as you hang up your morals!","8","9 June 2015"
"189","This cartoon, although at times (most times) politically incorrect is the funniest thing I have ever seen! It is definitely for adults or teenagers, I am 17 and love it! It brings all the things people think and are to afraid to say to our screens! It also brings very random very entertaining scenarios which no real person would live through! This show is full of bathroom humour and is not at all ashamed to laugh at anything. I'll admit there have been a few episodes where I have felt the writers have been distasteful but overall I can not fault this programme! I'm sure many people would find this programme vile and i suppose it does have an acquired taste, (and after I gave a rating of 1 star to the Godfather trilogy many people are going to think i'm nuts!) but this programme is amazing! It is The Simpsons but ruder with a fat man, his skinny, beautiful wife, a daughter everyone hates, a son with an evil monkey in his closet, a talking college-drop out dog and a baby hell bent on killing his mother this show is a must see!","10","7 June 2007"

It's not a classic comedy, it's more ridiculous, childish things that make this show funny - the low maturity level of Peter, the cutaways, the ongoing jokes with the chicken and THAT song. I watch an episode every day with my dinner, often two a day in fact. Whilst some episodes often pass me by without making me laugh and are forgettable, 9 times out of 10 there's a few moments in every Family Guy episode that make me crack up!Not one to watch with the family, but certainly one I'd recommend.","8","12 October 2018"

"192","This show suffers from a lack of plot and character structure and it shows more and more. Family Guy was always about gags and clips, but the first few seasons, as compared to now, had at least some thread of a storyline. Peter was somewhat of a dad and even one episode had him have a moment with his son, Chris. As of present, all of the characters are interchangeable. Stewie, has ceased to be evil and ambiguously gay, and is now just another one dimensional character.Family Guy could literally be just one mouth spewing lines followed by a clip and be about just as entertaining. However, this show will never lose its fan base because of the first few very funny seasons. The Simpsons, what is now a much worse show than Family Guy, has stopped being funny for the last 6 years and it's still on.","6","22 March 2009"

The inescapable, pythonesque (expanding, technologically, verbal slapstick to cartoon wackiness), barrage of humor that a single episode subjects you to, is on a large scale incredibly stream of consciousness, and on a small scale, supremely witty and representative its culture. It's rare that a show will assemble such amusing characters without a single, forced, moral thread. It's perfect, the way Lois' status as the straight woman complements Peter's utter insanity, and the stock goober characters the 'Simpsons'-aged children play, to the replaced by a overwhelmingly more interesting and intelligent dog and british infant. It's worth watching, treasuring, and getting tapes of, and mailing them to all of your friends. Peter's flashback/dreamlife vignettes are unsurpassed.

I like it that even though Homer is selfish, greedy and lazy but he truly loves his family and that makes him lovable.There's some kind of depth in the series.The characters in family guy is just annoying.In my opinion, this tried to be in the same standard as the simpsons but failed miserably.

"198","This show, featuring such classic characters as Stewie Griffin, the homicidal baby, is so funny that it could coax a smile from a dead man. Despite the fact that most of the jokes are insulting in some way, you forget the slight to your culture, beliefs, etc, because it's just too funny! Even the jokes about Jesus and God are hard not to crack up during. The main characters are as follows; Peter Griffin, the fat-ass, moronic husband, Lois Griffin, the sexy, good and yet dirty wife, Meg, their eldest daughter who just doesn't fit in anywhere, Chris, their artist son who's about as dumb as a tent-pole, Stewie, the baby who wants to rule the world and kill his mother, and, last but not least, Brian, the artsy fartsy talking dog who spends the day boozing. This family of misfits makes it's way through their lives in the unconventional and (at times) sickening town of Quohog, Rhode Island, populated by such characters as Quagmire, the horny next-door-neighbour, and Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons, the insulting, ridiculing pair of news anchors. Even though the way there may be gross and twisted, at the end of each episode the family learns important lessons, no matter how they are masked by the jokes and parodies. This gives the show the brief morality it needs to stay on the air - thank god for that! All in all, Family Guy is an insulting, degrading romp full of characters that are, simply put, horrible people. It is a regular splinter in the ass of the censors, and a terrible role model for kids whose parents let them watch it. But, hey, that's why we love it.","10","21 June 2008"
"199","When Family Guy first came on back in '99, I heard it was a good show and I decided to watch it. I knew it wouldn't be better than The Simpsons. I mean come on...No cartoon is better than The Simpsons...Right? WRONG! I was hooked on Family Guy right away. It was the funniest thing I'd ever seen on TV in my life. Each and every week I sat down to watch it and I laughed until it hurt each episode. Seth MacFarlane is a true genius to come up with a premise like this. A man on the verge of mental retardation is married to a boring housewife, raising three children. Chris, the dim witted son, Meg, the geeky daughter, and last but certainly not least, Stewie, the baby, and the most intelligent one in the family, except for perhaps Brian, the family's martini sipping talking dog.Part of what makes Family Guy so funny is that it's always on the edge of inappropriate. The show says some pretty rude things about many different cultures, religions, races, and creed. However, they just barely stop at the boundary where it becomes not funny. Family Guy is ripe with smart, political humour as well as disgusting toilet humour, making it a show that could make almost anybody laugh. I personally love Family Guy's ability to attack everything with a parody. As a movie lover, to see so many movies spoofed and picked on, it really makes me laugh.Family Guy is brilliant TV and, unlike The Simpsons which has been dropping in quality lately, it will continue to be brilliant for years to come.10/10","10","7 May 2006"

They used to have all sorts of jokes, now its much more limited. They use crappy CGI and stewie isn't as diabolical. Peter also sounds different"" he used to speak faster and did things out of lack of common sense rather than pure retardness.

South Park is the funniest of all the three but that does not make it the best of all the three.In my opinion, the flashbacks in Family Guy are the funniest of all. I mean, so what if it diverts the story a little? I am looking for comedy. Not a deep story or a lesson of some sort. There are thousands of other shows that can give you a story or a family lesson. Seth Macfarlane's idea is to make people laugh - and he is a success at expressing that idea.Sadly, it seems that all the criticisms regarding the show have affected the crew of Family Guy. In the newest episodes, there are fewer flashbacks and the jokes seems to be diminishing as well - all thanks to the critics who love to compare and contrast.I love all the three cartoons.

Also I'll threw a talking dog into the mix who is smarter than the rest of the family but oddly still hangs around them. See that'll really make it different than the Simpsons? Fox: Good Lord, we can rip off an already popular show and sell double the advertising space and DVD's. Brilliant. You're copying the Simpsons but with just enough changes to fool the sheep.Seth: Well, thank you. I've already got enough third-grade potty humour and sexual innuendo lined up for a couple of season's worth of scripts. That way people will say it's ""fresh, cutting edge and outside the box,"" plus we can watch the first couple of seasons of the Simpsons and change the wording to a lot of their jokes, people won't remember that far back. Of course we won't be able to get any real name brand stars for guest appearances because they always go on the Simpsons or King of the Hill. So to save on the budget we'll have the same couple of people imitate stars, they won't even have to change their voices.Fox: Brilliant, we have a deal. Now we just need a ""King of the Hill"" rip-off and life would be grand.",NA,"20 July 2005"
"207","Well where do I begin. The thing about Family Guy is, it's extremely derivative, to the point, it just looses the whole point. Family Guy is like a broken down car being toed by a tow truck,If it wasn't for the tow truck the car would have got nowhere and the same story with Family Guy, If it weren't for the Simpsons Family Guy wouldn't exist and don't worry I'm not going to write a 1000 word essay on how Family Guy copies the Simpsons because it's fairly obvious. It's not only the fact that Family Guy creates something that has been already made that makes me really dislike Family Guy there's also the voices. The jokes aren't even funny and they always try to make a gag by being racist, sexist or by mentioning things some 13 year-old would find funny.Considering it's a copy of The Simpsons and isn't as good as The Simpsons, in my opinion is a complete waste of time. So that is why I give Family Guy 1/10.","1","30 November 2014"

What world do we live in where we can laugh so hard at these repulsive jokes that our lungs collapse and we no longer need oxygen but Family Guy in it's place? A Damn good one!This is the funniest show on TV. I was originally reluctant to watch it because I am a big Simpson fan. This is if the Simpsons was on crack for the half-hour and the some. I love this show, even though I am offended b y this.

"209","This is one of those shows where I wonder why it's still on. Honestly, I was a fan of the show back in the day. Of course, that was back in my high school days, maybe Jr. high, but now, it just feels like they shouldn't bother. There's going to be a lot of comparisons, .I'll start off easy with the least offensive part of the review, while the animation is cleaned up compared to older seasons, I feel that the older seasons had better animation. It's not that the studio isn't capable of doing better animation, they had some times where they had great animation on a segment or two, but today's Family Guy just has some stiff animation, in what's essentially only a few frames of movement per minute. I can chalk this up to a more ""efficient"" way of animating, but I think I would prefer the pen and paper approach, as the characters actually seem more alive.Now, I'll talk about the episodes themselves. See, back in the day, the Griffins actually felt like they were a family, and they were likable while having good stories and decent jokes to boot. In fact, if I was gonna give a story-stupid joke ratio, I would say it would be a 80- 20, mostly because when they did the stupid jokes, they were actually sort of funny and didn't go as far as to joke about celebrities. Today's Family Guy,the characters are just so unlikable, to the point where they can actually make you mad. Stewie going from evil baby genius to gay baby, Peter going from a dumb but caring father to a retard that only cares about himself, and Meg, who was just a teenage girl that wasn't the most popular, being turned into a punching bag. Those are only just a few examples, but I can't name any character that is even remotely likable. It doesn't help that the story-stupid joke ratio is now switched around, almost to where you forget what the episode is about, and the jokes that are on there are just random flashbacks or cutaways that make no sense to even have. It just feels like Seth is just running out of ideas, and it shows.My biggest problem with the show is that it just tries so hard to be offensive, but instead of doing so, it's just wasting their own time. If I want to watch a show of offensive jokes, I'd watch Robot Chicken. Jokes about terminal illnesses? Check! Random acts of violence, some that could even kill characters? Check! There are even celebrity jokes that are, instead of just being silly, are just mean spirited, and I don't even like most celebrities. Then we a brief moment of time where Brian is dead for like two episodes, I guess to bring more attention to the show despite it just being desperate, and an episode where there was an abusive relationship, despite the fact that the characters cause domestic violence all the time which should've made the show not qualified for talking about such a serious topic.If there is one word I can really call this show now, it's ""desperate."" That's the only reason why it sucks now. It's just so desperate. Even South Park, a show that has almost if not the exact same amount of time on air as Family Guy, isn't as desperate as this show. In fact, at least South Park can keep a consistent story and still have some funny jokes, and it seems to be doing well these years by gaining a good game for the franchise, while getting a sequel to said game. The show is still relevant while Family Guy isn't. Fox somehow thinks differently and still keeps this show on air. Family Guy had a good run, but it's clear that they are just running out of ideas. I usually don't wish a show to be cancelled, but in this case, Fox needs to get rid of it and find the next big thing.","1","20 July 2016"
"210","Hello Everybody GravityLoudHouseLover2 here and today I'm Doing a review on Family Guy. I did do a review on it over a year ago but my opinion has changed on it. I do Love Family Guy but lately the show has been Garbage. Family Guy has been Crap ever since season 4 when the show came back. I Mean it started out Great with Seasons 1-3 being Great and Seasons 4-15 being sometimes good but mostly Garbage. The Characters also have changed Peter went from a dim-witted but lovable dad to Unlikeable Douchebag who treat his family(Mostly Meg) like Crap as well as other Characters. Family Guy Has a Lot of horrible & rotten episodes Like ""Fresh Heir"" where Peter marries his son to get on Carter's good side & ""Herpe the Love Sore"" where Brain gives Stewie Herpes for no reason.

"211","I'll admit, Family Guy has it's moments... Of complete retarded incoherent slapstick bullsh*t humor. Everything about this show sucks, when has any of this cast succeeded elsewhere? Seth Green? Seth MacFarlane? Give me a f*cking break, these guys should be put to death. I can't stand watching this crap and so many people find it entertaining. I've given this show more chances than it deserves and all it does is mildly entertain me, and by mildly I mean makes me angry for how these talentless f*cks should be taken off the air. This show displays no thought, just cheap laughs. Family Guy and Carlos Mencia and those retards that make the Scary Movies should conglomerate and make a suicide cult for all you stupid f*cks that enjoy this type of mindless humor.","1","14 April 2009"
"212","Absolutely nothing is sacred for a laugh in this animated satire of hopelessly inept oaf Peter Griffin, his dysfunctional family and wacky neighbors in the city of Quahog, Rhode Island. The set-up of characters (and societal criticism) ostensibly resembles ""The Simpsons"", but it's more than a rip-off since it goes to such lengths that almost only ""South Park"" does to succeed in trying its audience's limits.Creator and incredibly voice-talented McFarlane brings us everything from the raw & crude bad-taste menu: feces- & flatulence-gags, sex- & drug romps, senselessly brutal violence, xenophobic & sexist connotations... but also tons of pop-cultural and historical references (like a great Gary Larson cartoon!) songs, puns, drawn-out jokes and sudden weird, inexplicable appearances (such as the indestructible fighting chicken and the piano playing 1920s entertainers!) all mixed together in a hurricane-paced, surreal blender. A family show with an epilogue moral message to end every episode? Forget it!Favorite characters: Brian the intellectual/alcoholic Dog, Stewie the genius/megalomaniac Baby, psychotic Mayor Adam West (voiced by the same!), sex-maniac neighbor Quagmire and Herbert the senior citizen pederast! Also, that Broadway show-style title song is classic by now, and SO catchy! The only thing that does tire me, is the constant bullying of the daughter, Meg. If she was a non-likable character, I would understand, but she isn't... stop! So yes, it's outrageous, offensive, tasteless... and ""totally freakin' sweet""! A show that makes me laugh so hard and gasp with such disgust is easily one of the best animated series out there. Note: based on seasons 1-5! 8 out of 10 from Ozjeppe","8","22 September 2009"
"213","Family Guy is extremely entertaining. The characters are memorable and the situations they get into make it a lot more enjoyable. The Simpsons, while it is a good show, never takes any risks with their sexual humor. It's always family friendly and I can respect. Family Guy, on the other hand, isn't afraid to make crude sex jokes or use harsher language. Those cutaway jokes may be random but the punchlines are either hilarious and/or accurate.Seth MacFarlane takes that format and structure of the Simpsons (a middle class dysfunctional family living in suburbia with a dimwitted father/husband) then tweaks it around in his own unique way. For the most part, it works to his advantage. Every episode, there's an issue that must dealt with or resolved around the 15-20 minute mark. This is executed well and the characters always learn something when it's all over.Sometimes the gags with Meg are vicious and mean-spirited, but that's one problem I have it with. Other than that one note joke, everything else is wonderful. MacFarlane does a superb job at creating satire in his humor and wit. Binge watch on Netflix and you'll see what makes it such a successful adult animation comedy!","9","15 March 2015"
"214","""Family Guy"" is the illegitimate love child of ""The Simpsons."" It's structured upon similar roots but is far more crass, crude and raunchy. Whereas ""Simpsons"" has universal appeal and can be seen as family entertainment, ""Family Guy"" is very American in nature (I never saw it aired on public TV once in Europe) and for adults. As such it's spawned a huge cult following.There seems to be some waging war between ""Simpsons"" fans and ""Family Guy"" fans. No one can seem to agree to like both shows. Personally, I far prefer ""Simpsons,"" but will admit ""Family Guy"" has its good traits. For one, it can be very funny. Secondly, it's daring -- which is always good.The flipside of this is that it's really just a bunch of crude gags without any of the political commentary that ""The Simpsons"" has. It's not as frequently funny as ""Simpsons"" and the laughs don't hit as hard. The characters aren't as catchy and some of them seem recycled from various other programs on TV.My biggest beef is that the show isn't nearly as clever as ""Simpsons"" in the way it balances comedy, satire, politics, emotional conflict and so on and so forth. It's more or less scattered gags in a plot less world - whereas ""Simpsons"" has a strong focus and always introduces surprisingly strong story lines. (Well, through the first ten years or so, anyway.) Overall this isn't the horrible show ""Simpsons"" fans will have you believe but it does lack the stronger elements that ""Simpsons"" boasts continuously. If you're just looking for some funny sight gags and so forth, ""Family Guy"" is worth watching -- just don't expect the Next Best Thing.","1","21 August 2005"
"215","Family Guy used to provide intelligent satire and comedy, but now it's all irrelevant cutaways and fart jokes. Literally every episode after about Season 7 or 8 is mostly cutaways that have nothing to do with the plot of the episode, and often aren't even funny for that reasonAnd about some of the characters, some of them have changed, not all of them for the better. For example, Brian used to keep his mouth shut in the early, early episodes and usually only provide intelligent comebacks to things people said to kinda balance smartness with stupidity (usually Peter), but now he shoves his views and beliefs down everyone's throats and tries to control everyone's livesIt's the same with Chris. I've always liked Chris's character because he's pretty funny, but he just doesn't make any sense, and I'm talking about the way his character is developed now. Most of the time he's dumb as a whole box of rocks, but sometimes he provides people with complicated, intelligent information and facts when they need it? That doesn't make much senseFamily Guy used to be hilarious, but I hate what it's turning into. Fart jokes and irrelevant cutaways. But I guess great TV shows just have to die sometime.

"216","...for cancelling easily the funniest cartoon of all time.I watched ever single episode of Family Guy, hard as it was, and it was easily the best cartoon ever produced.But thanks to Fox and their programming brilliance (No cartoons, let's make MORE annoying shows about kids that sing!  Genius!) it has to survive on Adult Swim's ever-growing fan base.  Really, how hard is it to see that Family Guy would've killed at the 8:30pm Sunday night slot right after the Simpsons?  Most people are too lazy to change the channel anyway, and if they knew another cartoon was on, you think the Simpsons crowd would change it to see what's happening on 'The Practice' or whatever the hell is on Sunday nights?  Of course not.That makes too much sense though.  Instead, they put it on directly against wrestling (aka the highest rated show for 18-34 year old males aka their biggest target audience) or you had to play the guessing game to guess which night and time it would be on next.  Then they cancel it due to poor ratings.  Right....Now Cartoon Network is profiting from Fox's stupidity, and the DVD's are selling like hotcakes.  Hopefully that will inspire someone to order new episodes or get Seth to make another show after he finishes some of his latest ventures (like the animated movie he's making with the Farrelly Brothers).
Anyway, Seth MacFarlane (Series creator, voice of Peter, Brian, and Stewie, among others) has a great knowledge of the obscure, and has an overall great sense of humor.EG:*Bull is looking at a wine glass inside a glass store**ball bursts through the window, breaking everything in the store**Manager bursts out the door*Bull:  I know what you're thinking....
It's the type of stuff that will make you laugh just for the sheer obscurity or suprise of it, and will only get funnier the more you think about it.Now that Family Guy has found it's place on DVD (I'd like to see ""Bob Patterson"" or some other short-run show sell 400,000 copies at $40 a pop) and on Adult Swim we can only hope for more from the creators.
So buy the DVD, and watch the reruns on Cartoon Network at 11:30 after another great Fox blunder, Futurama.",NA,"5 July 2003"

Other than that, no complaints. May Peter and family rule the airwaves for another eight or 10 years. Some of the best moments are when the cast suddenly bursts into musical numbers, often out of the blue.

"228","I'll start my comment with a question. What do the Simpsons and South Park have in common? They suck compared to Family Guy. Granted, South Park the movie and Simpsons the movie were also very funny and I'm glad to have them in my collection, but lets be serious, Family Guy is much better. For some simple reasons!!First of all, Seth Macfarlane is a genius doing different voices. The best one is without a doubt Stewie. Also Brian and Peter are convincing. Alex Borstein is good as the loving mother Lois, Mila Kunis is great as the neurotic Meg and Seth Green is funny as the naive simpleminded Chris.Second of all, all episodes have a lot a stupid jokes in them, but wait, that's a good thing in this case. The charm of the Family Guy series is the pointless humor. Because the sky is the limit if you make a joke out of everything, and lets be honest, Seth M. and his crew are doing a good job. Mount Rushmore is able to speak, Emperor Palpatine gives advice, Zinedine Zidane has an interesting way of wishing someone happy birthday, Adolf Hitler gives a very interesting sight of what life was in the 'Third Reich', Pawtucket Pat looks a lot like Willy Wonka, etc. These are just 0.0000001% of all the jokes and funny scenes you come across in these series. It's a shame that this is not famous in Holland, we have some episodes on Comedy Central, but that's basically it. It's a good thing I visit the USA often and my dad travels to the US almost monthly. Therefore I was able to collect a lot of volumes so far. Thank God, because they are great. My advice for people who are looking for a fun sitcom to follow. Follow this one and enjoy yourself.

"230","Why these shows never work is beyond me. They are a lot more funny than the typical sitcom, but they are always the first to get the ax. Only the Simpsons appear to have the ability to stay alive. This one is poorly drawn, but man it is very funny. I found myself laughing out loud nearly every episode. Heck, I think I may even find it more enjoyable to the Simpsons. The family here is the dad, mom, son, daughter, and talking dog. This show is kind of the less political correct version of the Simpsons and considering the Simpsons isn't exactly politically correct tells you this show sometimes goes very far. One of my favorite scenes of the series was when Peter was pretending to be a patient in this special home. A nurse asked him his name and he looks around for inspiration cause he doesn't want to give his real name and he sees a pea, a tear, and then he sees a Griffin and this of course is his name in the first place...priceless. Just to add a bit to the review for this one seeing as how the execs finally did something smart by reviving this great animated show, and man the new shows are even funnier than the older episodes. It also helps that all the voices are back and the animation is of the same quality unlike Dexter's Labratory which after a long break in episodes came back looking very badly. Plenty of highlights in the new season some of my favorites were Peter's band in front of the prison when they realized they didn't know any songs, Stewie making a fart joke that goes to far for his health, Peter breaking the news to a pal that his wife is having an affair starting it off with the question about Superman II (my personal favorite flashback now), and a scene in a bar where God accidentally sets the place on fire and yells for a friend that is hilarious.

Seriously, almost none of those songs are even slightly funny, and they just go on, and on, and on, each song is like two minutes long and almost every episode seem to have them, especially the newer ones and some of them have like three songs in one episode, what the hell? It's just a waste of TV time, why would you do that? 2. Peter Griffin. Just, Peter Griffin. It seems they tried to make him like Homer Simpsons rip-off cousin, but failed in so many parts it's unbelievable. Yeah, he's funny to some point, but at most part hes just freak-en annoying, he never even tries to do anything even remotely smart, he's always breaking and blowing the stuff up, he's unbelievably selfish to the point where you see him more like a mad psychotic villain, than cute, childish or in any kind likable character, sometimes you just wish you could jump into the screen and smash his stupid head into the wall.Well and that's about it from my point of view, I could go on ranting on some other little things I hate about FG, but I guess they're not worth mentioning. If you can deal with constant pointless singing segments, maniac main character, which never really gets punished for his crimes and which you're supposed to like. And if bestiality and evil babies is your cup of tea, than I guess you'll like this show. Even if it's not - give it a try, it's worth it in most part.","7","16 July 2009"
"241","Now before i start i want to say that i am a fan of family guy, drawn together, south park and the simpsons. As you should already know there's a war going on between every prime time animation comedy show.Family guy is my favourite of these shows. I prefer Family guy because it's more hard core than the simpsons. ""Ohhhh homer's taking marjuana!"" ""Yeah well in Family guy meg and her boyfriend had ear sex!"" See what i mean? And obviously Family guy is probably the lesser of all the animation shows on air.What i love about family guy is the flashback humour. Most other shows have funny flashbacks but the humour in family guy flashbacks are far more hilarious. Like jokes they make about movies like: ""We now return to Masterbater and Commander"" While others find that immature they have to face that humour is like that now. Slipping over a bannana skin and landing on the floor isn't funny anymore folks Well i've said enough hopefully you get the idea of how funny family guy is.","10","19 July 2007"

"244","Family Guy has just come over to England, aired in Rupert (Fox) Murdoch's Sky satellite service (like The Simpsons, The PJs,  King of the Hill and Futurama before it). It's being aired straight after the much-hyped (and not bad at all) Futurama,  but it doesn't suffer in comparison to Groening's new opus; in fact, given the weight of expectation on the ""Simpsons in Space"" it's started off better. Creator Seth MacFarlane (only 25, doesn't it make you sick?) has diligently combined several successful formats - dopey but loveable Homer-type dad, over-the-top Dr Evil-type villain (except in nappies), wiser-than-his owner dog (as in Wallace and Gromit, a massive UK claymation success less well received in the States). But characters are nothing without writing, and where Family Guy scores high is the rapidfire joke quotient - and in particular the TV references; nearly a dozen in the second show alone, from witty skits of NYPD Blue, Roadrunner and Scooby Doo to quick references to such TV tittletattle as Rosie O'Donnell's adoption of a child. Maybe MacFarlane has set off at too high a pace and the series will lag, but in the meantime, buckle up your seatbelt and enjoy intelligent TV for the short attention-span generation.",NA,"29 September 1999"
"245","What can I say, except for this is the only show to ever top the Simpsons. (Except Duckman, but that sadly went off the air.)  I do think they sure work on making sure Peter doesn't get any more Homer-like.  Other than that, it's perfect.""Peter!  I'm holding hooters!""",NA,"23 July 2001"
"246","The continuing adventures of an incompetent father, a forgiving wife, a dumb son, a clever daughter, a madman genius baby and an intelligent dog that likes a drink.Sound familiar?  The set-up is a little Simpsons-esque.  Peter is a fool like Homer, who tries to do right by his family. Lois is a strong mother who forgives like Marge, but that's where it ends in terms of characters.  The adventures they get involved in are OTT like the Simpsons and are humorous but with a moral every time.The majority of the jokes are pop-reference with plenty of cruel swipes. Some happen in flashback style memories, others come from the characters themselves.  Peter is funny because he is a fool (e.g. Hanson's tour bus breaks down in front of his house, only for him to exclaim `it's the children of the corn!' and open fire on them).  However he isn't as well developed as Homer and often struggles to carry the show by himself.  Lois isn't very good and doesn't get many jokes (unlike Marge).  The kids are not too good either -neither Meg or Chris have the wit or character of Bart and Lisa.  Of the babies Stewie is the highlight of every show.  His English accent and his manic plans and homicidal tendencies are hilarious.  The dog, Brian is also funny and is by far the most intelligent member of the family.The problem with it is that it isn't as clever, intelligent or as sharp as Simpsons.  The animated series needs a certain depth if it's going to win over the adult market.  This has plenty of pop-references and plenty of imaginative scenes that are funny - but it lacks consistency and clever script writing.  Some of the episodes have thin story lines that aren't developed well and some of jokes aren't funny.  The strength of the Simpsons is that the scripts are consistently sharp and well written.  That is the main weakness here.  The second is that the characters are well developed - with the possible exception of Peter.  They all tend to trade on their traits - i.e. the baby is mad, the drunk is an intelligent drinker, Meg is clever and embarrassed etc.  You don't feel like you know them any better even having watch 2 series worth of them.Some of the jokes are not intelligent either - but think they are.  It makes too many jokes about Hitler, Jews and ethnic minorities.  Many of these aren't funny and seem to be lazy swipes at the respective communities, it almost makes it worse that these jokes come from a distinctly white WASP family.  In fairness this doesn't happen too often but when they do they leave a nasty taste in the mouth.Overall, it's regularly very funny but if it's well developed characters, intelligent scripts, clever references and consistently funny episodes then the Simpsons is the family for you my friend.  This is a second place - but not a close one.",NA,"28 January 2002"
"247","Family Guy is amazing, great story lines, voices, acting!! brilliant!! This Show is mainly spoofing The Simpsons. with its rude language, sexual humour and homicidal babies. Peter Griffen: he is just the same as Homer Simpson, fat, lazy and is only interested in one thing SEX!! Lois Griffen: is the loving wife of Peter and she is always trying to do the right thing for her family to fit in, she has also has the same qualities as Marge Simpson, loving and caring mother. Meg Griffen: she is not a hip, beautiful or popular teenager and she is always trying to fit in- Lisa Simpson is also like meg- a intelligent girl but shes a geek- also is allergic to peanuts! Chris Griffen: he is the oldest out of all three and also the dumbest, he has the same qualities as Bart Simpson and he has a evil monkey in his closet which threatens to kill him. Stewie Griffen: is nothing at all like Maggie Simpson because she never plots to kill Marge the way Stewie tries to kill of Lois by any means. he always is plotting out different ways to try and get rid of each family member using his secret laboratory (spoof of Dexters lab) he has also got a rather camp side to him, which is noticeable when he wears Lois' lipstick. Brian the Dog: smarter than the hole family and mainly does the commentary to what is happening in the scene. Overall i highly recommend this to Southpark, Simpsons and King of the hill fans!! this is a very funny comedy!! 10/10",NA,"31 January 2005"
"248","I wouldn't be the first to admit that the Season One of 'Family Guy' was pretty lackluster - they were going for average jokes that were fillers in FOX's hit 'The Simpsons'.  I sorta forgot about the show until my friend's brought it back up in mid-2000, when FOX was airing it as summer replacement for 'That '70s Show' or something. And sweet mother of God, I was in heaven.  'Family Guy' meshed very funny one-liners with drop dead jump-cuts, which was their main appeal when first premiered.  The show was done without a moral lesson at the end which, noticeable or not, is a part of most 'Simpsons' episodes.Stewie was a gold mine of a character.  There was no explanation for his character, nor Brian's, and that made everything that much odder.  He was the exact parallel of Maggie Simpson - a loudmouth baby that steals the show. But it's the other characters, like Quagmire and the news anchors, that give the show its bold flavor.  Their completely out there.  Quagmire is a one-liner-per-second, constantly flaunting his 'sexual prowess' and just raising the notch in the show's comedy bar. And then there are the guest stars and/or rips on celebrities and popular figures from any time.  What happens when God invents Tiny Poppers? Einstein brings the oven door over his head and steals the idea.  A seemingly empty space is Kate Moss turned to the side.  Norm McDonald as Death has sex with his girlfriend in his car (another fantastic flashback) to only cause her death. and continue the act nonetheless.It isn't 'South Park'.  It isn't 'The Simpsons'.  It's something in the middle, a clever mixture of wit and shock that can - and most likely will - take the animated sitcom crown once it returns for its third season in the spring of 2001.",NA,"19 January 2001"
"249","Dysfunctional family, anyone? Unfairly dismissed by some, Family Guy is a funny sex comedy. I never laughed so hard in my life. Brian's car is always getting into accidents on the way to California. After reading some of the negative reviews on here, I just have to say that some people really don't get it. Family Guy isn't complex at all. I am not saying the series is a classic, but it is pleasant. The characters actually have a lot of depth. Disagreements are settled by fistfights. I actually know places and people, some that might pass for the world in Family Guy. I finished this series thinking, ""There are people out there really like this.""","7","22 August 2014"
"250","I used to watch this show religiously. I never missed an episodeand if there was only a rerun on that night I would watch it. At thevery least fox could air a rerun every now and then.

"251","Family Guy was at the time a pretty good show until over the years it snowballed downhill the newer seasons of the show is pretty bad the writing the jokes even the characters are becoming unlikable this is clearly a show that's. gone on way too long and just needs to retire along with the Simpsons","3","13 February 2020"

"253","Adult oriented animated shows are all the rage nowadays, and I think Family Guy is the best one next to the Simpsons. The show focuses on the hilarious misadventures of the Griffen family. From insurance fraud to an Indian spiritual quest, this show has some of the best lines and scenes I have ever seen (Peter's flashbacks are great).

"255","Banned by South Africa, Iran, Vietnam, China, Egypt, Poland, South Korea, Malaysia, and India, I can see why. This show's jokes can sometimes take it too far and offend someone or a whole group of people. This was shown on South Park's episodes, ""Cartoon Wars I & II"" which never happened to Family Guy. It was a parody of South Park's ""Super Best Friends"" when they showed Muhammad. Anyways, I don't mind the jokes or anything. It is funny, and can sometimes teach a lesson at the end.. until Peter ruins it.Lois Griffin reminds me of ""The Nanny's"" Fran Drescher with her ""machine-gun"" laugh and her nasal voice. I think that she was actually a parody of her. That's just my theory.I am so glad that this show is not canceled anymore. It is considered one of the funniest adult cartoons that hit the scene since The Simpsons, although The Simpsons is coming back to popularity since the movie.In my conclusion, this show is sick, cruel, horrible, hysterical, dramatic.. All because of a man known as Peter Griffin.","10","29 July 2007"
"256","Family Guy is one of the most offensive, craziest and rudest shows I've ever seen in my life. But it's also the funniest. Seth MacFarlane makes some good shows, and Family Guy is definitely the best! Peter Griffin is the funniest, stupidest and fattest animated man on TV. Lois Griffin, the funniest, craziest, and greatest animated woman on TV. You also have Chris, the fat, dumber than dumb son of Peter and Lois, your homicidal baby, Stewie, your genius talking dog, Brian, and the poor daughter who always get treated like crap in every episode no matter what she does, Meg. Peter is the main character of the show who can never seem to stop farting. He is very, VERY stupid, and he treats his daughter, Meg, like garbage, the running gag. Lois is the smarter one in the family, next to Brian, who is the true smarty in the family. Chris is the son who is fat like his dad, and a bit stupider. Stewie is the foul-mouthed and homicidal baby who was always trying to kill Lois, who is oblivious to Stewie's plans of her death. Stewie always tries to waste her, but she dodges every attack without even noticing. Then there's Meg, who never gets any damn respect from her family. And Brian, slam-bang sarcastic, intelligent, and always makes a profound statement. Man, he's good! The whole show is funny as hell, and really offensive. If you're not offended, or if you don't laugh at least once at an episode, get a sense of humor. And then there's Peter's friends. Glen Quagmire, an extreme pervert. Joe Swanson, who's unfortunately handicapped, and he's a policeman. And Cleveland Brown. He's the only friend who doesn't have anything wrong with him. Peter's fat as a house, Glen's almost too perverted to function, and Joe has extreme anger problems. Cleveland's the normal one. Humorless people beware. The amusement never stops with Family Guy, but like most shows, some episodes are funnier than others. I loved the episode Petarded and almost every other episode, but I hated Road to the North Pole. This is a show where the jokes never go flat, and the characters are always hilarious, even Meg! Thank you, Seth MacFarlane.","10","17 March 2010"
"257","Unlike the Simpson's, South Park and the slew of other animated comedies about crazay American families, this show has gotten better.Actually, to me, it started out really strong. I liked it best when Stewie was an evil genius and not some homo, and the humor was just random enough to feel different. Then it went through a horrid rough patch after it came back on Since it's been on Netflix (season 9?) it's gotten pretty good again. Though early Simpson's isn't just superior but possibly one of the best show's of all time, Simpsons has gotten so painful to watch Im glad Family Guy is decent enough again.","7","30 May 2021"
"258","i don't live in the state but im sure this show shows the American's life style in general .. i might be wrong i might be rite.. but this show is too good that even i can say i can apply to our life style here in JOrdan.. not everything of course... you know not every jocks they make will apply to us .. but in general i think this show can be applied by many people in the world and it will be easy to everyone to pick up the jock they make. Stewie is totally my favorite, its so funny to see little baby acting and saying an adults thoughts , its like he is the one who can speaks the truth but yet no one can really blame him for the things he says because we all know its true . if you looking for fun and a good laugh u must watch this show.

"259","It took me a long while to get into the Family Guy but I like it now. I love Alex Borstein (better known for her roles on Mad-TV) as the voice of the mother and Mila Kunis as the voice of the daughter. I don't understand why Stewie has a British accent and acts older than he actually is on the show but it makes for an interesting change. Like when Stewie was believed to be possessed by the devil when his parents joined a right wing church, they move to Texas where Stewie is now a girl and appears in a girls' beauty pageant. I like the fact that the best sitcoms today are animated because there is not so much political factors involved. You can easily replace the voices than the actors maybe that's why sitcoms are becoming more animated.","8","21 May 2007"

"261","People shouldn't try to compare ""Family Guy"" with ""The Simpsons.""  While I am a HUGE fan of both shows, and do realize the similarities between them, I feel it's stupid to try to compare them.  They are way too different for a comparison.  I would rather note how, instead of being a rip-off of ""The Simpsons,"" ""Family Guy"" is a parody.  ""The Simpsons"" comedy stems from exaggerated but still reality-based situations where the characters often have normal reactions to them (especially in the earlier seasons).  ""Family Guy""'s comedy is totally different.  With characters like a talking alcoholic dog and a Bond-villain-esque baby, the comedy is trying to be outlandish and non-realistic.  At this point, all ""Family Guy"" needs is to stay on the air long enough to really develop it's characters just as ""The Simpsons"" did.  I'm sure, given this space and freedom from censors, ""The Family Guy"" will evolve into a classic along the lines of, but not the same as, ""The Simpsons.""",NA,"8 August 2001"
"262","Being a Russian myself, sometimes it's hard for me to get the reference jokes about American TV personalities or celebrities. Apart from that, Family Guy is the smartest, funniest and most politically incorrect shows seen on earth. The voice acting is excellent and sounds clear enough even for a non-English speaker as myself to comprehend. Animations are good too, maybe even too good for a TV-show. Here we have the equivalent of the Adult Swim Channel, but nothing there simply compares to this gem. Not even Simpsons or South Park. Hope the creators will continue to entertain and amuse us. Don't want to see the whole thing spiraling down into mediocre entertainment.","10","25 June 2009"
"263","10 years ago I would have given this show a solid 10 but now my opinion is dropping. This show used to be so funny, witter, clever, smart, and the animation wasn't that plastic looking as it is today. Now the show is just getting preachy as they push angry political, religious, and other opinions on the public. I don't mind them touching upon taboo subjects because they always have, it's just that they are going about it so humorlessly these days. For example 10 or even 5 years ago they would have had quick paced funny scenes in which it made us laugh & think at the same time about taboo subjects. But now they don't try that hard anymore to make us laugh so much as preach at us during the entire show. I still give this series a 7 but I feel like I'm being too generous, however I am taking into consideration the first 5 to 7 years of the show. I miss the old days of Family Guy before McFarlane became a bitter old man.","7","23 December 2011"
"264","Although I really think someone should knock this butt-hole off his liberal soapbox (like what Naburba said about Lisa), Seth MacFarlane knows a trick or two about being funny and his genius integrity has made Family Guy my favorite cartoon show. The first four seasons were genius. I love how the jokes come out of nowhere and sucker-punch you with hilarity! Family Guy's genius is not limited to its writing, the voice actors are incredibly talented and flexible (who would have thought that Mad TV had talent?) while the sound track simply blows Mozart out of the water! Season 5 on the other hand is a pile of crap. the crap happens to be the fact that Seth had been directing 3 shows at the same time (the other two being American Dad and The Winner) resulting in a lack of care for all three of his programs, the jokes having no punch-lines, and the show being up its own rectum with liberal ranting. With MacFarlane's The Winner canceled and the new episodes showing promise, I have a feeling things will get better even though the jokes tend to drag sometimes (OKAY WE GET IT, THE ROOKIE BASEBALL PLAYER HAS NO ARMS, GET ON WITH IT!).",NA,"22 October 2007"

"267","I LOVE THIS PROGRAMME. Every time I come home and go to bed I always watch an episode of Family Guy before I go to sleep that is how much I love this programme. I love all the characters in this programme they all have their own way of making you laugh or cry and each episode always makes you laugh. My favourite moment has to be when Stewie and Brian travel through alternate universes and come across a Disney one. It's amazing how they can always make you laugh with every new episode, you can't go wrong with Family Guy. If you like adult humour or just a fun programme then this is for you. My favourite line has to be ""What The Deuce!"".","10","8 August 2015"
"268","I give it a 9 because a 10 is perfect, and only Allah is perfect. But that aside, Family Guy is one of the boldest, most audacious shows on television. I could go on and on about the attractions that it has, but that would get monotonous. Let me instead provide something useful to the 4 people who haven't seen this show and tell you what you might NOT like.First of all, the show consists of about 10% random 'flashback' style jokes that are tangential to the plot. Personally, I love this, because while it comprises a 'formula' of it's own, at least it prevents the show into sliding into other, more familiarly formulaic patterns.Secondly, Seth McFarlane has a plebeian touch that would make Caligula proud. While he's hilarious, extremely talented, and I'm certain he's a wonderful gent all around, nevertheless his ability to relate to the lower classes in any way other than stunned disbelief or open mockery is nonexistent. This shortcoming, however, is rarely an issue as there are other people writing for the show.Mike Henry's voice as Cleveland is an acquired taste, but the 90 other characters that he voices that all sound exactly alike are a taste that's never been acquired by anyone who doesn't work on the show. So if you haven't seen ""Family Guy"" before, and you hear someone slowly drawling and sounding slightly effeminate - just bear with the interruption, and hilarity will resume as soon as the character currently speaking leaves the screen.And finally, you will more than likely be offended. Season after season, this is a show that pushes boundaries - not only in what's possible, but also the boundaries of its audience. ""Family Guy"" will find something you hold sacred and mock it, then DARE you not to laugh. So if you haven't run for the hills already, then have a seat, tune in, watch, laugh and enjoy - and if you find yourself getting offended, then just repeat after the character watching the Christmas Pageant in ""A Very Special Family Guy Freakin' Christmas"" and say, ""I guess I'll just have to develop a sense of humor.""Fonzie be praised!","9","5 August 2006"

"270","The first few episodes were actually pretty good. But somewhere around season 5 or 6... it just became... not good.The episodes just repeat themselves after awhile. And the cutaways became unfunny at around episode 4 of season 1. They are so ridiculously annoying, and add so little (if anything at all) to the story line. In fact, some cutaways are so bad, and so long, and so pointless, that I've actually had to skip through them, or turn off the episode entirely because of them.This show copies the Simpsons but makes it terrible. It's so unoriginal. There are some moments that I can safely say are funny (though I cannot think of them right now). And the problem is that the show cannot change, because it's been like this for 17 seasons. It's its personality, and it cannot be changed.I will give it credit, though, because Stewie and Quagmire save the show to an extent. They're my favorite characters in the show. However, I've even found them to be unbearable at times.All in all: began as a good show, which showed potential, but now has become bad, annoying, and repetitive.","4","27 March 2019"
"271","I totally would disagree with some members of this forum, as Family Guy has managed to carve out its own niche within the comedy genre. Yes The Simpson's is one of the smartest shows on TV: yet Family Guy seems to be different from The Simpsons. I do appreciate Seth MacFarlane's sense of humour. The episode titled Peterotica, was out there, when the Kool Aid guy was speaking with an Afro American accent: I am making an assumption that Afro-Americans have an affinity with Kool Aid. On the surface Family Guy may seem racist, however the best way to break down the barriers is to use comedy.As it has been widely speculated, The Simpsons is only two seasons away from being axed: meaning that Family Guy and American Dad are slowly being set up as the replacement shows. All I can say, I am looking forward to future episodes.","10","23 June 2006"
"272","If I were to rate this show when it first aired... it would have a ten.As it is now... I just can't bring myself to give the whole series a ten.The first five seasons of this show are hysterical. There would be the occasional bad episode, but overall, they were witty, funny, random, and extremely well written. The show gave me a lot of good laughs every episode with jokes written around pop culture and real life.Now... it just seems like they've stopped trying.There is a difference between referencing pop culture and writing a joke around pop culture. Writing a joke about a pop culture icon combines reference and humor to create a funny joke. Referencing something is when you just copy something that's been done with new characters.All family guy episodes seem to do now is reference. For example, they took the ENTIRE SPOCK BURIAL SCENE from Star Trek II and ONLY changed the characters. No joke. Just reference.This used to be one of my favorite shows on television, but I stopped watching it this past season because it stopped being funny altogether. They just steal a couple of scenes from other places, create a loose plot, and run with it.It HAS BECOME the South Park parody of the show.In early episodes, the jokes were entertaining, funny, and even relevant to the plot. (The licking frogs episode has some hilarious drug PSA references).Now... it's just a shell of its former self.For me... everything after Blue Harvest gets steadily worse.I'd recommend watching the first 5 seasons, Blue Harvest, then stopping before you're disappointed.Entire series gets 8/10... the average of the 7 seasons so far together.(Seasons 1-4 = 10/10. Season 5 = 8/10. Season 6 = 6/10. Season 7 = 3/10.)","8","1 July 2009"
"273","I thought that the worst rip off of ""The Simpsons"" was the pathetic ""South Park,"" but now I stand corrected.""Family Guy"" features the life of a senseless and dimwitted Homer Simpson clone Peter Griffin.   He has a less charming wife and three children.  The only difference with ""Family Guy"" is charming Maggie is replaced with ""The Brain"" from ""Pinky and the Brain"" in infantile (and much less amusing) form as well as a talking dog name Brian who helps introduce potty humor.The jokes in ""Family Guy"" are either unfunny concepts or leftovers from ""The Simpsons.""  If you have seen at least any 10 Simpson episodes, I will then bet that you have or will have seen every episode of ""Family Guy.""The only redeeming factor of ""Family Guy"" is that when it is not ripping off ""The Simpsons"" it at least tries (albeit unsuccessfully) to use some original humor, unlike the ""South Park"" solution of throwing in bad language and potty humor in the mix when the story runs thin.What I cannot understand is someone like show creator, Peter Shin, a man who worked on the wonderful ""Freakazoid,"" could turn out such a marginally funny program.  What is even more amazing is why Fox has even bothered to pick this Simpsons rip-off over existing and commercially successful cartoons such as ""South Park"" or ""Celebrity Death Match""  reviving a quality cartoon such as ""The Critic"" or ""The Tick.""",NA,"15 March 1999"

No matter how risky or gross the humor, it is ""justified"" by this.<U+0097> A carefully metered dose of ""edgy"" jokes about sex, religion and politics, sometimes death.<U+0097> Shifts from the story into self-referential alternative worlds from other TeeVee shows. This is what my friend thought I would like, mostly because it is so prominent. The notion is that these characters all know they are in movieland and that all their jokes and doings are from that world. So they move seamlessly from their town into other worlds.Seemed like tame stuff to me. That's because of the limits of TeeVee I suppose. See what the South Park guys did with the big screen without these limits. I'm not impressed.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",NA,"8 December 2005"

Ever since Brian died in that one episode the show has gone to trash the plot lines the jokes the so unfunny 1st grade humor makes me want to just completely boycott TV I don't even watch the news anymore for fear of family guy coming on I think this terrible show has ruined television entirely and it should be pulled off the air completely","1","13 December 2017"
"281","You cannot compare ""Family Guy"" to ""The Simpsons"". The only thing they have in common is that they were both on FOX and that they are animated.""Family Guy"" is for the adult with no-holes barred, sometimes black comedy. This series tackled everything, and did it from a really cerebral approach. Peter Griffith, the head of the family is not dumb, he's just ""here"" dealing with life as it comes to him daily. Lois, his wife came from the upper class but you'd hardly ever know it. His eldest son Chris is slow but artistic, his Daughter Meg is smart but not drop dead gorgeous, his dog Brian is the smartest of the household and his baby, Stewie is a mad scientist in training who is bent on destroying his mother for bringing him into this world. Dysfunctional? Maybe. Hilarious, you bet. This show reminds me of what the Farlley Brothers would have done if they made a weekly cartoon series. Nothing is beyond touch here, so if you have a thin skin, get offended easily, then this is NOT the series for you. If you like tongue in cheek humor, making fun of everybody and everything...you've found your pot of gold in this series. I love this show.I'm glad the FOX Network took a chance with this, but currently the series is re-running on ""Cartoon Network"" as part of the ""Adult Swim"" block and there is where it should have always been.","10","10 November 2003"
"282","I happened upon this show in the year 2000, when the Road to Rhode Island episode aired on FOX. I promptly began watching episodes whenever I could, and bought the seasons on DVD when I had enough spare money.Unfortunately, this show has gone completely downhill over the years. One reviewer on this site called it, ""A shell of its former self,"" and I'm inclined to agree. If you watch episodes of this show from the first four seasons, then watch the newest ones, it's like a completely different show. They depend too much on edgy shock value now. I think the limits of what they could do on FOX in the late 90's and early 2000's really forced the writers to be more creative.As for the first four seasons, I'd give this show a 10/10. But I can't ignore how awful Family Guy has become.","5","15 April 2020"
"283","This show is one of the most overrated shows there is I think. Family Guy has a cult following and people swear by this show claiming it is better than the Simpsons and just so hilarious.As far as I can see this is simply not the case. Is Family Guy funny? Yes, at times. It has it's moments where it catches you in a laugh and it definitely tries to see exactly how offensive it can be (which is why it is NOT for children at all) but it's really a victim of very poor writing. The show depends far too much on cheap sight gags and flashbacks that go on too long and pop culture references. This makes up 90% of the show and the other 10% is the ravings of a matricidal infant. Yeah, you heard me right.The show is based around a family with a fat stupid father, Peter a mother who kind of bares the burdens, Lois, a son,Chris, and a daughter, Meg, who really don't say much of anything, a talking dog named Brian who is smarter than everyone and the matricidal infant, Stewie who probably has the better lines and the most character development. The rest are so poorly developed to call them characters would be just incorrect. They are more props to spout off their type of joke. You never really feel anything for them or get to know them at all. They just provide you with a laugh, that's it.The writers to this show must not have much care for this show at all. It is lazily put together and though you may find yourself laughing the show will leave no real impression on you about the town of Quahog, or Peter, or Meg or any of them besides the fact that they made you laugh.That is why I have a problem with comparing this show to the Simpsons. The Simpsons have real developed characters and the writers obviously take time to move the plot along. The Family Guy just wants to be funny so bad that it completely skips over any kind of real development and goes for the joke. This is a big mistake and it really is causing the show to suffer and is probably why it got canceled in the first place.I think every person should watch this once and decide for themselves. I do enjoy an episode of this show every now and then but they do not stick with me at all.",NA,"1 January 2006"
"284","I am a true fan of this show, and having signed up only recently to IMDb, I am happy to see co-fans with reviews for this show. This is just an 'freakin'good show. All the characters have their value added, stellar quality that makes it so hilarious. Lording us over is Stewie and Brian ( the family dog) with their wit and intelligence. Peter is loveable because of his shenanigans and his down to the drain philosophy about a million of things. Lois, Chris and Meg are also loveable with all their lack of wit and ordinary existence, one will definitely find one's family in them. The friends, the neighbours, the local TV station people and yes, oh, yes James Woods. If you missed an episode, some of the earlier seasons are already on Netflix and voila, happy days are here again. The Family Guy is my fountain of youth on top of ice cream.","9","25 May 2018"
"285","Family Guy will force you to spill a puddle of guts, either from repulsion or laughing yourself silly - your call. To put it bluntly, Family Guy distinguishes itself mercilessly from The Simpsons and pushes far beyond common proprieties with more pungent absurdities. Whether or not you appreciate Family Guy's surreal irreverence, one would be hard pressed to criticize Seth MacFarlane's creativity given his multiple voiceovers, hyperbole of characters, and fly by the seat of your pants, in your face humor.Because of certain extremes, this cartoon will have more of cult following than its peers, and if you are not a member of ""Generation X"", some references will be harder to follow. Nonetheless, Family Guy invokes a powerful nostalgia for the minority of ""adults"" who grew up during the 70s and 80s, and from MacFarlane's iconic perspective, is basically suggesting that everyone else who doesn't ""get it"" should just **** off! The reason why the cartoon is cancelled so frequently only to return by popular demand is because it flirts so closely with the edge - no one is quite sure whether to love or loathe it, but the truth is hard to deny! That's why it's so funny! Another unique twist involves the numerous ""swing"" musicals that appear suddenly from nowhere, enhancing the random zaniness which more consistently relates to ""those values we used to rely"". Subversive yet striking, Family Guy conjures a consistent theme of social sarcasm.Some may argue there is less comedic substance to Lois - the show's straight shooter, but balance is also necessary for the proper level of chemistry to work. As with any family, some members have stronger personalities than others, but when the most prescient members are a precocious infant and a terrier with a penchant for martinis, well, that's just plain hysterical! Meanhwile, Peter Griffin is a gigglesome oaf. If Peter was any dumber, he wouldn't have a pulse. One episode entitled ""Petarded"" didn't do him sufficient justice! Peter is far more incompetent than any prudent censor should respectfully allow and an enormous insult to retarded people everywhere - ""Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh!"" Despite the profundity of his stunts, Peter wouldn't even qualify for the Special Olympics! Unfortunately, you could say the Griffins are a perfect replica of American family average, probably similar to MacFarlane's background from which he draws his twisted humor, having risen far beyond those expectations himself! In summary, this cartoon will be most thoroughly enjoyed by thirty something rebels who have their own sense of morality and direction. Conformists and other good doobies need not apply.","9","28 January 2008"
"286","My boyfriend would play it here and there and I ran out of TV shows so I thought I would try it. I've now re watched it multiple times and when I smoke I would rather be in my bed watching it then anywhere else on earth.

"287","Family Guy is a good show when you are bored out of your mind.
It has some funny moments like when they pick on Megs. Although, they use a lot of humour that is equivalent to a toilet.Family Guy is very random. It's a silly old gag show about past events that never even happened on the shows timeline. Just random hash. Peter is so stupid so how does he remember so many past irrelevant events?Peter G is the immature childish father who is really dumb. He has nothing positive about him. He tends to learn a lesson at the end of episodes. By the next he is still behaves like an American.Lois is the wife who is just a female. In cartoon she's attractive yet settled for someone like Peter. Why?Chris is the fat r-tard of the family. He has more sense than his own father.Meg is the black sheep who gets abused by everyone from family to classmates to guest characters.Stewie is the intelligent, fruit and sadistic baby son of the family. How did dumb Peter create something like Stewie?
Sometimes they can hear him talk other times they can't. GOOF!Then there is a talking mutt named Brian a talking mutt who is the most decent of the whole household. This dirty mutt has the best common sense, etiquette and personality. Jeeez! These Dog lovers...
Despite his drug use brain still shows he isn't as bad as Peter, Chris, meg and Stewie. Lois is just there as a prop for Peter.Then they have main side characters and background characters. They whatever.The animation is fine. Voice work is fine. Stories are like a rushed ""excourt session"". Many episodes like 90% aren't as rememberable as South Park and Simpsons.The theme song is alright. It's not iconic like Simpsons BY any means. It's still good tho.Verdict: family guy reminds me of the time when I had a date with a pineapple that was a pr1ck for the whole date.""Ouh! Pineapple, If you pr1ck me one more time I'll eat you out""","3","2 October 2020"

The only difference in style I cn pick is that it's more surreal... talking dog, evil genius toddler, &c. This is a good thing. Enough shows in the world are constricted by ""making sense"", and it's good to see a show that isn't that way inclined. It's a bit like the ""Dilbert"" TV cartoon in that respect, e.g. weird things happening suddenly.So, in summary, Simpsons + Dilbert, with a touch of ""Married With Children"".

"289","Even though 'Family Guy' tends to be very extreme with its humor, it is certainly one of my favorite cartoons (along with 'The Simpsons', 'South Park', and several other shows) and I enjoy every bit of it.I am aware this show might offend some people since they possibly consider plenty of the jokes as 'crude', but you can't please everyone, right? Well, this show gets pretty close, though. I, personally, have never experienced a sole human being to complain about 'Family Guy' (*cough* besides its appearances in 'South Park' *cough*), although I know there are enough people out there who aren't capable of taking a joke. My mom, for example, has always disliked my taste in shows.I digress. If you can take a joke or two which are against an interest, religion, or even an entire race, I can only recommend watching this show!","7","13 May 2014"
"290","Family Guy had been one of the best adult shows I've ever watched. I'd been watching it since I was 11 (after elementary school was over for me) and still do 5 years later. The old episodes were very funny and enjoyable and there weren't any bad episodes, just several dull ones. Honestly, I admit, the revival series was slightly better than it years ago because it had more memorable moments. Yet, at the same time, it got more offensive, political, and violent as the show went on. Peter is the funniest Griffin (I don't even get why he is hated but he still is the funniest). Lois is OK, but nags Peter too much. Chris had its moments, I sometimes sympathize Meg , Brian had gotten meaner, and Stewie is still funny. My other favorite characters are Peter's friends (Quagmire is the best), Adam West (mayor named after him), Bruce, etc. Like SpongeBob, I defend the new episodes easily. No matter how bad an episode is, these episodes after season 3 are worth seeing over and over again.","9","30 July 2013"
"291","""Family Guy"" is what ""The Simpson"" would have been if ""The Simpsons"" were funny. It's tasteless, mind-numbing, features a line-up of largely unlikable characters, and some jokes go on far longer (say, a few minutes or so) than they should... but I love every minute of it.For those who ever suspected Rhode Island of being filled to the brim with psychopaths, your fears are confirmed. Peter is the best father figure anyone could ever wish for: borderline retarded yet blissfully unaware of it, racist, homophobic, arrogant, loud- and foul-mouthed and an endless source of embarrassment through association. Lois is understanding to the point of insanity, Chris is Bart on illegal substances, Meg is constantly igno - oh, and who can forget Brian, the alcoholic dog? Stewie, who makes the main characters from the Baby Geniuses movies seem cute, deserves a show of his own, and is the most unforgettable character in any TV series since, uh, that guy from Buffy. The vampire guy. There's also Joe, the cop who learned everything about his craft from watching Seagal movies; Cleveland, the token black guy of the neighbourhood; Quagmire, a malformed playboy with an overactive, to say the least, sex drive; Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa; Mayor Adam West; the list of great characters just goes on.Featuring plot lines so outlandish they make the writing for ""South Park"" look like freakin' Shakespeare, every episode is primarily about cramming as many dumb jokes, references, spoofs, and one-liners in there as possible. For the most part, it works, and when it works, it's more hilarious than an ostrich getting stuck in a wood-chipper. If there ever was a perfect show to watch with your brain on hold after a hard day at school or at work, this is it. If nothing else, see it just to see what the deuce all the fuzz is about (God I'm witty).","9","12 September 2007"
"292","Let me set the record straight for the ignorant ones out there. The show's premise resembles the Simpsons. The comparison ends there. Fini. Period. Nobody's going to give you a prize for making that ""astute"" observation ! And while you're sitting around with your ""knee-jerk"" opinions , you're not going to give this show a chance. Smart , intelligent satire vs. stupid sight (Doh!) gags. Why can't people tell the difference?
I grew up with the Simpsons. I loved them , when they were good. Unlike the rest of the degenerates, I moved on to something I know is way better.Ask yourself why FG has ""such"" a fan following with just 3 seasons in its belt? Do you think we were born yesterday and didn't ever catch the Simpsons in its prime ? Get with the program , people ! There is ""such"" as thing as intelligent comedy !! Aren't we mature enough to enjoy comedy that has less ""pie in the face"" and instead makes you connect two absurd pop-culture references and get a ""gag"" that is so hilarious you'll be telling everyone else you know the joke for days on end? I know I did. Are we still stuck up in a ""3-stooges"" era ? I'd rather live to see Peter Griffin dress up as an amateur Ghostbuster crashing into that mushy pottery sequence from Ghost and letting loose his proton-pack.

This show had me cracking' up at times that I had to take breaks in between the laughter.I'm just glad that the people at Fox had the common sense to pick the show back up... especially since I'm now one of the show's many fans.

"295","This is a brilliant show, one of the best animations ever, up there with Daria, Futurama and The Simpsons (all of which were shown in the 90s) The Griffin Family, watch the show and you'll understand, are all hilarious from the point of their entrance to a scene. The shows great use of flashback gags never fails to amuse (i found every single gag at least worth a mental smile) and the show remains fresh. Go on with some new series! The reason for my 10/10 is simple. The connection with The Simpsons brings you to that between Tintin and Asterix- perhaps a comic version of inter-dimensional relations, Thompson and Tomson featuring in Asterix and vice versa. The clone gag in the simpsons (you know the one, video watchers) has to be one of the best recent jokes in that show, and the Family Guy ones are as good. This show, for what it lacks in feeling, emotion and realism, is made up for with piles and lashings of fun, comedy and humour. No wonder it managed to continue. (Who knows, maybe soon we'll all be watching the third simpsons!)","10","7 June 2007"
"296","The Simpsons was the ""must-see"" program of the nineties. Nothing like it ha been done before. Well now, alas, Our yellow faced friends are starting to show their age and becoming a bit...dare I say it... boring? 1999. Along comes this show called ""Family Guy"". It is only 2 years since South Park first hit our screens with its extremely crude content that was not everyone's taste. Personally I like South Park (In small doses).Family Guy kind of bridges the gap between The Simpsons and South Park. The main characters are an American Family called ""The Griffins"" there's dad Peter, an overweight man who doesn't have any job that I can recall, the mother Lois, an apparently attractive redhead (its hard to tell with cartoon characters), the troubled teenage daughter Meg, the awkward teenage son Chris, baby Stewie (who for some reason talks with an English accent and has a very large vocabulary for someone his age), and the dog Brian (who unlike most dogs actually stands on 2 feet and doesn't bark, but talks instead).Unlike The Simpsons and South Park there's not a host of secondary characters to build story lines around. Pretty much every story concerns a member of the Griffin family. The show seems to do a parody on every movie and TV show ever made, not to mention poking fun at many,many celebrities. Its a very simple formula I'll admit, but God is it funny. The humor is dark and razor-sharp. Sometimes its exhilarating. Yes. I used the word exhilarating to describe a cartoon.Its hard to believe this show has been around for nearly 10 years because its still streets ahead of anything else (comedy-wise) thats on TV nowadays.Very underrated and very,Very Funny.","10","13 September 2007"
"297","""Family Guy"" had done the impossible: it came back from the dead. It first aired on Fox in 1999, then it was constantly switched from one time slot to another, pulled from the schedule and put back on, and it finally died.Then, 2 things happened: Cartoon Network's Adult Swim (Adult oriented programming)and DVD brought ""Family Guy"" to life.If you haven't seen this show the first time, then you MUST catch it this time! Quahog is a Rhode Island town, and in it resides the Griffin family. Peter is the head of the family. His wife Lois tries to be the constant voice of reason. Their dog Brian actually drinks martinis. And then there are the children: Meg is often ignored, Chirs is in constant fear of the monkey in his room, and Stewie the baby wants to dominate the world and is hell bent on bumping off his mother.This is one of the most twisted comedies ever. No one is spared. In one infamous episode, Peter wishes upon a star (A la Disney)for a Jewish accountant to help him with his finances (And in that same episode, Luke Skywalker uses the force to do eye surgery, with disastrous results).This is not a good show for kids (some of the language and subject matter is a bit raw). Catch it if you can!",NA,"5 June 2005"
"298","And Sunday, May 1st 2005 it was proved! Family Guy returned with new episodes! Personally I don't feel it should have ever been cancelled in the first place, but I do believe that this second run could turn into something VERY big for Seth Macfarlane and company. I'm not saying that Family Guy is going to end up breaking The Simpsons record (of course it would be cool if it did) but this will definitely be something amazing.Last night's episode of Family Guy definitely proved that the show is back and could definitely have the potential of being better than ever. Stewie and Brian in bed together with Stewie knitting a little blanket that reads 'Die Lois' was just...insanely funny. And anytime I see Tom Tucker's son on screen it just makes me want to laugh that much more.Thank you Fox Network for bringing back Family Guy.

There are still plenty of laughs to be found here but i think Vol. 6 like the last few volumes is slowly providing less and less laughs. At least for me.The biggest annoyance i had with Vol. 6 is it seems to be VERY heavy in left wing politics. I'm a big believer in if you can laugh at other people you should be able to laugh at yourself but this Volume REALLY seems to shove their political view points down your throat and i think it takes a lot away from the show. Insinuated all conservative sates are horrible places, Insinuating we need more gun control, Insinuated school are under funded, Insinuated religious people are crazy, Bush is friends with the devil.. I could go on and this is just from the first three episodes.Sure some of it was funny but there becomes a point when you're not making a comedy and you're really just shoving your political views on other people.","7","15 November 2008"

"304","""Family Guy"" is often very funny, but at the same time it annoys me greatly. The main stories in the episode all too often play backseat to the nonsensical cut away jokes, and that can get very annoying. You never know whether or not something has happened. If a character appears to have died, we might find out later in a cutaway that they were brought back in some goofy way, or they just bring them back. Basically, nothing that happens on the show ever affects anything else, because ""Family Guy"" is set in a dumb, alternate reality where pretty much anything can happen. In a way, that's what makes this different from the show it's accused of copying, ""The Simpsons"", but at the same time, I wish they could make an episode with some sort of emotion, or something other than tired jokes. The only episode I've seen that has some emotion that I actually cared about was ""Brian Wallows, Peter's Swallows"" which had a sweet touching ending. The rest of the episodes have the format of about 11 minutes of story and 11 minutes of cut aways, and when the story itself in convoluted with dumb dialog, we really have nothing but a sketch show, which is what ""Family Guy"" is slowly becoming. Luckily, in all it's stupidity, there are often some good laughs, so even though this review sounds negative, I do enjoy this show. It just could be better.My rating: *** out of ****. 30 mins.

"306","Family Guy is a hilarious show. There isn't much that can be said about it. The show is very well written and provides comedy in many forms the most common being the cutaway gags. The show focuses on the main characters and what happens to them rather then base the comedy on current people or events.Critics do not like the use of Family Guy's gags and feel it goes over the line in what they joke about. However that is what makes the show funny is they do not hold back in fear of offending someone. Usually if someone is offended, something funny has occurred.Overall Family Guy is a funny show that should be praised for its comedic genius. It is a comedy show and it delivers in that aspect.","10","25 April 2009"

The baby wants to take over the world, and swears like a sailor. The kids may look like your run-of-the-mill, stereotyped animated characters, but believe me what they get up to could never be broadcast in the Saturday morning slot. However, you let the makers get away with it, as these teenagers are acting like REAL people would their age, and the scriptwriters are also not afraid to get down and dirty with Chris Griffin (the fat man) and his wife Lois either.The main reason Family Guy succeeds so well, and what elevates it so far beyond most recent comedies (including the terminally-in-decline one I almost mentioned) is the writers, who pile one gag after another and achieve an amazing success rate of about 90%. I honestly defy anyone to sit through an episode of this without bursting out with laugher at least a dozen times. The storylines are great too, often changing their focus half-way through and always throwing up hilarious twists and turns. This is one show where you know they worked the jokes into the plot, not the other way round.Theres so much else to praise here.. The FANTASTIC voicework done by a clearly talented cast.. The BRILLIANT songs that play in some of the episodes with lyrics that will have you on the floor.. The EXCELLENT innovative flashback moments that everyone else has mentioned.. But a man can only say so much, and now I've done talking I want you to go and check out Family Guy for yourself. You can thank me later.",NA,"12 August 2003"
"308","There always has to be a show about a family where the dad is a working stiff and not exactly the world's smartest person. Think Archie Bunker, Homer Simpson, and now Peter Griffin. I haven't seen every ""Family Guy"" episode, but what I have seen makes me nearly die laughing. The show focuses on the Griffin family in Quahog, Rhode Island, who always get into loony situations due to dad Peter's moronic attitude. Lois is the wife who always tries to right Peter's mistakes, Chris is the sexually tensed-up son, Meg is the daughter with a valley girl attitude, Stewie is the baby who apparently wants to take over the world, and Brian is the dog who's smarter than any of the humans. I gotta say that this show has more stuff relating to sex than any other show that I can recall.My favorite episode was either the episode where they have to hide out in a hick town, the episode where Peter secedes from the United States, or the episode ""North by North Quahog"" (especially the part where they watch ""The Passion of the Christ II""). True, virtually everything that happens on ""Family Guy"" is completely improbable, but in a good way. You won't be able to contain yourself if you see even one episode. Hilarious.",NA,"20 June 2005"
"309","I love adult animation. I loved The Simpsons since Tracy Ullman. I also think Futurama, King of the Hill, South Park, Daria and especially all of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim shows are some of the best things on TV!However, The Family Guy is not in the same league. Not even close. I don't even berate it for being a Simpsons rip-off (which it quite obviously is) but for being an incredibly lame, poorly written, poorly voiced, sophomoric effort. Notice several things about it:> The way 50% of the jokes begin with, ""Remember the time you..."" In other words they're flashbacks or fantasies rather then being integrated into the plot (a hallmark of bad writing). Yes, The Simpsons often do this, but only once or twice an episode. FG totally relies on it.> How all the characters are completely flat and one dimensional. They have no personality at all. They all have very exaggerated, schtick-ey voices and mannerisms. The dog always speaks in a dry monotone, the father says ""Aw jez"" every 5 seconds, the mother says ""Now Pe-ter"" every 10 seconds, the teenage son is a poor man's Bobcat Goldthwait, and the baby is just evil. It would be like if The Simpsons made Disco Stu, the Sea Captain, Professor Frink and Bumble Bee Guy the main characters!> The stories have no pacing. It goes from dumb slapstick to pop-culture references to sappy melodrama and back with abandonment. And it doesn't come off as zany, wacky madcap-ness. It comes off as badly written scripts where several half-baked ideas are crammed into one hoping no one will notice.I saw the Seth McFarland short this was based on (the talking dog at the pound). It was on Cartoon Network's What a Cartoon Show along with the pilots for Dexter's Lab and The Powerpuff Girls. And even the underdeveloped pilots of these two kid's shows where much, much funnier.",NA,"14 April 2003"
"310","Family guy is the best show I've seen for the last 17-18 years. It's so interesting and unique. Every episode has epic scenes and story-line. I love the six main characters especially Peter, Stewie, and Meg. I wish that Seth MacFarlane made more episodes about bringing more decent unity between all the Griffins. I can't wait for the new upcoming seasons. I also want family guy to be an anime that's completely original and intellectual at the same time. Season 15 will be amazing like the last 15 seasons. We need more chicken fights, Olivia and Penelope working together to get back at Stewie, and Lois and Meg bonding etc. 3D CGI episodes would be cool too. But the one way that will be the most epic crazy thing is that the family guy movie will feature the Griffins karate chopping the haters who waste their pathetic comments on their show because they're jealous Losers that can't handle cynical sarcasm and realistic concepts in cartoons. It's the real world people. Grow up! Family guy's character development and charismatic charm was always on track. Hopefully it'll go beyond four- dimensional than ever. The show needs to reinvent itself into a more consistent show with more genres. The animation quality needs to be more intelligent and subjective","10","18 May 2016"
"311","Family Guy is no doubt the best show on television. There is no TV show that can compare to the comedy of Family Guy. What I like best about Family Guy is it just keeps going uphill. Unlike South Park. There new episodes really just keep on getting better and better. If you want to laugh watching TV, I would recommend watching this show! The Griffins! Peter, the big lovable oaf who always says what's on his mind. Lois, the doting mother who can't figure out why her baby son is trying to kill her. Meg, the teen drama queen who is constantly embarrassed by her family. Chris, the beefy 13-year old who wouldn't hurt a fly, unless it landed on his hot dog! Stewie, the maniacal one-year old bent on world domination. And Brian, the sarcastic dog wit a wit as dry as the martinis he drinks. The animated adventures of this outrageous family will have your family laughing out loud! 10 out of 10!","10","18 June 2008"
"312","Family Guy doesn't have much of a lasting appeal and isn't all that funny in my opinion. Its comedy relies on shock value and randomness. I do not think the show really pushes any boundaries, but when it does (usually Peter saying something incredibly racist or sexist), it is more often than not in bad taste and garners no laughs. In fact, I think this show is about as edgy as Mind of Mencia, possibly the worst show on Comedy Central (but I'll save that critique for another time). If you need shock comedy, I would suggest South Park as that provides more laughs and has recently up'd its satire and topical aspects.The randomness part of Family Guy greatly contributes to its nonexistent lasting appeal and the show's increasing mediocrity. The cut away jokes that produce much of the randomness, get repetitive and often fall flat. While randomness can be initially funny, it gets old quick and, I find, can hardly ever be appreciated as good writing. Not to praise the preachy South Park, but I think they did a great job of ""calling"" out the Family Guy writers weak writing, and still making fun of themselves.This leaves the show's comedy up to the characters. This is a bad thing. Much like Mad TV's reoccurring characters, the cast of Family Guy is a collection of idiots* who come off as more annoying and smug (when they reference celebrities and politicians) rather than funny. Many characters are one dimensional, and seem like place holders or random plot devices. Often, you can take a line from one character and give it to any other character and no one would know. Brian is the most complete, unique and least annoying character the show has to offer.Others complain about its frequent 1980s pop culture references, but I see the real problem is that, for the most part, the show's demographic didn't live through the 80s, but instead were ""cultured"" by 30 hours of VH1's I love 80s. Any show that relies on these types of culture references is risking laughs because the audience may very likely not know what is being referenced.Many also complain that the show is just a rip off of The Simpsons. While the family setting, characters and jokes can very often be linked to Simpsons counterparts, The Simpsons isn't all that original of a show either, though more so than Family Guy. As they say, there is nothing new under the sun.Lastly, though there is worse out there, the animation is undeniably poor and simple. Some may say that animation doesn't matter, just like graphics with video games, but I would be quick to disagree. As with other media, cartoons and games are a form of art, and a lack of style or quality is a flaw. Both are absent in the board and expressionless Family Guy. Even South Park has some style, and actually contributes to the feel that the show is about fourth graders. And while The Simpsons isn't too much better, Groening's Futurama blows the competition away in all American cartoon television series**.Fans are sure to cite that as long as the show makes you laugh, then it's done its job. To some, it's funny, but to others, I suspect, it is a show they once very much enjoyed but now sit through syndicated episodes not laughing anymore, as do I. With jokes that fail more often than not, that cannot provide laughs for multiple viewings, and increasingly annoying characters, I find Family Guy to be, overall, a bad comedy show/cartoon. I do not mean to come off as a pseudo-intellectual, and if you consider my reasons and reasoning, I think you'll find them to be valid and decently supported.* Idiots as in silly and over-the-top; that is not an insult. ** For some reason, I always group The Simpsons, Futurama, Family Guy, South Park, American Dad, and King of the Hill as competing cartoons and from separate from shows on Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network.","5","30 August 2007"
"313","The early seasons are fantastic, funny, insane TV history. Then the show fell in love with itself and forgot about its characters. Now they're just trying to appease to the reactionary ""edgy"" crowd and those folks only have three jokes so it's pretty boring.But please, start watching it from the beginning, because there plenty of epic stuff too, and decide for yourself where or if to stop.","5","16 July 2021"
"314","I often read reviews and many reviews or comments that people post on the internet. I have seen where people are so uptight about not only this show but so many other shows on TV. The one real cool thing about Family Guy is that it allows me to escape from stress and those many events that happen on a daily basis. From Meg and her problems to Stewie and his wanting to take over the world in his own special way. Its a very funny half hour and deep down inside I hope there is another ""Star Wars"" spin off. I enjoyed all three Star Wars parodies and hope Seth and Company do another. So while so many people take this cartoon way too serious; I look at it as Seth originally intended; its a comedy. Thank you Mr. MacFarlane for the weekly adventures of the dysfunctional Griffins. I hope you continue our adventures of this family and their dog Brian.","9","15 April 2012"
"315","I had loved Family Guy since my younger cousins introduced me to this back in 2007 but now, I just lost interest in it because it really looks the same. I had stopped watching it early this year and I mean, I wont miss it since it is still on our screens.My favorite characters were Stewie and Brian because they were such characters to laugh at and I really enjoyed their bonding in some episodes together, they were such a team. The jokes are definitely rough but some jokes were hilarious you have to admit! I don't know why most kids watch this because it is definitely a rough adult show but thats like asking yourself why are they even watch 'The Simpsons'? They pretty much are both the same really so I can't complain as its up to the kids themselves or the parents. For those who haven't watched the series, I think you should watch it if you wanted to get a taste of the show!","7","21 November 2015"
"316","I absolutely love this show!!!!!!!, Its basically fox's improved version of the simpsons (cau'se lets face it the simpsons are very dry if you're above the age of 9. It's political, irrational, and irresistible. Anyone who says they don't like it is lying, There is a character for every one. Peter, Stewie, & Quagmire are my favorites. Peter because he is rude, obnoxious, and just doesn't give a crap. Stewie because of his amazing intelligence and how he hits you with something an adult would say when you least expect it. And quagmire because one of guilty pleasures is dirty jokes. Also there is an episode for everybody too. If you're the political type there is Mr. Griffin goes to Washington (VOL.2 SEASON 3). If you like more of the sexual and bodily humor there is emission impossible (VOL.2 SEASON 3.). Or if you like any other kind of humor there is dammit Janet (VOL.1 SEASON2).Basicly what i'm saying is that when you watch this show there is side splitting humor for everyone.

"317","If there's one show that i could watch for 24 hours without food,water or toilet, this is it! The adventures of the animated Griffinfamily is the smartest and funniest show ever to be cancelled(Although, Futurama was pretty good). Family Guy follows theusually sureal and over the top adventures of the Griffin family.Peter Griffin is the father. He's stupid, vulgar, stupid, vulgar and, ohyeah, stupid. But deep down in his bowels- I mean! His heart, heloves his family like any other person. Louis Griffin is his lovingwife. She was a millionaire until she met Peter, who was a simpletowel boy. They fell in love and she gave up the millions to quietlylive in Rhode Island with him. They have a daughter Meg Griffin,16, who's real care is to fit in with the crowd at school. Sadly, with afamily like the Griffins, that's pretty hard to do. Their son, at the ageof 13, is named Chris, an overweight boy who's just discoveringwoman. Unlike a lot of teenagers in this type of show, he's isn't abad boy, he's sweet hearted and just tries to do good. In fact, hehas some pretty good talents, like his ability to draw. Next up, isbaby Stewie, a one year old who wants only one thing- Completeand total world domination. In fact, he would be pretty good at it ifhe wasn't a baby. Not one member of the family seems to realizethat Stewie is evil. Last, but not least, is Brian, the family dog, whois the most well educated member of the family and seems toknow what's going on with everyone at every moment. This familyendures everything you can imagine. I don't think there's been onedull day in their lives. And there's not one dull episode. From thestart, Family Guy sets itself out to be a crude foul mouthed andcrazy pop culture reference filled TV show that is actually prettysmart. The least i can say is that it's acheived it's goal. It is brilliantand has more laughs in one episode than a stand up comedianhas in 100 shows. Some people may find it offensive, and it'sdefinitely not a show for everyone, but it does speak some veryimportant messages sometimes, albeit through a very crude joke.Of course, this review wouldn't be complete without touching onThe Simpsons. Every time an animated show comes on air,comparaisons are inevitable. In my opinion, they are two differentshows. Sure, Simpsons and Family Guy are both about twodysfunctional families with the same type of father but there's a lotof families like that in real life. Do you go around comparing them?I know i don't. Family Guy is much more surreal and cruder thanThe Simpsons. The Simpsons is a TV show that any age canenjoy but Famly Guy is a show a father and a teenage son canhave a good laugh at.

"318","It certainly beats Friends, or Everybody Loves Raymond, but Family Guy doesn't hold a candle to wonderful animated shows like: the Simpsons, King of the Hill, Beavis and Butthead, and South Park. I realize that they are all different shows with only the animation in common, but the quality is different.The difference is characters that you can warm up to. I actually feel a little sorry for Beavis when I see him be slapped by Butthead. The situations you see the Hill family in are very personal, private and intimate; you can't help but think that they're a family you actually know. The South Park children are endearing and entertaining. If a giant anvil fell on the Griffin house, I wouldn't care. After watching the DVDs of the first through third seasons the first time, I loved it. The nostalgia was great, thinking about all of the pop culture references from when I grew up. But, after a second or third viewing, it got old, and quickly.The only good character on the show is Brian, but he's not enough to carry the whole show, especially when every other episode he sings show tunes.Not my cup of tea.",NA,"14 February 2004"
"319","Family Guy was quite possibly the greatest animated show ever on TV. I cant belive that FOX cancelled this show and still kept that stale garbage the Simpsons on the air. I cant find one single reason that would explain this show's demise. The characters were brilliant, a psychotic baby with aspirations of world domination, a super intelligent talking dog, and a moronic father, along with his equally moronic teenage son. Cancelling this show was probably FOX's biggest blunder, and I believe that they'll pay for it one day, when the Simpsons and King of the Hill crash and burn and they have nothing to keep thier ratings afloat.Chester's rating: *********/10",NA,"19 January 2003"

Family guy win by far! The simpsons isn't as offensive as family guy but it's not funny. I know this sounds stupid but the offensive material makes it so much funnier! But south park takes it too the extreme, which is good and bad at the same time. I don't like the gross humor in south park. I'm not saying there's not gross humor in family guy, it's just that south park has way too much!","10","8 January 2008"

The good thing about it is that it isn't a thinking show or a suspense show. The greatest animation since the Simpsons was made. It kind of is a essence of the Simpsons, but only I think it gives it a run for it's money. I have to say that in 1999 when it came out, I would have never really started to watch it. But back in 2004 when I found the 1st season on DVD, I decided to check it out and have been hooked on it ever since I saw the 1st season. They have made it now 4 season and are going stronger than ever. I just think this is truly a brilliant idea to come up with.","8","11 December 2006"
"329","One of the funniest shows I've ever watched, probably the funniest around. I'd have to say my favourite character is ""Quagmire"". Definitely the rudest and crudest character in the show and possibly the funniest. But all the character come together, if you took one out, the rest of them wouldn't work as well as they do. I'd like to see the show make another few seasons.I'd have to say my favourite quote is on the episode ""He's too sexy for his fat"" when peter has had a car accident and the rest of his family are gathered around, unable to see his face behind a huge bandage. The doctor comes in and tells them that his surgery have done the best they can to restore him to his original shape. He slowly takes off the bandage to reveal a potato head mask. All of the family gasp; and then the doctor says one more sentence: ""and now, to remove the potato head mask"". Revealing Peter's original face.I recommend Family Guy to anyone who doesn't just whant a bit of humour but wants to be able to fall down laughing and unable to get back up until the show finishes.I'd give it a 9.5/ 10","9","3 September 2007"

"333","Family Guy is an animated sitcom by Seth MacFarlane. Firstly, Family Guy can get repetitive like many shows but isn't as annoyingly repetitive as some s*** like Dora the Explorer. Many episodes center around Peter acting stupid such as buying a ""brain-damaged"" horse or getting volcano insurance or even marrying Chris, his own son which was a big let down for the show; like come on Seth you're much better than that. The few very bad episodes such as 'Seahorse Seashell Party', 'Screams of Silence: The Story of Brenda Q' or 'Fresh Heir' are still nothing compared to the adventures of Brian and Stewie. Brian and Stewie should of had their own sitcom, like the episodes which center around them are absolutely brilliant, including the best Family Guy episodes ever. Examples include 'Yug Ylimaf', 'Road to Rhode Island', 'Back to the Pilot' and 'Road to the Multiverse'. Secondly, Family Guy does cutaway gags, for example, Peter says ""What I do is throw a shot put into the crowd and make it look like an accident"" and shows him actually doing it, except he forgets to make it look like an accident. Some are just plain odd whilst others are hilarious, and you can't breathe. Overall, Family Guy is a great show and it is my favorite. Though it has let downs such as 'Brian Griffin's House of Payne', 'Fistful of Meg' and 'Herpe the Love Sore', it is still a great show once you do not watch episodes like these.","8","3 July 2015"
"334","I swore I'd never write a post like this, but after seeing the South Park dig at Family Guy I just had to.I stopped finding South Park funny after season 2 (excepting the well conceived movie). With titles such as ""Cripple Fight"" and jokes revolving around children swearing, it makes you wonder why they are still bothering to write episodes. ""Asses of Fire""? Didn't they stop and think 'damn this is embarrassing, do we really want our name on this?'The episode that makes fun of Family Guy is ironically one of the least amusing comedy episodes I've ever seen. I didn't even smile once. Sure, family Guy uses ""flashback scenes"" to the extreme, but the flashbacks are genuinely funny and help build the characters and maintain momentum. What is wrong with that? What do you think Monty Python was doing so long ago <U+0096> also shows like Q2, The Goon Show and Round the Horne (the latter two are radio shows) use exactly the same off the wall humour. Hell, in Q2, they just stopped some scenes by walking slowly towards the camera asking ""What are we going to do now?"" yet it's wonderfully funny!It's only my opinion, but I think Family Guy will be remembered as a classic (not to mention being ""the cancelled show that came back""). South Park, however, will be remembered as that childishly offensive show that dragged on and on until eventually it died unwanted and unloved.So, drop the ""writers snobbery"" Matt & Tray. Your writing has not even come close to the intelligent comic genius at work in Family Guy. If there is any doubt, why don't you compare the Family Guy/South Park DVD sales for the 12 months after initial release.For the hell of it, here are my favourite Family Guy Moments (in no particular order)1. ""Where's my money"" <U+0096> Stewie wails on Brian 2. ""The Littlest Bunny"" <U+0096> Great parody of Disney, they deserve this! 3. ""You know what really grinds my gears?

I never thought that I would see a show rival that of the Simpsons in my lifetime, but here we have Seth MacFarlane's exceptional series, The Family Guy. The epitome of the American family, Peter helms the show with the goofball humor that you normally finding yourself laughing at in your own film. The rest of the characters truly give 100% for each episode, with young Stewie emerging as an ultimate favorite. It is impressive when a television program can take social issues and realistic moments and twist them into humorous antidotes about life and family. I think that is what is most important about this program is the 'wholesome' family values that it promotes. While it may not demonstrate at the beginning of each program, by the end it really drives home the power of the American family. For those that may not see this, I loved this show. I couldn't get enough of it when it was on television, so I went ahead and bought the series, and it is the best purchase I have ever made. I just finished watching this first compilation for the tenth time and cannot wait to rewatch again.

"338","Family Guy started out as a breath of fresh air. It was funny, and had a great comedic take on pop culture. Family Guy is just like skiing. With every show, its comedic value takes a step down. Season 1-3 was really good, but ever since season 4 started the laughs have grown further and further apart. And as i write this review, i find the newest episodes have been nothing but terrible and bland. They even have managed to take some of the better jokes from the past and bring them back, and back, and back...and back. Running them over, and over, and over, and...well you get the point.

Stuie is the funniest character ever to hit TV. Chris is a bit annoying at times, but he's pretty funny sometimes. Meg is usually annoying, but some of the plots that revolve around her aren't that bad. Peter is always funny. Lois isn't funny, but she isn't supposed to be.

"342","When I first saw this show, I was 9, and it caught my attention right away when Stewie was trying to call Lois on the phone in the hotel. I laughed and kept on watching. When the episode was finished, i wrote down the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly. This separates itself from the Simpsons and other shows on say, Cartoon Network because the jokes are more mature, not too much, but it's TV-14 for a reason. The quick film cuts after each punch line and cute, funny movements and behavior of the characters make it special. Talented Seth Macfarlene is the creator and the voice of quite a lot of characters in the show. A good theme song, and a crazy family that there's always something funny, makes this my favorite cartoon along Sealab 2021 and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Check it out it's funny stuff.","10","17 August 2004"

"344","It was as if the Family Guy became even more daring and innovative when their demise was near. I loved that show. It makes fun of culture more cut-throat than any other sitcom out there. This is something George Carlin would endorse.I loved how Peter once walked into the Flintstones, knew something was wrong and slowly creeped away. Stewie - he should have his own show.I love how they make fun of themselves. ""Does the family understand what the baby is saying or not?""That show was close to my heart. It competed with the witty Simpsons sayings that all guys say to get a laugh. ""That's unpossible."" ""It tastes like burning.""Now I can say when ordering something - ""I'll have a chicken vagina...""Bring back the Family Guy or as Bart once said: ""The rivers will overflow with our dead.""

"346","I love the old family guy. like, seasons 1-3. However, starting with season 4 (or maybe midway through season 4) it got really bad. For starters: Stewie is no longer evil. they now are making him gay.(literally, he says stuff that implies that he's gay). And I just find Stewie so annoying to watch now. In the old episodes he always says how much he hates 'the dog', and in the new episodes he's always dropping hints that he ""wants Brian"". Also, Meg is now a much less important character on the show. In the old episodes, Lois and Peter said they would do anything for Meg, but in the new episodes, they are always ignoring her, and Peter always makes fun of her. (it was funny at first, but got old real fast) Another thing that annoys me is that in the new episodes, you can't watch the episode for 30 seconds without hearing ""thats more ridiculous than the time I...(random flashback) blah blah blah""Two jokes that family guy really killed are:1. The evil monkey in Chris's closet2. peter Vs. The giant chicken. (they've done it three times, and each time the fight gets longer)So to wrap it up....i wish family guy would go back to the way it was in the old episodes. The new ones are just really bad.","3","29 August 2008"
"347","One of the more controversial network shows of the past few years is definitely ""Family Guy"", an animated FOX product that never really found an audience during its very short run on the risk-taking network. While many in this ultra-hypersensitive society condemned the show for being anti-Jewish, anti-Catholic, anti-gay, anti-female, anti-minority, anti-overweight people, anti-disability and anti-establishment, the show never played favorites and was never hypocritical towards any one group. Everyone in national and international society is a target of this show and some can find the material offensive while others (myself included) find the program to be unbelievably creative and hilarious. The Griffin family makes their home in Quahog, Rhode Island. They are Catholic (even though their antics show that religion is not a key part of their lives) and are basically an atypical middle-class animated television family. Peter is a toy manufacturer whose boss is a blatantly obvious homosexual from France. Lois is the mother and would-be voice of the reason. Meg is the eldest child, a high schooler who struggles with popularity issues, and who also realizes that her family is not as normal as they should be. Chris, the middle child, is a moron who has very little brain power. And of course there is toddler Stewie who has aspirations of murdering his mother (his mortal enemy) and conquering the world. Oh and let's not forget the suave and highly educated dog of the family, Brian. Brian is one of the best animated characters we have ever seen. He ends up being the mind in an otherwise stupid household. These six individuals all have quirks, but in the end they all truly care for one another and end up making sacrifices to better benefit the well-being of the entire family unit. Their neighbors include a crazed sexual maniac, an African-American family (ala Cosby) and a wheelchair-bound former cop who lives with his seemingly always pregnant wife. And don't forget that Adam West (yes, the corn-ball who played Batman in the whacked 1960s television show) is the mayor of the sleepy town. Creator Seth MacFarlane pushes the envelope on normal television programming and pokes fun at everything imaginable from the 1970s to the present-day. Flashbacks and totally out-there situations are the series' primary calling cards. Definitely not for all tastes, but a program that is unique, innovative and completely misunderstood by many in the viewing public. 5 stars out of 5.",NA,"1 September 2003"
"348","I know a lot of people like this cartoon because they find it funny and entertaining, but I can't say I feel the same way about it. While there are moments in this show that I found funny, the majority of the episodes were pretty much garbage. Plus I really don't care for most of the characters in this show, Stewie and Meg are pretty ok. But I found Peter, Quagmire, and Brian to be far from likeable. Some of the characters also have really annoying voices like Lois. The animation is ok and it's probably the only thing I don't hate about this show, but overall I personally consider this show garbage.","1","30 April 2020"
"349","Family guy is one of the best shows on television, it gives me a lot of laughs and It is a awesome show ever. The show right now, it is good but the problem is that the viewers don't like the show, but screw these people that they don't like it, they didn't watch it, and they don't wanna to give a chance to watch the show to give a good rating. Seth MacFarlane is trying to make the episode funnier but they don't give it a chance to enjoy it. All the stupid viewers want to watch is the shows that has a better storyline and always have a cliffhanger such as Rick and Morty. If The viewers are waiting the new season of the other shows, they should watch comedy shows such as family guy to enjoy it. Family guy is the best show ever, I wish the viewers could give family guy a high rating so family guy could be with Simpsons and South Park, and I want family guy to win an Emmy and a Oscar award if the show is getting Better.","10","28 September 2020"
"350","Don't get my wrong family guy is a good comedy. It was a great change from the repetitive canned laughter shows that have plagued our TV's for decades. Characters such as Quagmire and... well Quagmire are unforgettable. The show is an obvious rip off of shows such as The Simpsons, and tries to blend humour from South Park with a sort college guy sarcastic one line jokes the kind of which you'd expect to hear down at your local bar.None of the shows episodes stand which is down to the fact that family guy's writers are manatee's which use think balls to think up plots.OK i'll stop with the cliché south park fan boy references.Just go watch the south park episodes Cartoon wars parts 1 + 2 which will pretty much give you the most hilarious and true review any could ever write.Trey parker Matt stone ?? Geniuses....Seth MacFarlane? Decent but with big let downs.Part of my hate towards family guy is just that it is so amazingly overrated.","7","19 January 2007"
"351","Family Guy is a good comedy, its just not in the simpsons or south park's league. It can be funny at times, but not that funny, the animation is ok. It will NEVER be as popular as the simpsons or south park (it was only on for two years) 7/10
Other alternatives: The Simpsons, South Park, Full House, Futurama",NA,"13 August 2001"
"352","I loved family Guy for the first five seasons, it was so classic, each episode felt like the writers were having tonnes of fun, the animation was also great.
That all changed when season six came. And what a mess the the show has become since then. The animation looks cheap now and characters have been dumbed down into simply terrible people, as well as that the show just developed this awful attitude and I have no doubt that all of this is simply because the writers no longer care.","5","29 January 2019"
"353","At times I think ""Family Guy"" is better than the Simpsons. That's how much I love it. It's not as smart or touching as some (mostly earlier) episodes of the Simpsons, but its very, very funny.  It might depend on what time you grew up (I'm sure younger kids wouldn't get all the references to things such as ""The Kool Aid Guy"", ""Tron"" and ""Flock Of Seagulls""- just to name a few) But for any child of the 80's, this is THE cartoon to watch. I'm so happy they are bringing it back. I can't wait!",NA,"15 February 2004"
"354","I love Family Guy. Ok, its a little racier than The Simpsons, but it is beyond hilarious. Its has a lot more pop culture references than the Simpsons and a lot of bizarre, off the wall humor that makes it a modern cartoon classic.  Look at the quotes, THEY ARE HILARIOUS!Really, Really funny.",NA,"9 December 2003"
"355","""Family Guy"" is an example of a ""hit and miss"" kind of show. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's horrible. You don't know until you watch some of the episodes.Usually, if you watch the older episodes from 1999-2002, they're great, hilarious, and sweet. They focused on how each of their lives were, like if the main bar gets closed, or if something wrong goes on at Chris and Meg's school, and so on. They also had musical numbers on the show which were great! They were all very catchy and fun.If you watch the newer episodes when the show was brought back in 2003, sometimes the show can be just violent, offensive, or crude. They focus TOO much on the flashbacks or too much of Herbert, who started off as a minor character in the older episodes but then he becomes a supporting character.Though, if you ever watch the episode guest-starring Frank Sinatra Jr., it's one of the newer episodes but it's great! It's just like it was one of the older episodes.But all in all, Family Guy is a ""hit and miss"" show. You might like it, you might not.","7","4 July 2008"
"356","I honestly don't think The Simpsons will ever be passed up by another animated TV show (it has yet to be passed by ANY kind of TV show!), but if that ever happened, Family Guy would have to be the show to do it. Every episode is packed with hilarious wit and great entertainment, if not at all times in the best taste. This is not the classiest or most sophisticated show ever, but that's not what it sets out to be. Family Guy is a show that is set to entertain and to make you laugh, and that's exactly what it does.
Peter Griffin is certainly the funniest character in any show since Homer Simpson, and he is supplemented by a universally hilarious cast, such as Stewie, the most hilariously evil baby ever invented, Brian, the aptly named and brilliantly intelligent talking family dog, and of course Quagmire, the sex-obsessed neighbor who has a knack for getting his penis caught in strange places (no pun intended, of course). It's a shame that we are so bombarded with censorship that Family Guy seems to be repeatedly cancelled due to the censors and then brought back by popular demand. Why can't they just air the show until it stops getting ratings? There is no profanity in the show, there's no nudity other than the usual cartoon nudity such as that which has been prevalent in the enormously successful Simpsons for years, and there is little to no violence. It's a shame that such a wildly entertaining show as Family Guy has had such a tough run, especially when comparing it to the slop that is cranked out on TV in general.",NA,"20 September 2002"
"357","I really love Family Guy. I didn't like it the first few times I watched it. But it got way better and I love it enough to watch reruns every time Adult Swim or Fox airs them. I don't really like the first two seasons of the show. To me Family Guy started getting funny after the first time it came back on the Air after it was canceled. I do think the show has involved over the years and got a lot funnier as it has gone. Unlike The Simpsons which has degenerated so much from its Original State. But yeah when I'm home on Sunday nights I avoid new The Simpsons episodes but flip channels until 8pm my time and tune into a new Family Guy and American Dad next. I do also watch American Dad to by the way. But I like Family Guy better though. Anyways Family Guy is a really funny show and gets funnier each episode. Here and their I will watch an episode where it isn't too funny. But usually I always think it is non stop laughing when I tune in. I always like episodes about Brain and Stewie the best. Like the one where they both travel back to WW2 to rescue Mort. Or another Example when Brain sold Stewie's bear Rupert and they both travel to Aspen to get the Bear doll back. Yeah Stewie and Brain episodes are alway the most interesting and funniest episodes in my opinion. One episode that isn't too much based around them I loved a lot is when Peter gets addicted to that Surfing Bird record and Brain and Stewie steal it and break it. Then Peter goes to a record store to buy another one and recognizes Jesus working their. Then they start being buddies. Yeah that was the last new episode I really liked a lot in Season 7. Like the title on my Commit says, This is the best current show right now on TV!","10","19 October 2009"
"358","I had enjoyed Family Guy when it first aired. The spontaneous and irrelevant jokes amused me for the first couple seasons; but now it has gotten old. I've actually completely given up watching the show because their arbitrary jokes no longer have any intelligence behind them, and any thread of a plot line has disappeared or become as pathetic as the humour. Family Guy appears to be chasing the absurd and scandalous scenarios. The random, plot line neglecting, jokes have become longer and more frequent. It's sad really...I every now and then catch an episode with the hope that it will return to the intelligent style of humour it bolstered in the first season; however, I don't even laugh! I just stare at the TV thinking, ""What the hell?!""If you still enjoy the random, meaningless jokes you might as well watch a show like ROBOT CHICKEN. Robot Chicken hammers them off one after another and doesn't try to weave in a pathetic plot line.","4","12 July 2011"
"359","This show is a little bit of everything.  It is one of those shows that can put out a serious message without losing its comedy value.  No matter what the family goes through, no matter how thick Peter is, no matter how evil Stewie is<U+0085> They always manage to show just how much this family actually do love each other.I was one of the unfortunate people who missed the earlier episodes of this show and have only recently caught it.  I've been trying to catch up on what I've missed and have watched quite a lot of it over the last few weeks. 
Some of the jokes can be quite controversial; others can be very tongue in cheek.  But the majority of the show is very funny.  I would have to agree with the majority and say that my favourite character has to be Stewie.  He is just so sarcastic and funny.  He never comes out with anything that doesn't make me giggle.Peter can be quite annoying at times.  I especially get wound up when he just repeats certain things about 15 times before they move on to the next line, like the time he fell over and hurt his knee and said ouch over and over again for about 5 minutes before cutting to the next scene.  Chris is so stupid it can't be anything but funny.  I particularly liked the one where Peter said Chris was working on a way to get to the moon and we saw Chris sitting in a tree trying to reach for the moon, before falling to the ground.Lois is brilliant, I love it when you get the occasional episode where she just loses her temper and goes mad at someone, like Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jerry Springer.  Meg doesn't have much of a character in my opinion.  She never really seems to have much to do with the show.  There was the one where she made out Stewie was addicted to crack and the one where she took the family on Jerry Springer but other than that, I don't really see her having much to do with the show at all.And then there's the talking dog, Brian.  This is one of the great things about this show.  We have a talking baby, who doesn't even have the same accent as the rest of his family and a talking dog and nobody ever blinks an eyelid.  I'm sure I would if I saw a talking dog. Wouldn't you?The neighbours in the show are also quite funny in their own little way. Quagmire and his obsession with getting Lois (and every woman in sight) in to bed is always entertaining.  Cleveland, with his incredibly boring and non interesting lifestyle always manages to raise a smile and Joe is just like some maniac control freak, who can't stop shouting.Final Summary: A very good show, well written, original and extremely amusing.  I hope it sees out a few more seasons before ending.",NA,"9 April 2003"
"360","Family Guy is amazing and crazy at the same time. Lots of people love it and others hate it. From controversial subjects to utter bedlam, Family guy will make anything laugh out loud. Haters gonna hate because this show's main purpose of existence is to make fun of everyone in the whole freaking world as living proof that it personifies how boring real life is and creates a differences and that's why I fell in love with the show 18 years ago. Keep pissing off people unapologetic Seth MacFarlane & his wonderful insanely talented cast and writers. Nostalgia is for losers. Stay alive Family Guy because the new generation of fans love you no matter what! These IMDb haters don't understand the level- headed concepts of complex hilarity & waste their useless comments over a intelligent college show that loves to feed on their pretentious idiotic views.","10","24 July 2016"
"361","Family Guy is my favorite show of all time. I have liked it for a good while now. There are times where I would be falling onto the floor laughing at it, particularly in the older seasons. But this show has gone downhill lately.While I was still a hardcore fan of the show during the newer seasons, they just didn't seem to be as good as the older ones. Jokes became repetitive, stupid or dull, cutaway gags became WAY too overdone and just plain boring and irrelevant to the point where I would sometimes lose focus of it completely (there are episodes in particular where the cutaway gags are extremely long and unbearable.) and the characters changed an awful lot, especially Peter, Brian, and Quagmire. This really disappoints me, as I would love to see the fun and enthusiasm in the writers of the show go back to the way it was when they were writing the show until 2010. I actually personally think that the show went downhill episode quality-wise in around season 9, and humour wise DEFINITELY in season 10-11 then. But I still really loved the show just as much with these seasons, in fact they had some great episodes. Season 13 was what broke the straw in the camel's back for Family Guy. It was absolutely horrible and a desperate-for-laughs season. It had horrible, lazy, poorly-written plots, dry jokes which failed most of the time, or long boring cutaways which made me tune out completely. There were like 5 good episodes in this season so that was a plus, but still, this season was total crap and a huge downfall for Family Guy.Season 14 has actually been great so far IMO, so at least that makes up for Season 13. But even if it IS better, it still doesn't make Family Guy what it used to be in earlier times, because the show has definitely lost it's touch lately. I still enjoyed Seasons 9-12, but Season 13 really had me wanting to gag. They really need to make change to this show too, such as not having to rely on dull cutaways just to fill up the episode, and to change the horribly-developed characters back to the way they were in earlier seasons. I still love this show so much. Even if the show gets any worse I'd probably still watch it, because I've gotten so obsessed with it that I'd probably find it hard to give it up. I can still say as a huge Family Guy fan that the show definitely isn't the same anymore. It's as if the writers don't care about the show anymore. My favorite seasons are definitely 4-5, but 1-6 are the best. 7-12 are great and funny at times but not brilliant and even failed at some points. 13 was a complete disgrace. It has definitely gone downhill over the last 3-5 years and it's just so comparable to the older seasons. Maybe if the writers stop relying on cutaways to fill up episode time, find balance for some of the characters again, and find the good old humor, it will go back to the way it was. But, I will always be a faithful fan of this show until the end of its time. Let's hope that we will find our old golden Family Guy again!","8","19 January 2016"
"362","The Family Guy makes great use of the cartoon medium to be able to match visual effects to the dialogue and story.  The characters aren't as defined as the characters in other animated prime time comedies (The Simpsons, The Critic, The Flintstones), but they are great vehicles for the jokes.  I laughed out loud for at least a full minute at a couple of the scenes in the episode where Peter meets his disabled neighbor.  This is one to watch if you have a slightly eccentric sense of humor.",NA,"25 June 1999"
"363","I love this show, just love it. The funniest characters have to be Peter with his stupidity, and Stewie with his homicidal rage. If you haven't seen it yet the Stewie part might not sound funny to you, but believe me, it is. In the second group I put Lois with her wild streak, Chris with the same amount of idiocy as his father, Peter , and Brian, a talking dog who is an alcoholic. The third group would be Meg, though she is intentionally supposed to be unfunny, she does have some moments. Sometimes I think she inherited some of her father's hilarious (I know I didn't spell that right) stupidity, like when she had a job on the sex phone line and seemed oblivious that she was talking to her father (he didn't know either). All in all, a wonderful show!!!","9","27 May 2008"
"364","I'd have more respect had it been an IRL show; but since it isn't... It unsurprisingly revolves around the borderline white trash mishappenings of the standard US family nucleus. Situations usually created by the detestable father, since he's the dumbest of them all. The mother is the enabler. The daughter is the ugly geek; and so the oldest son. The only difference is that he's also fat and stupid; just like the father, and by extension, the show itself. Which is updated to a more modern and adult setting that comparable ones; sadly that doesn't add much to the show's enjoyment. Think of it as a bad ripoff of The Simpsons; obv unfunny and infinitely worse. The only two quasi salvageable chars are the youngest son, and the dog. Which are obv alter egos of the creator. Perhaps he should do a show solely about those two; IMHO.Another series of adjectives that come to mind are awful, unoriginal, infantile, nonedgy, lame, over-rated/hyped, dumb, boring, and expensive trash. It should've been canceled a long time ago, and jumped the shark right after the first season; as a matter of fact, it has been cancelled before; twice! If was never funny to begin with. And it's no wonder, since there are seldom any true jokes; just a series of bad puns and references. And even when they are, they're not funny enough. Seth has proved that he has no originality and can only do one type of show, rehashed over and over again under diff names; voices withstanding. ""Funny"" offerings for about 5 seconds an episode never did cut it. Definitely the Cloverfield of TV. And sadly once again, IMDb ratings and critics' reviews have failed me. I just cannot fathom why; except maybe fanboys trolling and voting down/up every negative/positive rev. Because no decent, average, clean, and normal human being could possible find this entertaining, let alone watch this putrefactive vomit out of free will. After growing up and leaving the pot, or whatever; I'd recommend a much better show, like South Park. A truly funny, intelligent, groundbreaking satire for serious and discernible adults. Or perhaps even said FOX's classic yellow family signature show. Anything is better that this P.O.S! I just don't see this appreciated a few years from now. People that like it should be ashamed of themselves, and will also be ridiculized for the morons that they truly are; eventually. Maybe sheeple have lost any standard and ref levels; and nowadays they pretty much laugh at anything that's supposedly sold to them as funny. Lil' kids also liek Barney as best show evar1 you know...","3","29 September 2013"
"365","This is one show whose life was ended way too soon.  Despite being Emmy material and one of the funniest cartoons ever, Fox had to replace this with Celebrity Boot Camp and Joe Millionaire garbage.Family Guy is one of the few things in life that is more addictive than crack.  After five minutes of one episode, you'll be hooked.  Seth MacFarlane comes up with the craziest concepts.  A talking baby bent on killing, a dog who loves cocktails, plus the funniest and most random dialogue ever.  I liked this one flashback scene where Peter, who's 13 years old, asks his teacher, ""Why did the dinosaurs die?""  His teacher responds, ""'Cuz you touch yourself at night.""  I was laughing so hard when I saw that scene!Seriously, I don't know what Fox sees in pure rubbish like Paradise Hotel and Mr. Personality.

"366","Family guy is the most crudest, dumb, sometimes racist program i have ever seen. But damn is it funny.Most people that have seen or heard of family tend to compare it to the Simpsons but that it just wrong. I admit there are some familiar things about it but calling it a rip-off is just arrogant. Family guy is like the one sturdy branch descended from the bark that is Simpsons. For one thing family guy offers much more jokes and a lot less story; if you prefer storyline and concept then go with simpsons. But for outright laughs and stupidity go for Family guy.And stupidity and laughter cannot be given without a great mixture of characters which family guy most Definitely has. We have the likes of the father peter; a fat blathering idiot, Lois; The strong mother who has her occasional outbursts, Meg; the typical teenage daughter, Chris; the weird awkward type that sometimes borders insane, and of course, what show cannot go without and evil mastermind baby and a sarcastic drinking, talking dog.This and a mixture of other great characters and constant mockery of shows, films, religion and race makes what Family guy is; A true classic.",NA,"8 October 2004"

"368","I loved this show so much. This show is freaking great. For almost 18 years this show had displayed how controversial and cynical life can be in a hilarious way. I don't care what other people on this site said over the years about Family Guy. They just love to whine like pathetic children about not living up to their uptight and politically correct expectations. People who seek morals from cartoons are seriously idiotic. It's just a cartoon that loves to insult everyone and that's what I love about. Extremely awesome college humor and very brilliant satire created by the comedy genius himself Seth MacFarlane and his wonderful cast and writers. I loved all 15 seasons so far. I can't wait for season 16 and more. Serializing the show will be the most interesting and updated thing for Family Guy's popularity and integrity. Stay strong Family Guy! Seth needs to take control of his show immediately because the entire show and fandom needs a reality check and be reinvented. Redeem your show's integrity.","10","8 December 2016"
"369","Hmmmm where should i start?
Well im gonna be honest
i used to love this show,
both started off great. but when a cat starts ages, there comes time when it gets weaker and weaker, just like family guy.
The funny part is that The Simpsons and Family Guy both started off amazing!
Yet ended up in a trashcan.1st-4rd seasons were GREAT!
It was funny, just funny... And interesting,
I actually felt bad for Peter,
Yet in the newer Episodes he's such a jerk!
The 5th season was meh, i didnt like some of the episodes.
And me suprisingly liked the Peter Prostate Exam Episode, It did make me laugh, Even if there was jokes about rape n stuff and me who's such a over-sensitive person, i liked it. so did i like some other few episodes, but i felt some episodes were worser then the past seasons, i thought it was just gonna last for a season. BUT NOPE EVERYTHING JUST GOT WORSER GAHH! There are some few episodes of newer family guy though that i liked, Like Reverse time OR Road to multiverses, but oh well. 
Im a person who cares more about the past then the current time.
Therefore im giving 8/10 on season 1-5 and rest of the seasons a 4/10 (just because there are still some few good episodes)ALSO THIS IS NOT A SIMPSON RIPOFF!
i consider myself a huge old simpson fan, and this is not a ripoff
the simpsons have sneaked some family guy refrenced BUNCH OF TIMES both in the older and newer episodes, HECC THEY EVEN COLLABRATED TOGHETER!
SO STOP SAYING ITS A SIMPSON RIPOFF!","6","13 July 2018"
"370","family guy is excellent as it does some really funny bits like take the Micky out of star wars so many times (to add to that Seth is a star wars fan as you don't reference star wars as much as he has without being a fan of the show) peter is funny in his own right especially when he is being sexist, loris is great much better than Marge from the Simpson's who has weird hair and talks like something from star trek, meg is a bit annoying but i love it when they make fun of her and blame her for everything, Chris is a little slow but is funny with that voice by Seth green (funny guy) stewie is brilliant, witty, funny and is brilliant with Brian who is my favourite character as he is sarcastic, takes advantage of stewie and his love for Loris is really funny as you wonder is it ever going to happen (porbably not but it would be funny if it did happen) other characters like quagmire, Cleveland and Joe are funny,good and make the show more interesting i think family guy will go on to outlast the Simpson's in production as they can get away with a lot more than the Simpson's can but family guy is genius in its own right and people who criticise it are jealous of its successes and that its own or favourite shows are becoming more rubbish i.e. the Simpson's and south park","10","7 August 2007"

Nearly everything about the series is great, but I do have a couple gripes with the show; it isn't as witty, funny, nor original as ""South Park"", ""The Simpsons"", and ""MST3K"", but those shows are pretty much unbeatable in my opinion. The episodes also don't repeat as well as as the previous shows, but this is still a can't miss series. While it isn't as good as the other shows I mentioned, this is one of the greatest adult series to ever grace television of this generation. Fox is very stupid for canceling this show, and I seriously hope that this great series doesn't get picked up by this channel, since they focus on more crap like ""American Idol"", ""Method & Red"", and ""Quintuplets"".",NA,"30 July 2004"
"372","Ignore the comment before mine. The show is comic genius, most underrated show ever. 3 reasons why. Reason 1, the flashbacks are hilarious, who cares if they have absolutely nothing to do with the story, they make me laugh so hard it hurts and isn't that the idea of a good comedy programme? People who think this isn't funny just have no sense of humour. Who cares if they are random, its a t.v. show, you can do what ever you like with it and people say its not realistic, neither is a cartoon, its animated. Reason 2, The jokes are just generally hilarious, Seth McFarlane and the other writers are soooooooooooo funny, everything from the Star Wars references to making fun of celebrities, i love them all. And Reason 3, the story lines are just brilliant and funny, they set up all of the jokes with their crazy nature and wackiness, just all the more funnier.I caught this one late night on BBC2 and have never gone back, i have all 7 seasons, plus the kind of movie thing (Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story), i have several t-shirts, posters and my collection is still growing. I've never got a collection of any TV show before but this was so funny i just had to get everything. Just watch season 3 and trust me you will be hooked for life, the funniest show ever created and i hope it never ends!","10","30 November 2008"
"373","The greatest thing about watching family guy is that you know its going to be different. It is really unpredictable and very originall. simple story line. Surburban, Irish, working class family living in Rhode Island and there daily life which is always strange but very funny. The show has everything to make it memorable. A sophisticated talking dog, a baby obsessed with ruling the world, a Homer Simpson like dad. When you first watch it you might struggle to understand whats going on but i think thats the pointThink the classic humour of The Simpsons with a mix of south park. expect witty remarks and hilarious situations. you probably wont relate to this like you would with The Simpsons. But if you don't take this too seriously this is one of the funniest animated shows there is.",NA,"10 April 2006"
"374","What can i say about Family Guy? Oh yes. It is absolutely funny and has a lot of laugh-out gags and jokes but this is the show that has the most memorable characters like Peter Griffin and Stewie Griffin. Wow, Seth MacFarlane is far or more the genius of animation just like Matt Groening except more crude and adult-like. The humor in this show is absolutely the best and far way over the top.I love Herbet the Pervert in this series, oh my god it is just my memorable moment for Family Guy because of him being a elder pervert and has my opinions on the funniest character in the show. In memorial of Brian Griffin in Life of Brian, horrible episode then revived, aaaah better 10/10","10","23 July 2014"
"375","The show is one of my favorite animated television shows, but some of the jokes are actually racist. You know, one that bothers you in your religion or color, etc. etc. Since I'm a Christian, nearly always they have something that mentally scars my religious ways for a couple of days.Sure, I agree that Quagmire's really weird personalty is cool, but this is like the Simpsons, except with more weird into it. I don't really say this is a cross between the Simpsons and South Park, but some of the jokes are really corny, not really racist, though.The voice actors are decent, sometimes they're really annoying. I'm used to it, though.","9","20 October 2008"
"376","Here's the thing, this is one of my favorite shows. I own all the current DVD sets and plan on getting the next one when it comes out. The great thing about this show is that it's just something fun to watch.It's all personnel preference some people dislike this show because of some of the humor. A lot of the humor has a sexual tone and other so called ""edgy"" humor that some might object to, so if that's you just go ahead and stop reading because this show isn't for you.There are very few shows that I can watch over again and this is one of them. It has some of the best comedy sequences and quotations I've heard or seen. Now yes don't get me wrong there are some parts that do drag on, but what do you expect not every joke is gonna be pitch perfect there's always a few low points and some episodes you won't like.There's a few you do to keep a little bit of your immaturity, You can't be serious all the time so if you want a good enjoyable show watch that'll make you laugh this is one that is definitely worth it.","10","29 January 2011"
"377","Family guy by far is my favorite adult animated show, I have been watching for almost 10 years now and I still think it's as funny now as it was when I first watched it. I was a kid then so not all the jokes got through but now re watching past episodes and understanding some of the adult jokes I have an even funner time watching this show. Although the only problem with the show I have is the fact that I've been watching for 10 years and some characters can get a bit annoying now, so every once in awhile I'll give myself a few months away from the show. My favorite character on the show is Chris griffin because he's played by one of my favorite childhood actors in Seth green. Also I love how Chris just adds onto his fathers dumbness when it comes to picking on Meg. Chris is one character that after 10 years I am still able to say I love that character. Overall I'd say family guy is a hilarious show with no real down points unless you've been watching for a long time like me.","9","8 August 2015"
"378","Started to watch this Sitcom. So much funny clip are coming in my fb, tiktok and YT feed some dark some so funny so i decided to watch this. So let's see how is this series. Too long don't know when will I finished this, still the office is on pending i am on s4.",NA,"4 January 2022"
"379","It's just started being shown over here in the UK, so I thought I'd try it. It's good. It's really good. Very funny, the scripting is spot on, and the characters grow on you right away, they don't need introductions, they are just there, in your face, and you love them. Especially Stewie, he is brilliant.If you like animation, try it out, that's what I did, and I loved it...",NA,"9 October 1999"
"380","Family Guy is just like the Simpsons. 2/3 ""whoo-hoo!"" and 1/3 'D'OH!'The non-threatening comedy is hilarious(i.e: Peter knocks a golf ball into a china shop, destroying everything while a bull is reading the magazine. The angry owner sneers at the bull who replies, 'I know what you're thinking!'), the suggestive but nor so harsh humor is cute, but the adult language has got to go! That is stupid, and Seth McFarlane, the man behinf Family Guy knows it. There's a person who can't stand the show, and for good reason. Too harsh for its own good. Sure, I can use Stewie to help me get rid of some scum I hate, some of them are critics with no taste who got me POed with their lousy reviews. But overall, the show needs less raunch and more slapstick! Offensive comedy ain't funny. It's offensive! And stupid. Peter Griffin is an idiot with a woman's butt for a chin.",NA,"4 December 2003"
"381","Despite the criticism that it received(about the voices, themes and the simplicity of the animation), I think that ""Family Guy"" deserves all the popularity that it has.It is true that at first sight it seems to be a clone of the Simpsons, but the style and the humor is quite different and quite effective too. The cultural references are effective, and shocking sometimes (That is what makes the show funny) and about the animation, I think that it fits very well with the style of the show. And the complaints concerning taste and indecency are exaggerated: It is true that the show has violence and sexual jokes, but it was never intended to children. There are many shows that are more offensive and explicit and that don't receive the same criticism ( Like, by example ""Drawn Together"")Even when the humor isn't ""sophisticated"" it doesn't makes it stupid or puerile. It is just the style of the show. With it good and bad things "" Family Guy "" is a very good show.Not the best, but good.","9","4 July 2008"
"382","As Lionel Hutz himself once said, if it weren't for ripoffs, we wouldn't have nearly as many enjoyable shows as we currently do. But to call Family Guy merely a ""Simpsons ripoff"" is very short sighted. Family Guy is an acquired taste, and if you didn't like the first episode, you most likely will never be able to get into it. I find it to be hilarious, unlike shows like Futurama that stay on the air all year thanks to the star power behind them. There is a way to explain how Family Guy is not only different from the Simpsons, but is also a suitable replacement when the inevitable time comes, but chances are that if you don't understand Family Guy, you wouldn't understand the explanation either. Bottom line: It's a very good show, and Fox needs to wake up and realize that they have a potential cartoon dynasty on their hands if they would just replace Futurama with Family Guy on Sunday Nights.",NA,"4 December 2000"
"383","Contrary to what the title says, I like both shows but ""Family Guy"" has some scenes that make me laugh so hard I almost choke. The funniest one that I can think of is the ""Mentos"" parody. I laughed SO hard tears were rolling down my face and I was still laughing way after that scene was over!! I can't WAIT for the season premiere of FG to start but the bad part is that it's going to be on Thursday nights opposite ""Frasier"" and ""Chicago Hope"" so my mom, dad and I are going to fight over the two TVs we own come September. BUT I WILL WIN IN THE END!! HA HA HA!!!!Anyway, I would recommend this show to people. They'd be kicking themselves when the show is cancelled(hopefully that's not for a LONG time)and are not able to catch it on the tube anymore.",NA,"16 August 1999"
"384","Family Guy is a cartoon that you sometimes wonder why it was rated PG. Whether it's newsman Tom Tucker being found with a prostitute, Griffin child Stewie commenting on how the cheerleaders are lucky he's not after there more...intimate regions or Quagmire...well anything Quagmire says, really. But mixed in with this shocking humour is some really sharp dialogue and surreal flashes that combined with the shows lack of PC makes for a very good mix. Like the Simpsons it more feels at home satirising aspects of society than actual events themselves and like the Simpsons it has a good mix of characters including Brian and Stewie the cynical smoking dog and the dominating evil baby respectively who really set the show apart from the Simpsons. Having said that however, the show doesn't seem to get away enough with Peter the dumb father beginning to remind us all of a bald round father from another show...Also, while the show is great the first time around, it doesn't have the depth of Futurama nor the Simpsons to lift it to their class. Nevertheless, Family Guy is a good show and I can't wait for the movie later this year.",NA,"30 January 2005"
"385","Family Guy is a hilarious example of the explosion of more adult-themed animation that has taken place over the past ten years. One of the earliest and most successful of the genre, it plays like a combination of The Simpsons and South Park, blended together with a puree of pop culture references.Family Guy has evolved over the seasons-and the two cancellation periods. If you watch the earliest episodes, they are much tamer than those that followed in the second and third seasons, almost as if the writers were unsure of how far they could go. Furthermore,the characters, within the limits of a half hour sitcom, have themselves evolved. Brian in particular has been fleshed out well.This is never going to be great drama, and it is certainly not something you would show to the children. Nevertheless, if you want a good laugh, this show is the place to go.","8","4 January 2011"
"386","Of all the current animated sitcoms (""Futurama,"" ""The PJs,"" ""King of the Hill,"" ""Dilbert,"" ""The Simpsons,"" ""South Park,"" ""The Family Guy""), only one stinks. It's ""The Family Guy."" The stories are stupid, the characters are one-dimensional ripoffs, and the animation is flat and uninteresting.The megalomaniacal baby and the hyperintelligent dog are both ripped off from Dogbert, and they are the only characters that have any personality at all. Unfortunately, the baby is merely annoying (and majorly so).Hopefully Fox will cancel this stinkeroo soon and put the far superior ""Futurama"" back in its cushy 8 p.m. Sunday time slot.",NA,"8 April 1999"
"387","This is one awesome show, and here are the reasons why. First, there are random scenarios episode after episode. Second, the series has dozens of popular culture. For example, in the episode, ""I dream of Jesus"", Peter rediscovers his favourite song of all time: Surfin' Bird. I have been inspired to love Surfin' Bird and drive my family crazy with it. The first time I have watched an entire episode of Family Guy, was when I was eleven, and I was totally hooked on it, even though it's vulgar, it's funny! What else I love best about Family Guy is that it even did the Star Wars Trilogy, and I totally loved it!! The most hilarious episode would be ""The Splendid Source"", where it involves Peter laughing at a dirty joke so hard, he poops his pants. Every time that happened, I burst out laughing so loudly, my parents could hear me all the way upstairs, because I was in the basement.","10","14 May 2011"

"389","It is a very good show. Amongst the top cartoons I have ever seen. Now people say it is a bad show for all the jokes where they cut away. But i think it is intelligent and feel that this show has great potential. It is but some shows can have very good plots and revelations. But I have to say I am being disappointed with some episodes of season 12 and 13, especially the brain death sequence. But other then that it is a great show and i recommend it.It is a great comedical show, even if you are not taking it seriously then still sitting down every few days and watching a few episodes for the laughs is fun. But like every show it has it's bad episodes which disappoint me and very good episodes. overall a great show, but be wary it ISN'T a family show lol","10","8 June 2014"
"390","Family Guy is kinda an overrated show, like that one time where I did something that required breaking up the pace of a show with a cut away that gets old after the first time. The Stewie character is kinda like that one time I went ahead and acted like a complete moron and started saying stupid things hoping people would laugh, stuff like ""I'm going to kill you mother"" which isn't that cool since my mom's dead. Watching this show is kinda like that one time I watched the Simpsons. Or any other cartoon that Family Guy ripped off. Peter's a funny character, kinda like that one time when funny meant genocidal, like Stalin, ya know, that one time... Lois's character is kinda like that one time when I watched an episode of the Nanny and didn't laugh. Oh, as for Brian, he's kinda like that one time that dogs don't talk. But I'm willing to let that slide because it's a cartoon. His alcoholism I won't allow though, alcohol is evil, just like Mila Kunis. I wonder why her career hasn't hit the point where she's doing horse videos. Chris sounds like that one time I made an annoying voice that got a laugh once, but kept doing until my friends stopped talking to me. Your basic plot is like that one time I made a review of a stupid show that pointed out it lack of plot.",NA,"13 July 2006"
"391","I got to admit this show is really damn funny and honestly the older seasons are WAY more funny than the newer seasons and guide for the parents about this show I started watching this when I was 15 because this is not a show for very young children it's kinda obvious by the tv-14 aka ages 14 and up rating.","10","31 December 2021"
"392","Family Guy has been hilarious for so long but I feel like it lost it's sharp and random humor at the start of season 6. Although I enjoyed Blue Harvest, it felt like the remaining episodes were ""wrapping-up"" - episodes where the producers made little attempt to fulfill Family Guy's reputation of American social satire.I have seen all the episodes from season 7 and I was utterly surprised and happy that Family Guy has found their true colors again. Season 7 delivers a lot of fantastic episodes and with a lot of jokes about the current situations in America which is exactly what we need right now - more fun.I feel that the Simpsons has lost its spark all together, this show, however, has made a terrific recovery from going down to proving how perfectly satirical they can be. Great job!","10","27 June 2009"
"393","So before Family Guy i pretty much settled on The Simpsons because they were the only watchable adult animated show(don't get me wrong I love The Simpsons but it was getting a bit old) but then in 1999 a great master named Seth Macfarlane came from above shared with us his creation Family Guy and it was like a match made in heaven, I mean it had my crude humor of tasteless jokes so a I got addicted watching every episode and every rerun they put on TV.And after a while I found myself repeating every single joke in my head and to my friends and forcing them to watch every episode with me. And then came the dark ages. Family guy got CANCELLED and I went into shock and bought every family product ever made and of course all the DVD's and overdosed a couple of times by watching a whole series in one sitting again and again.Then one wonderful morning when I was finally starting to stop or at least cut down on my Family Guy watching dozes I got the amazing news that they were bringing them back because of amazing DVD sales. So you can Imagen I was stoked and when it came back on it was like it had never left. So now couple years later I am still addicted and watch every episode every week religiously but I am not as crazy as I used to be.P.S to answer your question no I don't have life.","10","12 November 2009"
"394","It was too funny - I have rarely seen a show that so cleverly pokes fun at every aspect of our popular culture.  Any time you combine a matricidal baby, a talking dog, a slew of flashbacks, and Seth Green, you just can't miss.",NA,"12 April 2001"
"395","Now, I like this show a lot. It's funny and it's fresh. The voice acting is amazing and the cutaway's are really funny at times. It really does make me laugh. I watch it some nights and it's always nice to sit down and watch it. But it does have its bad points.The good: Some of the humour is funny, it's amazing how they have only used a few voice actors, some of the more offensive humour isn't out there to just offend people. Also even their British assumptions are funny!!The bad: THE humour is repetitive, it uses aids and cancer as jokes, toilet humour completely over used, and steals jokes from The Simpsons and other shows that said them way before they did.8/10It's good, but it does need to freshen up a bit.","8","6 August 2013"
"396","I do enjoy this show, to this day I watch the repeats on Cartoon Network's Aduilt Swim. What other show would have the lead character fight a giant man size chicken over a expired coupon. An evil baby wanting to rule the world and a talking dog. I give it 9 Stars *********ON THE POSITIVE SIDE (+ HITS) + FUNNY (extremely funny, one of the funniest shows since the Simpsons) + CHARACTERS (Clever writing in the characters) + WRITING (Some of the best writing around)ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE (- MISSES)SATIRE (Some people may not like the satire) - NOT FOR KIDS (This is not a cartoon for kids)",NA,"21 April 2005"
"397","Family Guy used to be the funniest animated sitcom and my favorite animated sitcom on TV. I was never a big fan of the Simpsons, South Park, King of the Hill or any other animated sitcom. This show falls somewhere between the mainstream family-friendly Simpsons and the overtly crass South Park. Nevertheless, it is about as un-PC as you can get and makes fun of virtually everyone.However, beginning around 2006 shortly after coming back on-air this show started to go downhill and lost its edge. All of the jokes became centered around Quagmire's hatred of Brian or his overzealous sex life, cutaway bits that are drawn out to the point of awkwardness, constant pop culture references, or flashbacks that start along the lines of ""This is more ____ than that time I _____"" or ""This is like that time I _____"". While this show has lost its originality and creativity it's still better than most of the mindless crap on TV today. I continue to watch reruns of the old shows on Adult Swim but once it gets past Season 4 (2005-2006ish) I stop watching.","7","17 January 2018"
"398","This has got to be one of the most overrated shows on the face of the Earth.I watch this whenever it comes on the jokes are hilarious although they can be very stupid.This show absolutely fails in plots because each one is over-run by mindless gags and random cutaways. This show centers around the Griffins, a dysfunctional family living in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island. The main character Peter Griffin is an idiot but very funny because he always doing unbelievably stupid things,it kinda has you wondering why Lois griffin (his wife) married a doofus like him.The other characters Brian,Stewie,Meg and Chris can be funny but not as funny as Peter.",NA,"11 April 2012"
"399","It never seizes to amaze me what passes for entertainment these days...This show appeals to docile sheep who believe they are viewing something edgy and groundbreaking. I'm sorry folks, you're not.It's simple humour designed for immature people. I love the Simpsons and South Park and although they may be viewed as immature, on a latent level, they are so much more.I think I see the appeal. It's a show that relies on an endless supply of popular culture references and other random obscurities. The common reaction? ""Wow, that's so random! I can't believe they ACTUALLY referenced that. I am so witty for getting that obscure reference...etc."" This is such a hollow form of comedy. I think the South Park episode about the manatees says it all.To each their own I guess.",NA,"7 March 2008"
"400","Family guy is truly amazing it's humor style has changed since earlier seasons however unlike most shows which lose the shine it's just adapted and become even more entertaining! I'm sorry to hard core Simpsons fans but that show should of been cut after the tenth season it's horrifically blunt and seems to be aimed at three year old's family guy has a certain aura that points out all the things that's wrong with society and still manages to make you laugh even when you don't agree it's fantastic! I can't get enough of this show I hope it never ends ( unless it goes sour) it deserves a freaking Oscar or whatever it is series get!!!!!!!!","10","22 August 2010"
"401","I grew up with the Simpsons and in my view it is the best, but The Family Guy would be number 2. Only because of its short run, but it is a very funny show. And I have more of an urge to watch that show than the Simpsons. I mean we have all heard of Bart, Homer, Mo, and Mr. Burns. But Stewie, Brian, Peter, and Chris don't get the comedic justice that should be theirs. The cool thing about this show is that each character has a style of comedy that different people will love. I like the Simpsons, but Homer is the Kramer of that show. The comedy is also around the same area, but The Family Guy has different styles. Sometimes I'll like Stewie, then Brian, the Chris; I can never choose one. The show kicks butt and is good enough to buy and watch.
My style of comedy is more of a black comedy style. So I love this show because it is black comedy, at least 60 percent. That could be the reason that it didn't last long, but it makes a good show. The other 40 percent is wit, ordinary jokes, and funny situations as well as weird occurrences. A good thing to do is to watch this show, then the Simpsons, and choose. To say again I like the Simpsons and know why it lasts, but I love this show. I may never get bored of it.",NA,"14 August 2003"
"402","One thing I've noticed about the reviews of the people who hate Family Guy is the redundant and tired argument that it is a rip off of The Simpsons. While the main character set up within is the same, there are overwhelming variations. Family Guy has a smaller number of characters, and is not afraid to introduce new, fresh characters to provide variation. The Simpsons stuck with a large character base that they have used for many seasons. The constant moral preaching of The Simpsons is not present in Family Guy. In fact, Family Guy have taken the warped, Americanized idea of morality and moral preaching (which is vague beyond belief), and used it to spin together some clever satirical sequences. There are numerous differences I could run over, but I only have 1000 words to work with, so I won't waste any more time pointing out what should be clear to people already. The voice work is pretty good, though if you searched really hard for a weakness, the voice work would have to take the cake. Fundamental characters who are voiced by a specialist are high standard, but Seth MacFarlane's vocal linguistics are not always on the money. A lot of voices echo Brian in a way, and Brian's voice is based mainly on Seth MacFarlane's actual voice. Despite this, I find the commonly used voice work within the family intelligent and witty, as it slots in well with each character. At the end of the day, a tiny flaw in the voice work drag Family Guy down. The episodes follow a formula, though because the writers Family Guy have established this formula, it's not boring or dated). The episodes deal with simple story lines which integrate flashbacks and both modern and retrospective pop culture references. What you get is a show that doesn't tread on irrelevant ground, but walks on irrelevant water. It's sharp switch of focus may be off putting for some, but at the end of the day, you can't complain about the structure when Family Guy delivers the amount of jokes it does. There are a huge number of memorable quotes (to list them all would probably take hours), which would get a laugh from most open - minded, thoughtful people. The fact that people have the audacity to assume that this show is aimed directly at immature school boys makes me wonder what's happened to people in this day and age. The last sentence of the above paragraph leads me to my final point; the people who rubbish Family Guy manage to drown themselves in recessive ridiculous rhetoric. Yes, I did use alliteration. Where you able to spot that? If you were, then you should be able to detect the irony, satire, wit, and playful sarcasm of Family Guy. I've only listed a number of techniques Family Guy uses, but seriously, how can you not spot irony in Family Guy? You only need to look at the theme song which claims we need to be remember ""good old fashioned values"". Family Guy couldn't get any worse at reminding us about values, making the theme song ironic. Don't claim that Family Guy allegedly doesn't contain irony, satire, etc. when you cannot spot it yourself. If you have had the pleasure of viewing ""Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story"", they even slip into deliberate self parody and point out the irony for the audience:Fireman #1: The fire was due to these stress relief candles. Fireman #2: Irony!If you can't grasp comic concepts, go watch excrement like The War At Home. I'm sure that won't be too intelligent for you. Also, watch the grammar (not so much spelling, I know typos happen), if you're posting about how stupid Family Guy supposedly is. There is nothing more satisfying for me than to watch skeptics make glaring contradictions. Clean up your arguments.That's about all from me, submit any questions or hateful incoherent comments like ""I ws so ryt lol"" to my Private Message Inbox.","9","19 May 2007"
"403","FG is fantastic I've got every season on DVD and they just keep getting funnier, generally its the same type of set-up as the simpsons full of strange and ridiculous characters, parodies and dovetailing,(two stories meet). The humour is very well done and extremely broad it encompasses parodies which only a select group would understand,un-political correctness for older audience, clever jokes which would go over the the head of those ""less educated"" members of society, weird sketch with just make u think ""What the hell?"" and of course raw comic slapstick. all in all family guy is a great show and this is proved by the fact that the network brought it it back after cancelling it, not many show can claim that!","9","31 August 2007"

THIS SHOW MUST BE DESTROYED.",NA,"14 June 1999"
"405","There are episodes of this show that are truly hilarious. This is true often enough to make this show very entertaining. The comedy tends to be very very blue, but in general, the show is so bizarre that it's difficult to get too offended by most of it. Story lines that involve Brian and Stewie are really the most interesting characters on the show. Because these two characters are the smarter characters on the show, and because they're very existence forces the viewer to suspend disbelief, they tend to end up with the strangest and most humorous plots and subplots, as well as the smarter jokes. However, there are times where it is less than inspired, and times where the jokes really are just offensive. . I think some racial and religion jokes can be very funny, and are often funny as presented on the show, but they are overused and therefore get very old very fast. Just a heads up: Anne Frank jokes are not funnyThe other characters are good sometimes, and at times aren't very interesting. Peter being stupid and bigoted can be very funny, but is a little overdone. It is very difficult to believe that Lois would actually stay with him, regardless of her implied moral ambiguity. The way he treats Meg has it's moments of twisted humor, but is often uncomfortable to watch. Is it really that funny to watch someone be verbally and at times physically abused by her family and her peers to the point where she becomes mentally ill? Meg's character is a giant question mark, because she's really not very sympathetic, which I'm sure is intentional, but she's not very well written. At some point, Meg's semi-psychotic behavior and her social isolation needs to give way to some other character traits Chris? Well, Chris's character is secondary at most. Even plots that center around something going on in Chris's life tend to be more about Peter's reaction to them than Chris. Perhaps it's better this way.This show is inconsistently very funny. It is funny often enough to make it worth recommending, but there are certainly episodes worth skipping.","7","30 September 2009"
"406","The summary line probably sums how I feel about this show in a nutshell. Having said that,that actually can be both a mark against AND a mark for it.The plots of each episode are almost completely irrelevant. Mostly,each episode is a very well-threaded series of pop-culture references and gags to inflate the stories involving the Griffith family of Quahog(spelling?),Rhode Island(?):patriarch Peter,a very corpulent man who loves to watch television and drink beer with his buddies,Joe(a wheelchair-bound former cop),Glen(a joyfully perverted loser)and Cleveland,Peter's apparent lone black friend. His wife Lois is seemingly domestic and average but actually comes from wealth and hides a fairly(Ahem)active past. Daughter Meg is a loserish awkward teen who still manages to get on with life despite it all. Son Chris is almost functionally retarded. Infant son Stewie has the voice and mind of an evil genius(think equal parts Vincent Price character,Dr.No and Simon Bar-Sinister from ""Underdog""). And last but not least,the family dog Brian is an articulate,thoughtful,upright walking man's best friend that puts up with the family.The trick to liking this show,in my estimation is that one not try to weigh in on each joke or plot device,and just let the pictures and events roll. Chances are,you'll find something that will make you laugh in varying degrees and frequency. Trivia: this show has the distinction of being somewhat of a ""Rasputin""(i.e. show that can't seem to be killed) since the FOX network actually had this show canceled THREE TIMES between 1999 and 2002 before they relented(due to heavy pressure from fans,of course,aided by Cartoon Network reruns,of course)and re-slotted the show on the continuous run it's been on since 2003. Anyone who enjoys a good hearty round of t.v. and movie referencing punctuating loose and (mostly)good-natured plots I feel won't be disappointed by this show.",NA,"12 September 2006"
"407","I have to say, this is by far my favorite show on television.Every Sunday night at 9:30 (We dvr it to fast forward through the commercials) my Dad and I (I'm 17) gather to watch our favorite show, Family Guy. Its never disappointing, we are always laughing our butts off through the entire show. The side clips are original and even though many of the story lines aren't, Peter's antics make them hilarious. I especially like the episodes with just Stewie and Brian because their personalities are so different. They interact in a way that none of the other characters do. To address many recent reviews about the original episodes (before it got canceled and brought back) that say they are better then the new ones I must say I completely disagree. I have watched most of the episodes since 2000 (I was never allowed to watch it until I was 14 but I dvr'd them on Cartoon Network) and I find them to be overly raunchy and frankly not funny. Stewie hadn't developed into the Stewie we know and love and Brian had very few roles in the episodes. It was mostly Peter doing stupid things that weren't very funny. For example, one episode he pretended to be the Fonz at a high school where Chris went. He tried to act stupid but all he really did was walk around like a cool kid. I've seen some of the Fonz antics and Peter basically did these as himself. In the new episodes Peter does completely random and original things such as adopting 30 puppies because he thinks he's dreaming. The puppies begin to do some inappropriate things to him but it remains hilarious, one day to cheer Chris up he got him a bull frog and poked a bunch of holes in it's back to let it breath. When he opened the box he saw that instead of allowing the frog to breath he had stabbed it to death. His reaction was hilarious. I will say the best episodes were from 2005-2009 but it still remains hilarious to me. There is a reason it remains the highest rated show on Animation Domination you know.","10","21 March 2012"
"408","Humor Wins Television shows get cancelled all the time, but is it possible for a television show to get cancelled and come back to life even better than it was the first time? ""No way!"" you may think, but it happened with the hit T.V. series Family Guy. Family Guy is a great T.V. show because its use of comedy is one of a kind. Not everybody is going to like the show, but if you are a fan you will find its political incorrectness very funny.Fox, who is known for its early T.V. show cancellations, cut Family Guy in 2002 after three seasons. There ended up being such a high demand for the DVD series that Fox decided to put Family Guy back on the air, returning to television in May 2005 with its fourth season. There is no question that the fourth season is as funny if not funnier than the seasons before it.The show is set in the fake town of Quahog, Rhode Island and is centered around the very dysfunctional Griffin Family. Peter, the father figure, is the head of the household. Sometimes driven wild by her own crazy family, Lois, the mother, is the peace maker. Chris, the son, is not only slow physically but also mentally. Meg is the mistreated daughter who doesn't have many friends. Stewie, the baby of the family, can talk but I don't believe anyone in the family can actually hear him. Occasionally consuming alcoholic beverages, Brian the family's talking dog, rounds out the cast. Even more unique than the characters themselves is the style in which Family Guy is written. It's comprised of a sort of sarcastic fast paced dry humor that requires the viewer to not only be aware of what's happening on the show, but also what's happening in the real world. Although the overall story may not always be funny, the jokes and situations are witty, clever, and undoubtedly entertaining. It's amazing how the writers can come up with crazy ideas and implement them into this irregular family's life. There are many pop culture references in Family Guy, and a lot of ""That was like the time<U+0085>"" flashback moments. You can never tell what is going to happen next. If you think you have a hunch, most of the time you will end up undoubtedly wrong. In one episode Lois and Brian have to go find Peter out in the woods. Brian says ""Don't worry Lois I was the one who found George Bush after Hurricane Katrina."" The next scene has Brian walking up to a tree house and yelling ""Mr. President, are you up there?"" Next it shows George Bush poking his head out of the tree house, and he says ""Go away"" Brian then says ""Sir there is a disaster in New Orleans that you have to deal with."" Finally George Bush says ""Don't make me do stuff."" This is a perfect example of the shows political incorrectness, and it's off the wall comedy. Obviously the writers of Family Guy are not in favor of the President and disagreed with the way he handled Hurricane Katrina. By using scenes from earlier episodes during flashbacks, viewers tend to watch the show more regularly so as not to miss out or be overcome with confusion. One of the recurring gags in Family Guy is when they take a quick joke and overdo it almost to the point of being awkward, but in doing so it actually makes it even funnier. In the episode Patriot Games, Peter gets invited to play with the New England Patriots. After he scores a touchdown, he celebrates by singing a song called ""Shipoopi"". As he is singing and dancing to this song the entire crowd sings along. While the cheerleaders, referees, and Peter's teammates are the back up dancers. This goes on for a long time, and finally at the end of the celebration Peter says to himself, ""I made a touchdown"". That would never happen in a real professional football game, but in Family Guy, anything goes.Overall I think this is a great show for young and old adults. There is something in Family Guy for everybody. Its hilarious and unpredictable humor makes it an enjoyable show to watch. When the fourth season came out on DVD, Star Magazine said the show was ""As rude and funny as it ever was!"" I simply can't agree more with their blurb. As for myself, I think Family Guy is one of the funniest and most entertaining shows ever made.","10","26 February 2007"
"409","OK I'm a huge fan of the first 5 seasons, but after that I cringe with absolute disgust. Seth was going pretty good until he got lazy and pathetic with so called reality he so humbly describes his satire/ real life work. You might find one good joke every 4 episodes, but it's a lot less then what Seth could poo out every episode. The only good quality left is Stewie, he is the only character left that I might chuckle at, everyone else (yes including Peter) is an absolute embarrassment to the senses. I'm sorry if Seth chooses gross out gags over smart satirical gags to appease to the huddle masses of Generation Y. Yes I gave it a 8/10 that's how good the first 5 seasons were, the rest is just pig vomit that a once funny guy now finds acceptable.","8","2 June 2013"
"410","Let's not deny it, Family Guy was once a huge hit. I would watch every episode and buy all the box sets, but recently it's been lagging in both storyline and character development, and not to mention the fun factor.The story is about the Griffin family, Peter is the overweight, drunk and retarded dad who gets into all kinds of crazy get ups, like his hilarious plastic surgery addiction, and getting America jumping into song and dance in the infamous Shipoopi number. He is married to the extremely attractive and feisty redhead Lois, who comes from a very wealthy family. She is a loving mother, but is also a dynamite in the bedroom. They have three children, socially rejected and unattractive Meg, Chris, the preteen Peter, and violently evil baby Stewie, who craves world domination and conducts bizarre schemes to kill his mother. And last is Brian, their talking pet dog, who drinks, smokes and does drugs, whilst maintaining unsuccessful relationships with various women and tries fruitlessly to complete his novel.Sounds pretty good, right? Dubbed by many as the 'adult Simpsons' and I happily agreed. But the arrival of season six brought the well known 'Stewie Kills Lois/Lois Kills Stewie' two part episode which saw the downfall of the once great evil Stewie. That annoyed me, but I still enjoyed the series, but after another season I became bored with it. What started as a great, hilarious cartoon about a dysfunctional family suddenly turned into a violent South Park remake, complete with swearing and gore.I still like some of the episodes such as 'I Dream Of Jesus' and 'Road To The North Pole', but the characters have viciously transformed way too much. Peter is now less comic drunk and more violent drunk, where he beats everyone up and swears until he turns blue. Lois is now, well, insane. Still full of the sex jokes and raging libido, but it's become rather tasteless and annoying. Meg is also violent and tries to become the boss of the family with gross outcomes, but is always shoved back down the social ladder, where she continues to cut herself and throw up. I preferred her as the sweet girl who gets on with her family, despite all the crap she gets. Chris is still the preteen Peter, and I just don't like it. Stewie, like I said, has shed his evil persona and become a normal baby, besides all the high tech gadgets he possesses, although he occasionally finds himself aiming a gun at Lois. Now Brian? I never liked him much, but now I loath him. He drives me nuts with his selfish personality and urge to legalise drugs, whilst every so often tries to rape Lois, who he has a deep unrequited love for. Oh, and he falls in love every other episode, but it never works out.Yes, it sounds like I hate Family Guy now, but I don't. It still produces some funny episodes and memorable themes, but all in all, I don't like the characters or the over use of blood and swearing. The new HD isn't doing it for me either, I preferred the previous animations.Some will love it, some will hate it, it all depends on what you like. I still watch the episodes in hope that it will restore the greatness it once had, but for now? Fail.",NA,"31 August 2011"
"411","In January of 1999, we were introduced to the Griffins. A rural Irish family just trying to make it from day to day. I fell in love with their first show, and watched the series all the time. The humor was on time. The pop culture references were dead on, and the cut away jokes were smart and used in the best way. The stories had some emotion to it too. The characters would come to some realization, and it would make them have a greater understanding, or would bring some of the family members closer together. The characters were lovable. First you had Peter Griffin, the lovable but stupid father who just wanted the best for his family. His wife Lois tries to hold the family together whenever Peter has another hair brained scheme. Then you have their three children. The oldest daughter is Meg, a social outcast at school who just wants to be accepted by the cool kids. Chris is their middle son who is kind of slow, and is only interested in drawing. Their youngest son Stewie wishes to rule the world someday, and wants to see death come to his own mother Louis. Then there is the family dog Brian, a sophisticated talking dog who does his best to guide Peter through his life.The show was canceled after a couple of seasons, and naturally fans were upset. It finally would make it's way back on to television. However it was never the same, and it hasn't gotten better as the series has progressed. It no longer seems to be about the stories anymore. There is no positive emotion to it. In fact, the show has gotten cruel over the years. Most of the jokes they do now are just flat out mean. There is a fine line between being funny and then being cruel, and they cross it a lot. They use cut away jokes way too often now as well to the point it has gotten old and repetitive. They also seam to work too hard to set up a joke as well, and by the time the joke happens, it is not funny because you are expecting it. The character development has a taken an odd turn as well. Stewie seems to have given up on his quest for world domination, and instead spends his time hat shopping. Though not as often, Stewie still tries to kill Louis from time to time. Peter is no longer a lovable idiot anymore. Now most of the stuff he does is just annoying. It seems that MacFarlane having to work on three shows at the same time has put a strain on the series. Family Guy is still a popular show on T.V., and will probably stay there for quite some time. Will it be around as long as The Simpsons, I don't know. It might not since Seth MacFarlane is busy creating other shows, and he may get tired of Family Guy. However, if you are someone who has never seen the show, I recommended seeing it from 1999 and early 2000's","7","26 August 2010"
"412","I used to love Family Guy. I loved the fact that Seth MacFarlane pulled no punches. No one, and no topic, was off limits. Seth wasn't afraid to make fun of every religion, every ethnicity, every stereotype, ever political view and every social topic. But....that is no longer the case. Seth is now a cancel culture loving coward afraid to hurt anyone's little feelings or say something that might cause the Twitter mobs to get outraged. Today's Family Guy is watered down , unfunny shell of what it used to be.","5","11 February 2022"
"413","I just love it! It's a great cartoon, that I hope sticks around for a long time. It's comical and witty, and goofy, like if Airplane or Naked Gun was animated. Most people might think it's just plain stupid, but there is a lot of wit to it, and a lot of jokes that can be missed, references to commercials and takes on TV and movies (Like the Critic, which I miss a lot) One example was when Peter was in the bank with robbers, the run goes off, and they cut to this kid, exclaiming that he just bought a JFK pez dispenser, which naturally gets shot. Another was when the German sausage vender, who looks like Hitler, takes control over the Polish both, then glances over at the Chechz's booth, and even the Mento's (Minto's parody they did as well). there is a lot of things, that is as crazy as Simpsons, and a lot of parodies to movies, and al ot of quick one liners, such as ""I'm sorry Timmy, you need 15 tickets to live"" It's also the side stories or flashbacks, that happen when a character makes reference to some event. I find this show funny and clever, and do wish it would stick around, showing that Fox is just as outrageous as ever. :)I think this, with Simpson's, Sunday's 8 o'clock hour is one hilarious stitch after another.

"414","It's just not the show it was ten years ago. Personally, I think Seth MacFarlane has too much on his plate with this show, ""American Dad"", and ""The Cleveland Show"".The most annoying thing is how painfully repetitive the story lines are and those that aren't, aren't even funny. James Woods, the chicken fights, Spies Like Us, etc were not funny at all.MacFarlane and staff seem to follow the same plot points every episode and it's unbearable to watch anymore.Peter, Joe, and Quaqmire scheme something. Check. Brian and Stewie scheme something. Check. Random references to a movie or some click from the 70's or 80's. Check. Meg relays how pathetic she is. Check.I think MacFarlane tried too hard to over take ""The Simpsons"" but his show was never as good. I love ""The Simpsons"" and I'll be the first to admit that the last ten seasons aren't even close to being as good as the first ten. However at least Matt Groening puts out something different with each episode.","6","15 August 2010"

This show has seen me through my worst times made me laugh even when I didn't think I could. Seth please never listen to these snobby critics and easily offended people with no sense of humor.

Then I happened to watch the episode where the family heads down South. I could not stop laughing. I was not only laughing but in tears. No SIMPSONS episode, no SEINFELD episode, no ODD COUPLE episode, no MASH episode was ever this side-splittingly funny. I then saw the episode where Peter installs a fully stocked bar in his basement, and Lois becomes a sexy chanteuse. Simply amazing. I now watch the show every chance I get. And you should too.

"420","Well, after seeing more and more of these newer episodes, I just have to say that they feel energetic and more clever. The reviewers that are saying Family Guy sucks now are just probably looking for something good to dis. Family Guy did not plummet after Season 4, or even Season 8 for that matter. These newer episodes have so far had good plots, with a few good sight gags. They have definitely improved themselves, because they want these negative reviewers to stop talking bad about this show and see it for what it really is, clever gags and hilarious comedy, I mean yes they do have an excessive amount of musical numbers which everyone loathes. But, this time they've cut back on them this time. Anyway, these last three or four episodes have done much better than any other episode. Soon Family Guy will get the movie treatment, and that'll be fun to watch. With the amount of improvement they've made since the negative reviewers dissed them too much, I'm glad. And if these people keep dissing them I don't know what they'll pull. Face it you negative review writing jerks, Family Guy won't end, not this time (at least until Seth MacFarlene dies).

You may laugh ten times harder with this show. Seth MacFarlane is a talented genius, when he created this show.

(Fortunately, I'm a lifelong Yancophile.)Not much story in each episode, just lots of jokes - but good ones, however. And it's interesting that unlike Homer Simpson, Peter's genes have been noticeably passed onto his children (both Chris and Meg are decidedly plump). That's the only way it is superior to we-all-know-what, though - it's not as layered or as rewarding. All it is, is very very funny... but is that so bad?

Family was by far the most hillariously intelligent comedy ever. It's a fusion of  smart dirty jokes and intelligence. I mean when was the last time we've seen a dog pose as a human, and baby threaten to kill his parents with his high intelligence. We'll I don't know, Maybe I made it up or I had dream about, but What I'm saying is, That Family Guy was by all means the best thing since ""In Living Color"" and ""Married with Children"" (Which BTW I worship to this day) that was put on FOX. The Simpsons were great and were the show of the 90's (Especially from 92-99) but after a while, Matt Groening and his crew of writers began running out of Ideas.YKW I'm thinkin'. If they won't ever bring back family guy then why dont they re-tool the simpsons and turn it into a more ""Family Guyesque"" style.

Really?Apparently the audience is so unintelligent that the jokes have to be explained for them. Wow. ""That means two things""People didn't like Vinny, even if he had potential as a new character. Immature, even telling Vinny to die, really shows how the fans of Family Guy are like.The only thing I actually stick around for are the racist jokes. Those are actually funny, and even then, some of them are not funny.If I don't like it, don't watch it? It's called the right to an opinion.

"435","Family Guy would have to be my favourite T.V Series for the reasons below I am about to display.It is outrageously funny but I may warn you the humour Family Guy displays is very crude. If you are in the mood for a laugh or got nothing to do I would definitely suggest it.Each episode of Family Guy is different. As they go on different adventures or need to solve another problem one of the family member is having.My favourite character is Stewie. A baby who is as smart as a grown male. His best friend in the family is the dog called Brian. They will often set out on crazy and strange adventures that have a twisted yet awesome ending. Stewie is a very unique child because he has attempted to kill his mother (Lois) in many different episodes.The reason I gave Family Guy a 9/10 and I know this may sound harsh but some of the things that the characters say can be taken as offensive or racist and another reason is because of an episode entitled ""Life of Brian"" but I won't go into to much detail with that.Seth McFarland (the creator of Family Guy) has made an outrageously funny and creative show that is a big credit to him. Family Guy is my favourite show and I would definitely suggest it to people.","9","20 January 2015"
"436","My review is way too late and is mostly to get something off my soul.I like Family Guys animation and also the design. It is much more crude and ... in a way ... mature (or rather addressing a more mature audience) than Simpsons.But what ruins it for me is the utmost mean spirited way the characters are. And i do not mean that a purely ""bad"" character is a bad thing. Especially the character of Peper Griffin switches from prinicpled and caring to reckless and downright moronic - a little too much. In Simpsons ... there usually way a reason for Homers behaviour... in Family Guy - there is not.In Family Guy - i realized that i was watching an animated version of the Kardashians after a while... or rather - a show about a bunch of utmost idiotic people - that never learn a thing and do not develop.And whats the fun of that ...To be fair - some scenes and jokes hit the mark and the show does know how to be funny - but the infuriating setup of it all ruined it for me.So all in all ... it is just average. Nothing i could stand to watch more than like 2 episodes in a row.","5","19 October 2016"
"437","Family guy is totally hilarious, has amazing voice actors and actresses and just always seems to have 10 star rating episodes!!! Nothing gets better than family guy!! I absolutely love Stewie and Bryan I believe they make the show exactly how it is along with Peter, to me these three are the funniest, most interesting and appealing characters along with Quagmire. I love when they do the road trip episodes with Stewie and who ever but I want them to do more along with more time traveling episodes with Stewie because they are always fantastic. I hope Family can continue with its success and begin to use our current reality and real life story lines on the show as its own story lines and plots but they are still always unique and creative, artistic and exhilarating. I also hope family guy can last at least 24 seasons even though their only going into their 14th. I absolutely love family guy!!!","10","14 August 2015"
"438","Why did they have to cancel this show?  This was like The Simpsons with attitude!  I loved this show!  It was like a South Park that was suitable for broadcast TV.  It pushed the limits, but not to the point of protest. It was flat out funny, if stupid.  I laughed so hard when a teenage Peter in a flashback asked his teacher why the dinosaurs went extinct, only to hear his teacher say, ""Because you touch yourself at night.""Fox seriously needs to toss out its Married by Joe Millionaire at Celebrity Boot Camp garbage and bring back Family Guy!","10","13 March 2003"
"439","These shows will always be compared to The Simpsons, since that was the first really good animated satire made for television. Some really good ones, like South Park and Futurama has come along since then, but The Simpsons is still the original. The creators of these shows know this, so the shows that pop up have different ways of attacking society. Futurama, for instance, does it from a futuristic point of view, and South Park is almost a bit political at times, but they are both GREAT shows.I haven's missed an episode of Family Guy, and I just love the show. It's just really brilliant, and Stewie is one of the funniest and most evil characters I've seen in years. All character (except maybe Meg) are brilliant, and I love them all. This shows angle on society is television, and it does a really good job at ridiculing it. No show is left untouched, and they have just started.One BIG part of Family Guy is the flashbacks. They are absolutely incredible. My favorite is ""I remember the last time I accepted a coupon from a man in a chicken suit"". They are so insane and wonderful that you just want to keep them in your pocket and take them out on special events to show your friends (the flashbacks).Well, just enjoy the show, I know I will. Yeay Seth MacFarlane!!""Must kill Abraham Lincoln...""",NA,"31 October 2001"
"440","SPOILERSI know, Family Guy is a rip off of the Simpsons. Peter is just like Homer. Lois is just like Marge. But, Chris is not like Bart at all. Meg is not like Lisa at all. Brian is not like Santa's Little Helper at all. Stewie is not like Maggie at all. Also, Family Guy's humor is not like the Simpsons at all. The Simpsons is just like a real family. It has some things that would never happen, but overall it's a very realistic cartoon. Family Guy, on the other hand, has silly humor that it could happen, but it would be very odd if it did happen. Family Guy also consists of flash-backs or recurring gags, like the Evil Monkey that lives in Chris's bedroom. But mostly, it's just Peter's wacky flash-backs.Family Guy has a story just like the Simpsons. A regular, suburban family are in wacky, silly situations. The thing is, Family Guy's situations are much wackier, and unrealistic. For example, a family could go on a reality show, in an episode of the Simpsons. Family Guy, on the other hand, consists of a talking dog and talking baby going to Europe. See, Family Guy is not really realistic. Although it unrealistic, it's a good show throughout, with all the movie parodies and wacky plots.Overall, this is a great show, although it can never be as good as the Simpsons. I also find Family Guy's humor very original, which I liked. Also, some things can be pretty offensive.8/10 Recommend Titles: The Simpsons, South Park","8","6 November 2006"
"441","at least I hope it doesn't. I liked the first episode okay but the last couple episodes... The dog and baby are the best things about it and they're both ripped from other cartoons.

"442","Smart, near to the knuckle, but usually very funny show that won me over with the abundance of clever 'in' jokes, usually through the use of 'flashback' scenes.Best episodes are in the 3rd series, especially my favourite where they end up in the deep south and mercilessly parody life in those parts.Well observed characters, with excellent voices (esp Stewie's evil Rex Harrison voice) make this well worth watching. Plenty of interesting 'guest' voices pop up also.However if you are easily offended Family Guy is best avoided,they're not shy of pushing the limits of good taste.",NA,"28 May 2004"
"443","Family guy in its hay day was a decent watch. Sure the plots were thin, but there was definitely a lot of heart put in to the characters and jokes. This results in one of the best shows to watch in a group
However when we fast forward, modern family is easily in my top 10 worst shows of all time. This show rotted very fast and went from good to downright abysmal. The jokes for the most part are unbearable and usually are done for filler. The plots aren't just thin but desperate for shock, like Stevie and brian having puppies and Peter marrying Chris
If you're planning on watching this show watch seasons 1-9. Seasons 6-9 aren't the best and still have bad episodes but they are still watchable","6","28 May 2019"
"444","Pros: Stewie-Best T.V. baby I've ever seen. When I watch the reruns of the first few seasons, I look forward to another moment of Stewie.Early series-I admit, this show wouldn't get less than seven stars from me if the quality of the original show was kept up.Open-ended universe-ANYTHING can happen in the Family Guy universe. It's fun to think of all the pure outrageousness around.Brian as a talking dog-If dogs could talk in dog situations, like being chased by the vacuum or car-rides, I think McFarlane and the boys have captured in perfectly.Occasional Moments- One out of every ten of the cut away jokes are actually funny.Cons: Peter, Lois, Chris, and Meg-Except for the obvious differences in appearance and minor tweaks in personality, these characters are VERY similar to the Simpsons. A stupid, oafish, over-weight dad, a usual moral mom with an annoying, naggy voice, a dumb, trouble-making son, and an often sad, unpopular daughter.Brian as a person-Annoying, usual unfunny, and often ruining the greatest character on the show.Stewie/Brian Tag Team Episodes-Cheesy, crappy episodes. In my opinion, they should put Peter and Stewie together more often.The Evil Monkey-It gets real old, real fast. Like the first time you see it.The Fighting Chicken-It gets real old, real fast. Like the first time you see it.Use of Dead Celebrities-I mean dead figuratively. Half of the time, the stars they use in their cut aways are people I have never heard of.Pointlessness-This is why many people find this show annoying. Nine out of ten times, the jokes come out of NOWHERE!!! One such joke was when they showed a married caveman couple arguing. For five minutes of my life that I'll never get back, I felt confused and annoyed. For a better idea of what I really think of Family Guy, refer to the South Park episodes ""Cartoon Wars"" parts one and two.","10","8 January 2008"
"445","Family Guy changed my life forever. It's the absolutely most hilarious show of all freaking time. I don't know why the heak people voted American Dad a better show. That was garbage (read my review). Just a few days ago, I became addicted to Family Guy. Go to www.familyguydirect.com, they have all the episodes. The jokes in this show is unexplainable. It's just too hilariously funny. Peter pushes meg's face in his butt and farts, Peter lit Meg's head on fire, Quagmire does stereotypical Japanese things before having sex with a Japanese woman but the griffin Family watches the whole thing, Peter's hilarious mental Retard""ness"" is something you will die from because of laughter. Peter is the dad in the griffin family, he is the funniest in the family, Lois is a house wife and teaches piano, Brian is the family dog who is anthropomorphic, Stewie is the baby who is somehow evil and extremely intelligent, Chris is Peter's son and in many ways like his father, and Meg is the daughter who doesn't fit in school and is constantly ignored and made fun of in the family.The quality of Family Guy is 100,000 times better than any Family Guy spin off. But there has been problems with the show and the quality has been downgraded since Season 5, but still, it's Family Guy.In conclusion, Family Guy is my Favorite show. It's humor should be awarded by many but some just think a CIA agent who is Sex-Crazed is funnier. But NO, NO that is NOT funny... thank you.10/10 but even a score like that is too low for a show like this.","10","20 February 2012"
"446","What can I say about Family Guy, its spontaneous, its smart, its sarcastic, and its friggin' hilarious! To some known as the next genereation of the Simpsons, Family Guy has kept viewers in stitches since the pilot on Fox in 1999. Now with re-runs on Cartoon Network, Family guy is as popular as it was before.But for all of you Peter, Lowis, Chris, Meg, and Stuie fans who can't see it on Cartoon Network, never fear, Family Guy returns to Fox this Autum (or so I've heard). So in conclusion, I love this show, And I'll keep watching as long as its on the airwaves. Good Day, God Bless, and Watch Out!",NA,"26 June 2004"
"447","If you thought that the Simpson were dysfunctional. As they were the first dysfunctional family in the cartoon sense. But they are cakewalks compared to this family.As Stewie is the one that causes all the destruction. He may be a baby. But he is British and he is smart. Plus he has such a sharp tongue along the way.Brian the dog is the perfect straight man to Stewie's antics. While Peter Griffith is a bumbling blue collar worker. As his wife Lois is the perfect straight man or woman, for him as she is from a wealthy family.There is teenage daughter Meg who is awkward but pretty bright and Chris in addition to Stewie, the younger version of Peter. Not too bright and a slacker.Still though Seth McFarland who provided the voices and is the executive producer and creator of the show, took the Simpsons to a whole new level.","6","18 May 2013"
"448","For those unfamiliar with Family Guy, this was an animated series that for a while, aired on Fox before being yanked. It has since made a successful comeback (and its second series premiere did so with a nice slap in the face to Fox executives by listing all of the short-lived b-grade and c-grade series that would come and go before Family Guy was permitted another shot). And it was quite different from previous Fox animated fare (i.e. The Simpsons and King of the Hill) because of it's characters and purpose. The Griffith family, at the center of this series, is comprised of the typical sitcom-esquire idiot (and nowadays, crude and insensitive) father figure, Peter; his stereotypically (sometimes) level-headed wife, Lois; the clueless teen daughter, Meg; their half-retarded son, Chris (see the Sept. 2005 spoof on Family Guy); their insolent British-accented toddler, Stewie (probably one of the funniest characters on the show); and their hinted-to-be-gay talking dog, Brian. (These characters are basically repeated for ""American Dad"").I've never been a tremendous fan of ""Family Guy"" because its humor is based purely on trying to outdo its own outrageousness (and in even more of an offensive and outrageous manner with the on-again/off-again series ""American Dad""). True, there are some awesomely off-beat moments which are just so weird, you can't help but to laugh (particularly from many of Stewie and Brian's strange adventures).And where have we seen this before? With South Park, which Family Guy creators are either trying to make a comparable model of (and you still have limits since it is aired on network television---but of course, there are always the DVD collections). Either that, or they are trying to top what South Park has managed to (and continues to) successfully do (and again, Family Guy has to adhere to certain limits that Comedy Central programming does not). But, with South Park, it wasn't always simply outrageousness for the sake of being vile or disgusting or offensive or whatever, but rather, it is comic material ancillary to often wildly excellent satire. Something which Family Guy radically lacks and, is therefore, repetitive and tiresome in it's attempts to be outrageous for the sake of outrageousness. After a while, you can only get so extreme and then the humor is just dead. (Even some of the antics of South Park are no longer shocking enough to be funny anymore).",NA,"7 September 2005"
"449","Let's face it. Whether you like it or not, Family Guy was once a good show. The cutaways were funny, the plots were funny, and the overall show was just..funny. But then it wasn't, as the show decreased in humor and focused on ratings trap episodes and just bland and boring plots. It fell from grace, but let's all remember how it was once good. Once.","6","24 April 2018"
"450","i have 1 word....  FAMILY GUY IS THA BEST! with jokes as: well if my son, cant come in your club, i will go bymyself, see ya later chris! i mean thats comedy. and i think its better than simpsons and futurerama as well. i mean a family with a dog that speaks, and everyone understands him. and a baby that speaks, no one understands him exept the dog, and they have some big conversations, because they are also the smartest of the whole family. aint that comedy or WHAT?!?!",NA,"9 January 2003"
"451","OK...I know this has been said a million times, but to add insult to injury...the show has gotten really stale lately. Particularly, I wanted to point out, that at first it was about a man trying to find a job to support his dysfunctional family, or impress them, or be a decent person around them. Something like that, it was about the family and how the man would deal with an issue involving said family. Lately though, and by lately, I don't literally mean lately, more or less after the 3rd or 4th season, Peter's lost his character traits entirely and become more or less a doll that spews retarded jokes. It still tries to make reference to it's past episodes and events that have occurred, but you don't even care, because his character isn't even a character anymore. Stewie's become gay, which would be perfectly fine if they didn't make him hit on EVERY SINGLE guy in the show. Also, because he's gay he had to be a trannie? What? Him being a trannie wasn't funny the first time I saw it, why drag it on, not just for the one episode, but onto LATER episodes. Hell, South Park delved in Cartman being gay, but they didn't make it his ENTIRE character. He still is the crazy guy who does very creepy things, though still very childish.The show also always complains that Meg isn't an interesting character. Well, when you don't write her to be interesting, she won't. It's pretty logical that if you don't involve a character in the show, you might as well kill her off. Of course they can't do that, and have killed off other unimportant characters, the point remains, they could get rid of Meg somehow, but no, they want the stupid one-line jokes that involve her getting hurt, whether hurt feelings or actually physically hurt.There's also what I call ""filler"" moments, when the crew can't write anything interesting enough to fill a whole episode and just have something else take over, or drag out something where animation is so simplistic that everything stays in one place and only a mouth moves. For those who know, they can just draw a simple figure of the character, and put the mouth even more in the foreground, it's lazily done. ""MOM MOM MOM"" OK...Filler moment. The random flashbacks, I honestly can't complain about. It was part of the show when I liked the show, and it should remain part of the show...it's when they turn into filler moments that I really hate. ""Mr. Conway Twitty, let's hear a whole song from you now to divert the attention from the fact that Seth and the other writers couldn't come up with the 5-10 minutes of that song"" What's worse is, they just take a video of Conway Twitty, they don't even BOTHER animating a scene of it. No one laughs at it, I end up turning the channel if I don't get bored before that moment anyway. The only filler I've liked so far was short and to the point, with ""The Rock"" simulating Peter and Lois having sex. The actual episode beyond that wasn't all that funny...however...Beyond all the complaint, there must be something to draw me in, because I do keep watching it enough to know all this. Maybe it's hope...but maybe, just maybe, it does still have entertainment value to me.","4","26 January 2010"
"452","Family Guy <> Simpsons. Family Guy >= South Park. I been a fan of The Simpsons since day 1 just when I a kid and grew up on The Simpsons. I lived through Bartmania. When The Simpsons went popular in early '90's, all the other channels tried to jump on and failed miserably. Then in '95, a cult cartoon became a national phenom with South Park, and I also became an immediate fan. Lastly in '99, right after the Superbowl I became a fan of a new series called Family Guy. While the animation is nowhere as good as The Simpsons but not as crude as South Park, it is not comparable to The Simpsons. The dialogue & jokes seem to definitely be more South Park influenced than The Simpsons. At times, Family Guy pushes the envelope a lot more often than South Park (movie & series).The first season was tamed compared to the 2nd and now finally the 3rd season. Family Guy has become a cult hit even after it was pulled off the air in mid-2000. I tend to find Family Guy to be way more offensive with its jokes than South Park. Its unbelievable the amount of sexual innuendoes and no-hold barred dark humor on just about every subject possible to be offensive on has been poked at in this series and this is aired on a public channel. Cable can be a bit more lenient, but just watching this series on Fox I'm just utterly amazed what it gets away with. While it's tame on the cursing, the humor goes to the absolute absurd. One particular example is when the character Meg is talking to guy, and to keep his attention she blurts out, ""Well I can't taste salt."" While younger kids who watch this show won't some jokes, adults should be able to pick it up quickly and will just have you rolling on the floor laughing. Actual actors could never do the material on this show. That's what makes it brilliant since its not done by actual actors it allows the extremely creative writers to find things to poke at. This show it tailored for 18-34 male audience with frequent pop culture references from 70's-90's but seems also to have racy humor that I don't think women would find to be humorous.The last several years of The Simpsons have not been great and at times down right weird and South Park has been hit & miss with each particular episode in the last 2 seaons and they seem to be missing the original formula. This can not be said about Family Guy as it just keeps improving with each episode. If you like your humor very dark with no sugar or cream, this is a series you just can't miss.",NA,"9 August 2001"
"453","The reason that this show is so popular can be summed up in one sentence; People are dumb.This show is written by people who are racist, cheauvenist, and immature, but smart enough to realize how many men have low intellects, and how to aim this show right at them. It's psychologically similar to showing videos of bananas to chimps. You get a positive reaction.Now, I say this is aimed at men because I have yet to meet any woman who likes this show. They may tolerate it for their husbands' sake, maybe even crack a smile or two. Read the comments list....I found only one comment that was apparently written by a woman, and her attitude was not in favor of the show. It's like that other garbage called ""The Man Show,"" it's written for dumb men to enjoy.First off, the father is not someone who could function in everyday life without several medications and constant supervision (and I must note that I am very tired of any sitcom that dummies down all the men to babbling idiots, though I am sure that some exist, but leave them off the television.) Peter treats his wife like crap. He talks down to her, treats her like a slave, cares little or nothing about how she feels, or her opinions. He has views on women that were common in the 1930's. I've seen him beating her up, ordering her to fix him something to eat, telling her that she can't drive a car because it's illegal for women to drive. He watches Lifetime television, lovingly called ""Television for idiots."" The writers cleverly pointed out there that women were idiots. He is also racist, but it's OK, because he needs a Jew for only for financial gain. Oh boy, that's funny. Ha ha ha. Now I understand about his singing for ""those good old fashioned values."" Old fashioned as in decades ago.Lois is not any better. True, she has some intelligence, but not enough to leave the jerk. But she loves him for who he is. Ahhh, sigh. Get real. She's the dream girl for every dumb man in America; she cooks, cleans, puts out, and puts up with your stupid ass mistakes. The children don't hold any better, as the oldest boy is a clone of his father, and the daughter is self pre-occupied (ok, most teen girls are, I'll give you that). The baby is just a rip off of another big-headed character. I won't say who, but Stewie should have a twin that says ""Narf!"" The show is pure garbage. Unlike dysfunctional family shows like The Simpsons and Married with Children, this show lacks any real charm. It's aimed at the lowest common denominator amongst TV viewers, and has no redeeming values at all. Fox made a great move in canceling this show, but because idiots also have a voice, it's making a comeback. I'm half convinced that every guy that likes this show lives in a trailer park, but there aren't that many trailer parks in existence to warrant all of the votes received to bring back the show. That is a truly scary thought.Criticize my thoughts if you like. But if you really like this show, you probably didn't understand half of what I said, did you?",NA,"1 December 2004"
"454","Family Guy is a very divisive show. It divides people into groups that like and and might not be total idiots, and people who hate it and most assuredly are.In a time when almost every mainstream animated comedy has lost its way, either spiraling downward into clichéd irrelevancy like ""The Simpsons"" or destroying itself with wholesale arrogance and self indulgence like South Park, it is nice to see that SOMEONE understands that the purpose of a comedy is not to keep a long dead franchise going for merchandising rights, or to act as the creator's own private blog, but to be funny.Family guy is a show that is unafraid to take risks, to do new things, and change the formula between episodes almost every week, instead of just on Halloween or Xmas. In short it's what the simpsons was in is golden years, but less formulaic. It may not be quite as sharp, and it's highly British sense of humor may be lost on some, but it still remains one of the few oasis in the massive comedic dry spell that is animated television.","10","11 June 2006"
"455","Family Guy is what it is, dick-fart jokes at its purest. If you are into that type of thing, then you will love this show...however, it fails completely on every other level if you don't like that style of humor. The overall quality of the show is rather low in my opinion, both writing and direction. By which I mean, the show is just so easy to predict the punchlines and it is rarely even amusing. If me and my friends watch, we spend the time saying the punchline before the setup is even done or we figure out better punchlines. And then there is the whole style of cutting away from the story to go do some little side joke, thats an OK form of directing/writing...but its still weak.But yeah, you either like it for the humor or you hate it for the simple humor (and its anti-intellectual sense of pride)",NA,"27 January 2006"
"456","What can I say about this show? Of the 50 episodes that I have seen I have not really enjoyed two of them, the second Death episode and Peter's Father episode.

"458","For me, this is truly a very good show. I know some people get annoyed at the regular cutaways, myself included (some of them being simply unfunny, or sometimes its just the fact I don't have the contextual knowledge to understand the joke, I'm 15) , but in reality , most of them are very good. It is well animated and nice to watch, but the thing I love most about it is the diversity of the episodes. The Brian and Stewie episodes are absolutely excellent, for example the ""Road to"" episodes and other time travel episodes, not to mention other episodes like ""Three Kings"". These episodes are such fun to watch, especially when you're my age. The risky humour and ridiculous gags make me laugh out loud at times, something I don't usually do at the TV. Since I began watching a few years ago, I've bought 8 seasons, and just watch them whenever I'm not feeling so good. Seriously a great show, even if sometimes the cutaways are infuriating.","8","20 September 2012"

With this show they can have something that has nothing to do with what their talking about and just throw it in there and it'll be funny like throwing Vinny from My Cousin Vinny in the middle of that island with those foreigners.

"460","SPOILERS For the first time ever, 2004 was the year a television series was resurrected due to DVD sales. That programme was hilarious cartoon ""Family Guy"". Full of cult references and hilarious one liners, this series has thrived on a student cult following and is perhaps more popular now than ever before.Peter Griffin (voiced by creator Seth MacFarlane) is the father of the Griffin family. A loud, often offencive man, the only thing as big as Peter's stomach is his love for his family.Peter's wife Lois (voiced by Alex Borstein) is a passionate redhead with a rich background. Lois is devoted to Peter and despite all his idiotic ideas, she stands by him.The beauty of ""Family Guy"" is it's relevance to modern humour. Whether it's jokes will remain fresh is unknown, but at the present time it remains hilarious, even after multiple viewings.Perhaps the finest part of ""Family Guy"" is the relationship between baby Stuie and dog Brian (both MacFarlane). Stuie is an intellectual with designs on world domination whilst Brian is an alcoholic who far too often is led astray by best friend Peter. These two characters, whilst completely random, are superb because they provide an air of intellectualism to balance out with Peter's stupidity.In general, the great thing about ""Family Guy"" is how much of an ironic cult programme it is. Cult programmes tend to be programmes which small numbers watch and will regularly quote from. Evolving from this original scenario, ""Family Guy"" is now a programme practically every person on the planet has seen at least five minutes of. Still, whilst never award winning and not as well known as cartoons like ""The Simpsons"", everybody still quotes the Griffin family at regular intervals.As an animation, ""Family Guy"" is one of the finest. With guest voices like former Batman Adam West, the series has regained it's popularity in recent years due to a strong student following. This is a well deserved following since ""Family Guy"" is perhaps one of the funniest comedies in recent years.

"461","Hi All..I'm a lil'ol English fan and have just found out that Fox have cancelled the show.... Why ??....I mean i'm really interested.... Is it that it's starting to get funnier than the Simpsons..(can't have that now can we ...) I mean...don't get me wrong...the Simpsons is legendary and an all round cracking watch...but its no longer quite as sharp as it was, whereas family guy...coarse as it may be..keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat to make sure you see every tangent / irreverent gag ...C'mon fox....bring it back...you know you want to...",NA,"23 September 2002"
"462","When Family guy debuted in 99, I was one of its biggest and most loyal fans. It was fresh, funny and the writing was crisp, clean, and pushed the envelope without being totally offensive. I enjoyed the show immensely for the first few seasons. However, it has gone completely south in the last four yrs. They are completely out of ideas and continue rehashing these stupid 1980s references and stereotypes. Half the audience wasn't even born before 1990. I'm 35, so I know where the references are from, but they still aren't funny. For instance, the cutaway in the most recent episode of the pair from the Facts of Life shaking her ass in strip club while the guys watch and she says ""girls girls girls"" totally not funny. The last episode was so appallingly disgusting, crude, and demeaning.Quagmire's musical number Sunday was X-rated. It was one of the most despicable scenes ever. Is Seth and his ultra leftist crew the only ones who find this funny? I hate G. Bush too, but I don't need this idiot shoving his hatred of ""W"" down my throat every chance he gets. Also, he takes totally demeaning shots at Republicans like when he spoofed Rush and J McCain. In the early years, the show was hilarious.And, even if Peter was an idiot, he was a lovable one as was Lois. Both of them are unbearable to listen to now. I used to love her character. she was risqué yet had a motherly nurturing personality. Now, she's just crude, demeans meg for no reason, and has a potty mouth. she used to support peter in the early episodes now she's just damn annoying. I cant stand Chris and Meg. His lines suck and her personality is awful. She used to be a lovable, amiable nerd who was constantly put down by her peers. I always found Chris horrible. he adds nothing to the show. Stewie was evil and compelling with his passion toward killing his mother.I loved how evil yet funny he was. Now, he's just gay and annoying. Its like they are trying to push his homosexuality rather than what his character was.Also, I used to love Quagmire but now the writers barely use him. He's given maybe one line per show ( a perverse one at that) and that's it. He's one of the best characters. Why they don't utilize him more effectively is beyond my comprehension. The secondary characters- Joe, Cleveland, tom tucker, Diane, really don't add anything to the plot or story. Why was Cleveland granted his own show? he sucks. he's so boring to listen to. I never liked him. Same with Joe. he yells so loud, is a meat head, and he's a cop- definitely don't like them either.In my opinion, they need to produce one excellent final episode then end the series.IF they don't, I won't watch again. These last few new episodes were extremely boring, uncreative, and totally offensive. The comedy isn't fresh anymore-simply degrading toward minorities, handicap, republicans, Catholics, etc. Seth, I don't need you shoving your political ideology down my throat. Seth your a talented fellow. You need to retrace the steps that initially made the series fun and fresh.Now, your just rehashing old stale material, overusing these stupid ridiculous irrelevant 80s cutaways, resorting to barf humor, degrading people etc. Seth you can sing, draw, and make people laugh. Do it in a classy , reverent manner. I wont watch another episode after what I saw Sunday. you need to end the series now. IT is dragging, boring, and you and your staff seem completely exhausted ideas.I mainly watch the show for Stewie, Brian, and the q man. Brian's dialogue used to be awesome. he's also underused. Also, he's just a pompous drunk idiot now too. It's really sad. This show has amazing potential had the writers stuck w/what worked for them at the end of the century. IF you can't recapture that spirit and energy, end the series now. I'm one of those fans who keep hoping that ""this next episode will be a great one.""Then, after watching this disgusting display, I turn the TV off disappointed that I wasted the last 30 minutes of my life and this crap.These cutaways now are so boring and stupid. Why does Consuela appear in every episode? They did a skit about the sport of curling, and she was sweeping the ice as the puck rolled. Totally dumb and not funny. And, when Quagmire fired the puck into that Canadian strippers pussy during that musical number Sunday, was the last straw for me. That was an x-rated skit. I might see it posted on you porn. IT was that gross. I'm not a prude or gay. But, I don't like senseless degradation of women for no reason. Seth, retire the series now. Do family guy fans a favor. It's a far cry from what it used to be. American Dad is much better. They should be equally good. End it now Seth-this is totally reprehensible. Just throwing sexual, gross jokes for no apparent reason isn't comedic or entertaining. It's just simply sad. You can do better. do one climactic episode and end on a high note. Also, your New Englanders, why did you never spoof ""cheers?"" that would be a great skit. peter as same, Brian as norm, Lois as Diane. that would be mad funny if done well. again give it up Seth. move on with your other professional ventures. good luck to you from a former family guy fanatic---Ken","1","16 April 2013"

Present-day Family Guy 2/10.","5","3 June 2021"
"464","The show, which played out like one one-liner after another has the potential to be a breakout hit.  Unfortunately it has to suffer the burden of being ""the next Simpsons"", or harder still to be ""the next South Park"". I think this show has a lot to offer to network television, but it's in a league of it's own.  The best animated show to hit television in  few years, with enough intelligence to endure for a long time.  My only advice would be to hold back some of the one-liners.  Give the audience more of a story to follow and I bet they'll want to come back for more!!",NA,"8 February 1999"

"466","The show, ""Family Guy"" is a cartoon on Fox television and Adult Swim. The show is about a guy that puts the ""Fat"" in father. The family is made up of a stupid and fat dad who falls down for now apparent reason and every time he recalls something of the past there is a hilarious flash back. There is a mom, Lois that can get annoyed with Peter, the dad but still obviously loves him to much to be mad at him for more than 10 minutes and is looking for something more in life then just being a stay at home mom the it almost murdered by her son, Stewie every episode. The son, Chris who adopted his father's jeans of stupidity and who has a monkey in his closet that supposedly was once a good monkey that turned evil when he found his monkey wife cheating on him with another monkey. Now the monkey almost every episode points and glares at Chris when nobody is looking. The daughter, Meg is very self conscious and is probably the least popular girl in her school just because of her glasses, her undersigned purse, and her unfashionable clothes. She is also admired by a red haired, geeky, creepy, boy who has tried to put moves on her numerous times. The dog, Brian who can speak and walk on two legs resembles, Snoopy from the old cartoon, Peanuts who is Charlie Browns dog. He is also probably the smartest thing in the Griffin house. This show in my point of view is more clever and more hilarious then Simpsons and South Park put together even though I love South Park.",NA,"1 July 2005"
"467","This show is funny at many times but the humor is at the same time, plan and stupid. You are always going into flashbacks or dreams of Peter's. The Simpsons is a better show.And by the way this IS a rip off of The Simpsons everyone. A nagging wife, a perverted father(usually the start of the problems and pretty much the main character), a fat-ass,dumb-ass son, a sister that is a very big nerd and tries to fit in, a baby(if there is another thing funny about this show it is Stewie, he is the best and the only reason to watch this), a crazy neighbor(Simpsons its Flanders the Christian, Family Guy is Quagmire the perv.), and finally a family pet(even though he does talk, walk, and drink).I still like Family Guy and you do get A FEW laughs from time to time but it doesn't beat the classic Simpsons. And I'm sorry to break all you Family Guys maniacs out there but I'm pretty sure it will be canceled in about 3-5 more years but The Simpsons have been on for about 20 years.Family Guy is an O.K show but will NEVER beat The Simpsons.","5","6 August 2006"
"468","In my opinion this show has evolved for the better. There is more of a story behind every episode and this makes it more interesting. A successful sitcom or animated series needs to be funny as well as interesting and this is the direction Seth MacFarlane is moving towards. Don't get me wrong the is still funny and still mocks and makes reference to events in any household but this show is moving in the right direction from all the success its already accomplished.Archer is a good show that not only goes for humour but creates a real plot for every episode and makes you fall in love with the characters. Family guy compares well to this.","10","22 July 2013"
"469","This show is the only show I know to routinely mock its viewers. The characters devolve instead of evolving, over the course of the show, they get progressively worse and worse becoming more and more unbearable. The writers have made an episode about every sick and evil thing you can think of, this show feels satanic at times. Brain and Stewie having babies, Brain giving Stewie herpies, Brain having sex with Stewie's gf. Brian convincing Meg that her staying in an abusive situation is the right thing. That episode were Brian says God doesn't exist because Meg is ugly. An episode that killed Brian for ratings, only to bring him back two episodes later and honestly considering all my least favorite episodes are about Brian, I wish they did kill him off. Honestly this show even without the countless amounts of horrendous appalling episodes still would be bad. This show is simply not funny, it's where comedy goes to die. Yeah seasons 1-4 are good, but it's a drop in the bucket at this point. I honestly wish Seth boarded the plane... I would rate this 0 stars if I could.","1","15 December 2021"
"470","""Family Guy"" has given countless viewers loads of laughs! The show has enthralled me since it first aired in January of 1999. The simple fact that this is only one of two animated shows (alongside ""Futurama"") resurrected by the fans after it was initially cancelled in 2002 pays testament to the fact that this show is hysterical! Too often, ""Family Guy"" is pushed aside as a plagiarism of ""The Simpsons,"" and that its humor is annoying since many of the jokes are tangents which have no relevance to the plot. The counterargument I present to the accusation of plagiarism involves a ""Simpsons"" episode. In ""Treehouse of Horror VII: The Genesis Tub,"" it can clearly be seen that the Simpsons is plagiarizing a ""Twilight Zone"" episode called ""The Little People."" This isn't the only instance of ""Twilight Zone"" references in ""The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror,"" but it was highlighted by a ""South Park"" episode called ""The Simpsons Already Did It."" Which brings me to my next counterargument about the humor of ""Family Guy."" To quote Mr. Seth MacFarlane (the creator of ""Family Guy"") when he spoke at the Harvard Class Day Speech in 2006: ""The boys at 'South Park' are absolutely correct. Those cutaways and flashbacks have nothing to do with the story. They're just there to be funny. That is a shallow indulgence that 'South Park' is quite above, and for that I salute them."" This is an accurate observation considering how the quality of ""South Park"" episodes has declined recently. Just relax and learn how to enjoy a joke, however it is delivered. It doesn't matter what the joke is, but what counts is how you construct it! These tangents the show often utilizes are creative and laugh-out-loud funny! I find myself often out of air from the irreverent jokes and unique style in which they are presented.In short, ""Family Guy"" gets written off too often by critics and viewers alike. While the tangents which have no relevance to the plot are the most famous (the 'Giant Chicken' gag comes to mind), ""Family Guy"" often times uses the same kind of toilet humor as found in ""South Park."" The simple fact is that this show garners such a loyal fan base that it was brought back from the proverbial grave by DVD sales shows that this show is here to stay and deserves recognition as one of the best, if not the best program on television today.","10","26 March 2008"
"471","The first few seasons of family guy were simply amazing. Great wacky stories and off-beat jokes that related to the plot. When I watch these old episodes I have to think to myself ""why did they mess with perfection?"" When I think back to the pilot, which was my personal favorite, the show actually had a plot and the random jokes were kept to about 3-5 minutes.Since Family Guy was brought back the show has obviously changed writers with Alex Borstein being the head of staff for writing, which has seriously damaged the show. Now the jokes are all the same, they are either an obscure pop culture reference or are just a long running joke such as the ""mummy mom mom mum mummy"" joke by Stewie which is just that quote said over and over again for 2 minutes. Also these jokes have nothing to do with the plot anymore, they introduce the joke by saying ""this is more ______ than when ""character"" did _________"" For example Peter is shocked to find out he is fat at the doctor and says ""This is more awkward than having sex with a rhinoceros that doesn't love you anymore."" To me this is just lazy writing with a joke that could be used in any situation and has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. The joke was not even funny.Following that the show has become more ""edgey"" for no good reason with more sex, religious, and historical references that are just put in to offend and shock the viewer rather than make him/her laugh. The show used to be ""edgey"" but was in the right context and had proper timing to make the joke work. When I see Stewie graphically beating up Brian for 5 minutes of an episode I am not entertained or amused.Family guy was a great show, but now the show is declining in quality very quickly and its only been 5 seasons or so. The Simpsons didn't drop off until about season 10.","7","17 November 2007"
"472","The success of ""Family Guy"" is further proof, as if any was needed, that quality is not always rewarded and bad work often meets with success. Seth MacFarlane, a polymath of no particular distinction (he does everything, but badly), created a show composed of various ripoffs: Stewie is a ripoff of the Brain from ""Pinky and the Brain,"" Meg is basically Daria, Chris is Ajax from ""Duckman,"" Peter is equal parts Archie Bunker and Homer Simpson.The show is second-rate in every way: bad writing, bad animation, bad voice acting (Seth MacFarlane does many voices, but they're all monotonous and indifferently acted), bad stories, bad characters. The so-called ""jokes"" are just references to various TV shows, movies and commercials; real comedy writing requires some characterization or a satirical gloss on what is being referred to, but Family Guy presents everything in dumbed-down form: it's a cultural reference, or a sex joke, therefore it must be funny There were some good episodes, mostly toward the end of the most recent season, but basically it's a not-very-good show for youngish viewers who think that a penis joke is ""cutting edge."" And that's the point: Family Guy is not very popular with people over, say, 30 -- hence its failure on Fox (and the show got terrible ratings everywhere Fox put it, except the indestructible post-Simpsons slot). But it has succeeded based on its appeal to teenagers and twentysomethings; it is, as someone said, a kiddie show for older kids, crummy comedy for frat-boys, about as cutting-edge as a Bob Hope special.The comparison has been made to ""geezer TV,"" in that some bad shows succeed because they appeal to elderly viewers -- Family Guy is a bad show that succeeds on the basis of pushing all the right buttons for twentysomething viewers. But at least Diagnosis Murder was fairly well written. Family Guy is considerably worse than any episode of ""Murder She Wrote."" So next time you scoff at your grandmother for liking the Lawrence Welk Show, desist, and scoff at your college-age cousin for liking ""Family Guy,"" one of the worst shows ever made.",NA,"4 January 2005"
"473","I didn't want to like Family Guy at first, assuming its inferiority to other animated Fox sitcoms, which will remain nameless.  The concept of a talking baby and dog just seemed outright lame to me.  As often as I'm wrong about everything else in life, I was hugely mistaken with Family Guy.  The show offers fresh snappy material with each new episode, though I'm disappointed with the recurring episodes recently.  Characters are unique and hiliarious, and while we haven't all that much depth to them yet we are only in the third season.The main selling point of this show to me is their allusions and flashbacks. Like watching Dennis Miller, the show has witty references that send me into hysterics and appropriately zany humor for those of us that just want to laugh at something stupid.  The blend is impecable.  Scenes like the ghosts comforting Pac Man upon his split from Ms. Pac Man and Peter attacking the chicken that gave him an expired coupon are only a few prime examples.  With each reference to something in their past that impacted them later on they cover it by removing us from the scene and throwing us somewhere completely different.  It's truly refreshing, and only achievable in an animated sitcom.True this show can cross the line with classification-specific jokes, such as potentially religious and racist pieces.  But if you're paying attention you see the satire in it and how it often makes the joke in defense of the minority in a way that's still hilarious.  A show that can mix in political commentary that evokes a gutteral laugh outta me deserves a round of applause.  I PRAY this show stays on TV, cause once Frasier's out there won't be anything else worth watching on TV.  I'm not going to settle for Blind Date or Cheaters folks, I need something I can WATCH not just stare at in disgust.",NA,"7 April 2002"
"474","Family Guy is my new favorite TV-show and for good reason. Family Guy is funnier, it's smarter, and it's better voice-acted than the Simpson's. Pretty much this is how it is. Peter Griffin is a simple family guy living in Rhode Island with a strange family. Lois is his loving wife and the only normal one.Stewie is there 2 year old son planning world domination, Meg is the drama queen daughter, Chris is the stupid son who doesn't understand anything, and Brian is there talking dog and the funniest of the all. With that the show brings forth a variety of hilarious characters and interesting scenarios including the apocalypse. What's makes this show brilliant is the way the incorporate modern themes and classical themes into the comedy. Soem parts are a bit more adult and on a few occasions goes to far but it's all in good taste. Each character has a great laugh and keeps the show going.Family Guy, I used too think was a show just trying to live up too the legend of cartoons that is now The Simpson. However Family Guy does not try to do this. The show is simply funny as hell and smart too. The show uses a lot of musical scenes, usually from famous films and make the scenes ten times as funny. It's great that FOX brought the show back and I hope they don't screw it up.Family Guy. Starring the voices of: Seth MacFarlane, Alex Borstein, Milas Kunis, and Seth Green.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars. Except for a few episodes.",NA,"2 June 2005"
"475","I love this show it is one of the funniest things i have seen in my life. I own all of the seasons and have watched them so much i could tell you every line of the shows. Although no matter how much i watch them it still makes me laugh socio much. It can be a bit edgy at times but i think this just makes it funnier, but be warned if you are easily offended some episodes are not for you. For all it is fantastic some of the jokes don't really register but maybe that's because i'm Scottish and don't get the American type jokes. Seth McFarlane and all of his team you are outstanding writers and have to carry on writing this excellent show.","10","13 November 2006"
"476","One I first heard about another Prime Time Cartoon hitting the networks. I figured that was enough. With The Simpsons and King of the Hill. But this show puts them to shame And not only other Cartoons but shows with Real people too. The comedy is fast and well written, But you must have an open mind and sense of human. Kind of like when you compare Green Acres to Petticoat Junction. Same sort of setting and premise. But Green Acres was much funnier and more hip than Petticoat Junction, Thats how I view Family Guy to The Simpsons.

My brother used to watch it a lot and i actually refused to watch it even if it was the only cartoon on TV. One day i just decided to watch it and it was about the beginning of the 3rd season and i couldn't help but laugh at stewie and Brian. stewie is probably what adds the HA to family guy.Some episodes that i have seen made me pretty angry, including the religious and racial scenario's. but if you look beyond that family guy is an outrageously funny show that will have you laughing out of your seat. now i am not a family guy freak. i don't watch every single episode waiting for the new one. i just come across it every now and then and get a good laugh.One other thing i really like about the show is peter and meg's relationship. Peter acts like Meg isn't part of the family which is downright hilarious.

"480","For everything that Family Guy is (funny, sharp, fresh, creative, outrageous), perhaps the most important aspect of it is that it has done things that no other show in the history of television has done.Family Guy is the only show to be resurrected the way it will be in 2005. It was cancelled (most say unfairly) by Fox, only to continue expanding its audience via basic cable broadcasts and a devout cult following. It is one of the first shows to make a huge financial impact with DVD $ales, hitting huge financial heights for any television show, especially a cancelled one.But that's not all. The Cartoon Network broadcast of banned episode ""When You Wish Upon A Weinstein"" in November of 2003 was the first (and to my knowledge, only) time that a cable program has beat out one of the big three networks (ABC, NBC, CBS).The show will be brought back to FOX sometime in early 2005. Although fan support played an integral role in the return of this show, that fan support would not exist if the product they love was not of such high quality.Seth MacFarlane and Family Guy have persevered and made it a long way not by gimmicks or luck or a sweet timeslot. They made it on something that so many television shows lack: quality. Family Guy is simply a creative and funny show that might be the biggest cult favorite of all time. When it makes its re-debut in 2005, one can only imagine that Fox will have a gigantic hit as the legions of die-hard fans tune in, as well as the casual viewer who just wants to see what all the fuss is about. Family Guy may very well be the show that usurps The Simpsons as the Fox network's ratings juggernaut.All riiiight!",NA,"6 October 2004"
"481","Family Guy is one of those shows that people like because it is funny, and very easy to follow. This makes the show boring to me because it is so simplistic. The humor is pretty much random which is funny but it becomes so predictable after a couple of episodes. The show focuses way too much on flash backs and references, and not enough on plot. An episode can contain tons of jokes, but nothing will happen, nothing is accomplished, and the characters don't change. This is what makes American Dad superior to Family Guy. American Dad actually has characters who learn, change, and evolve.The way the plots are set up are rather annoying. I feel like the development of an episode starts with the jokes and then ends with the plot. Truthfully, the plot of each episode is garbage. There are a couple of good episodes here and there but rarely are there any amazing episodes. As far as animation goes, Family Guy is extremely simplistic. Most of the shots/angles are all from a side angle. This means that there are A LOT of reused animations, reused scenes, and a lot of recycled material. It makes the animation come off as lazy and uninspired. All of the characters in Family Guy are awful. Chris is annoying and kind of selfish, Peter is insanely stupid and just so stupid that I cannot like him one bit, Meg is just annoying and I just wish she could be more likable, Lois is just annoying, Stewie may be the only likable character because he is smart, witty, and a bit more creative. Brian is cool sometimes, but he contradicts himself all the time so it is unbearable to listen to him. Overall the entire family is annoying except for Stewie. This makes me not care for any of the characters at all, which makes all of the stories not interesting. Another annoying aspect of the show is that the family members treat each other as room mates instead of as family. This is something Seth Mac does frequently in his shows and humor. I understand that the family is supposed to be dysfunctional, but in Family Guy none of the family members even seem to like each other in the slightest and they treat each other more as acquaintances.I admit that the show can be funny at times, but the lack of plot, character development, good animation, and good characters makes it rather unbearable to watch. All of the characters are jerks, all of them are selfish, and all of them are annoying.","6","18 June 2011"
"482","Before I start my review of the show itself let me say that I first watched Family Guy while season 3 was airing in the UK and stopped watching at season 12. I used to regard myself as a huge fan of the the show but times change...Let me say right off the bat I think seasons 1-6 still hold up well and I give them a solid 8/10 but seasons since then have slowly decreased in quality with the odd good episode (I will leave a list of episodes I feel are worth watching after season 6 at the end.)The show follows the Griffin family and co. on wacky adventures and cutaway gags. Nowadays the cutaway gags seem overused and the stories seems to be running out of ideas.The characters and colourful and the humour is tasteless but done fairly well (when it isn't shoving political opinions down your throat). When the show is doing stupid but wacky humour is when it is at it's best in my opinion.The turn for the show in my mind truly turning from good to bad is the episode 'Family Heirs' which features multiple incest jokes to the point where the episode revolves around it.As I said earlier in my review, here is a list of episode I believe are worth a watch that aired after season 6:The Star Wars Parody Trilogy; Believe it or not, Joe's Walking on Air; Stewie kills Lois/ Lois Kills Stewie; The Man with Two Brians ;Road to Multiverse; The Splendid Source ;And Then There Were Fewer; Road to the North Pole; The Big Band Theory; Back to the Pilot; Family Guy Viewer Mail 2; Yug Ylimaf.","6","11 October 2015"
"483","Right off the bat, its unconventional, got a lot of toilet humor, can be crass and often insensitive. Your typical Simpson fan might call it uncultured and an eye sore. But once you are past its first appearance, its actually really hilarious and in my opinion way better than the Simpsons. It caters to an adult crowd, while targeting the child within us. That bratty, arrogant and fussy child. Honestly speaking its the only show on right now, which manages to give a few laughs. Sadly shows like Bobs Burgers and American Dad are becoming evermore placid. If you are a South park fan this will be right up your alley. Finally for the artistic nuanced crowd, Seth MacFarlane manages to give glimpses of his sheer genius by giving odes to really popular pop/culture/political references, and just like the Simpsons, many real life stars have actually given voice to their characters.","9","17 November 2014"
"484","Family Guy is the hit 1998 show that continues to make the audience laugh. Now, like with the Simpsons I am going to rate the separate seasons because they all derserve a different rating's.Season 1: Excellent, showed lots of charisma in this series, a lot more stuff about what family's actually do then compared to other seasons of the show. I rate this season 75% Season 2: The show was getting really good by here and it seemed like the show was building with every episode. This season deserves a slod 83% Season 3: Best Season yet, show was using cut away gags to a minumem and the plots were getting funnier and funnier. This season gets 93% Season 4: Started to get a little carried away with the cut away gags in this season. This is probably the worst season in the show's history. I give it 69%.Season 5: Despite getting incredibly ridiculous with the cut away gags this season was a lot funnier then Season 4. The show was holding on to a certain thing called wit. I rate this season 77%.Season 6: 2nd best season, funny used gags well, cleverly constructed episodes instead of just throwing together some rubbish. I rate this season 91%.Overall: 81.33%","8","7 February 2008"
"485","It's painfully obvious that the writers of Family Guy have run out of ideas for the show. Season 14 is an absolute flop and should have never been published, it would have been better to end the series at season 13 which was already in the throes of death. At least I wouldn't have been as disillusioned as I now am. I had originally rated this show 10 stars, but with season 14 I'm lowering it to 8 stars.","8","17 April 2017"
"486","Family Guy is the funniest animated show around easily, with the exception of The Simpsons. It was witty, creative and just a stroke of genius, I tend to laugh out loud a lot during one episode, which is more than I can say about most other American programs.But I have to say, I don't care for the most recent series. I was mostly disappointed that some of the characters changed; Stewie seems to be less cynical in newer episodes and that was what made him a great character in the first place. And as for Peter, in my opinion, the funniest character in the show, has become less stupid and his lines are more offensive than offensively funny. The show's writers seem to think now that the shock factor appeals more than genuinely funny dialogue.As for other disappointments, the 150th episode was just a waste of time. Watching a extra long episode of Stewie and Brian in a vault was so pointless, I don't think I laughed once in that episode. And as for the spin-off, The Cleveland Show proved to be nothing like its predecessor.Over all, Family Guy writers need to pen better humour if they don't want the show cancelled for the third time.",NA,"20 June 2010"
"487","Quite a few people insist that Family Guy is a rip-off of The Simpsons- it isn't. Sure, the whole dysfunctional family thing is incredibly similar to The Simpsons, and they ripped off quite a few jokes, but the style of comedy is generally different. Family Guy uses flashbacks and side-references, generally to effect.And yes, Family Guy can be stupid- but it's funny, isn't it?My favorite characters are without a doubt the diabolical Stewie and Peter (although the talking family dog comes close).A very funny show that doesn't deserve to be labeled as a pale imitation of The Simpsons as it has. Check it out.",NA,"14 March 2006"
"488","I don't know why people are criticizing this amazing show. It still is and will continue to be one of the greatest show and not only in my opinion but to many others as well. It's humor and unique characters stands out and unlike any other boring cartoons I can actually remember some of the most outstanding episodes from season 1-12. Still a little improvement couldn't hurt... For me I have seen many other adult shows and many of them are either too inappropriate or to boring. And to those who consider canceling the show, you are 1 of 1,000,000 people who think otherwise. Anything can happen with family guy from surprising jokes that make me laugh to memorable moments that no other show has. Keep up the good work and continue the legacy!!!!","10","24 April 2014"

Dead on right when it's compared to 'Married With Children', above. I'd thought that kind of cheap-shot, groaner humour died with the previous show. I should say, I'd hoped. Still, I have the right to turn it off, and I do.",NA,"16 May 1999"

"491","Family Guy is like that annoying friend in your social circle. They are often unfunny, immature, and even malicious, and yet, you still come back to them anyway. You keep being friends. That is my relationship with Peter, Lois, The Griffin Kids, and the other minor characters in this controversial cartoon. The only thing that continues to piss me off beyond end is Brian Griffin, who is possibly the worst cartoon character ever created. Some say that Family Guy jumped the shark after his death, but for me, Brian's sweet demise brought me back into the show, despite Brian's replacement being bland to say the least. 6/10, would run Brian over again.","6","13 April 2018"

A sensible mother and a son always looking for a fun time....sounds familiar?Well, it doesn't matter! Family Guy stands for itself as a fantastic show, as said earlier, a bit like Simpsons - buuuut....slightly more rude and more sexual undertones ;-)At the writing moment it only reached three seasons, and I sincerely wonder why....however, rumours talk about a feature film and more episodes in the future.....so I'll be looking forward to that tremendously...",NA,"25 January 2004"

Yet, I think there should be more characters on the show. But I don't think there's gonna be any character better than Stewie. Stewie is definitely the best. STEWIE FOR LIFE!!!

I'm normally not offended easily but sometimes the show goes too far. Like when they say Stewie played MArco Polo with Helen Keller, they show him swimming in the pool saying ""Marco...Marco"" I thought that was just terrible. Or the time when Peter's father says something to Brian who's not Christian. Brian said ""Thats very Christian, believe what I say or i'll hurt you."" then Grandpa Griffin hits Brian with a rolling pin over the head. I'm not the best or most devoted Christian in the world but I still found it offensive. Other then that...good show.","9","13 May 2006"

It takes a clever mind to kill three birds with one stone- showcasing your political opinions, being sexist, and attacking people for a quality with which they were born all at the same time. It literally blows my mind that people are puzzled by why boys make sexual remarks that destroy girls' self esteem.

Meg reminds me a little of my sister, and Lois reminds me of my mom who I lost early in life. I love Peter who I can relate to myself sometimes getting into all kinds of trouble. And as far as Meg goes,I sometimes can relate to her in many ways. During my school days, I was not very popular and like Meg found it hard to be accepted.

"501","Family Guy was a cartoon that delayed in the late '90s on FOX, andwas instantly one of the most talked-about TV shows around.Some people called it too controversial and it was boycotted bysome religious groups, and FOX canceled it two or three yearslater. What puzzles me is that there was the same controversysurrounding The Simpsons when it first aired, and FOX stuck withit and didn't let it go, and it became a major phenomonon. PerhapsFamily Guy could have become the same kind of thing. Family Guy is a hilarious show that appeals to intelligent peopleand average people alike. It's got some gross out humour, somewickedly funny one-liners and the best flashback scenes. Theanimation is sharp and better than other cartoons, as the peoplelook real. Family Guy is still majorly popular, and you can catch it around9pm on Teletoon.",NA,"13 November 2003"
"502","I had avoided this show for a long time, because in preview it looked like it would be a lame rip off of the Simpsons.  Boy was I wrong.Superficially it looks very Simpson-like (animated family, two older kids, dog) but the construction of the plot lines is vastly different.  I love the use of flashbacks and the little oppositions set up (the parents talking about worrying about the kids wholesome development while dressing up for a session of S&M)It is absolutely hilarious, and absolutely NOT for kids.  I'm pretty sure that's why it wasn't so successful on FOX (do they work the word penis into every episode?).  That and they kept playing musical time slots.Now, however, Cartoon Network is showing it in their Adult Swim lineup, and I understand it is their highest rated show. It's on late at night when the kiddies are in bed, and in a place people tune in to watch adult oriented animation.  It doesn't hurt being on right after Futurama (another excellent show that Fox time slotted into oblivion) either.",NA,"30 July 2003"

It is a shame that they banned it in Poland.Anyway, for some reason people always try to compare it with other cartoons like ""The Simpsons"" or ""South Park"", it isn't fair so just chill out and give it a chance. I think that ""Family Guy"" should be good show for Monty Python's fans, because it contains a lot of satire and absurdity humor. Oh and i don't know where people can find this cartoon racist. It's not! They even make jokes about racists, rednecks, but also about people too touchy on racism. So, if you are unprejudiced, and loose enough to not be offended by political incorrect jokes, you will love ""Family Guy"".","10","22 June 2007"
"504","Family Guy is the funniest cartoon ever. It's the only programme that makes me laugh out loud every time I watch it. Peter Griffin is the most hilarious character in any TV series. Family Guy is better than the Simpson's's because it is much funnier. The Simpson's's ran out of ideas years ago, Family Guy is still fresh.I love how random this show is. I love the fact that Brian is a talking dog, yet none of the other characters think this is odd. My favourite character is Stewie. I've never been sure if the others can understand him, but that's all part of the humour. I love his attempts to take over the world.Family Guy should be prescribed by doctors for anyone who is depressed. If you don't laugh at it then you must have chronic depression.","10","24 October 2008"
"505","This is one awesome show, and here are the reasons why. First, there are random scenarios episode after episode. Second, the series has dozens of popular culture. For example, in the episode, ""I dream of Jesus"", Peter rediscovers his favorite song of all time: Surfin' Bird. I have been inspired to love Surfin' Bird and drive my family crazy with it. The first time I have watched an entire episode of Family Guy, was when I was eleven, and I was totally hooked on it, even though it's vulgar, it's funny! What else I love best about Family Guy is that it even did the Star Wars Trilogy, and I totally loved it!! The most hilarious episode would be ""The Splendid Source"", where it involves Peter laughing at a dirty joke so hard, he poops his pants. Every time that happened, I burst out laughing so loudly, my parents could hear me all the way upstairs, because I was in the basement.",NA,"4 July 2017"

"507","I remember wanting to watch this in the animation craze of 1998 when every network were airing at least seven animated shows; all failed.Unfortunately Family Guy was one of the ones that failed; a cartoon too clever for its own good.While watching this, this was a sharp edgy and witty cartoon, I realized that this is incredibly funny, maybe funnier than my favorite show of all time ""The Simpsons.""One guarantee is, ""The Simpsons"" never made me cringe nor has it ever made me gasp with wide eyed disbelief before. Inevitably deemed too contreversial the show was yanked off the air and found new life in cable reruns becoming so popular FOX network decided to begin airing new episodes.""Family Guy"" is sometimes so clever and witty and funny; and sometimes it's too witty. It's pop culture references and on the mark jabs at politics, ethnic stereotypes, and social issues seem too smart, almost too good to be true.This is practically what would be referred to as a perfect animated adult cartoon. It's characters are three dimensional with personality galore and wit to boot. Like many of the British sitcoms, the characters featured in here are so despicable and unlikable you end up loving them, and this show never pulls its punches.It doesn't ask to be liked, and when there's a huge guest star on the show it never makes a big deal.Just when you think the show is about to get sentimental it turns around and completely kicks you up the rear with one cringe inducing hilarious pun and joke after the other.No one is safe from ""Family Guy's"" radar as it jabs at every fad, craze, television show, celebrity, social issue, stereotype, ethnicity, and politician living or dead.There are many sharp edges that will upset a viewer and there's plenty of rapid fire unrelenting jokes in each episode to upset at least one viewer.There's pokes at abortion, slavery, politicians, murderers, criminals, and every television show and movie ever made and it's all so funny. Of course you have to have some knowledge of pop culture to understand the jokes.There's plenty of clever episodes including (my favorite) when the character Peter fakes his death and is being stalked by death who literally comes knocking at his door to take him into the afterlife and after he breaks a leg chasing Peter, the family does everything they can to keep Death stalled.Of course that episode is childs play compared to other episodes. The cast of characters and excellent voice work is what make this show so funny to watch. There's an alcoholic neglective father, a passive house wife, a daughter desperate to be popular, a simple minded large son, a talking walking booze junkie house dog and even a psychotic newborn baby intent on killing his mother, his worst enemy.At times this show may make you cringe, it may make you groan, it will offend someone eventually, but it will surely make you laugh out loud.",NA,"7 February 2004"
"508","Well! I can honestly say I've given Family Guy many tries. I tried watching it.. I just don't see what everybody else sees. All my friends put Family Guy in their ""Favourite shows"" list, and finally I decided to see what all the talk was about! It was stupid. They take the lamest things and try to pass it off as rude or witty, and it's not! I watched it and the whole time I was giving it the are-you-kidding-me look! It's not funny! The baby has a nasty voice, looks really ugly, and till I asked somebody, I didn't even know if anybody else could understand what he said. Like in Rugrats, nobody understood what they said! How was I to know this was any different? My opinion is just that it's not half as great as shows like The Simpsons that allude to so many great things out there and turn it into disgustingly funny or witty or subtle! Sometimes you may even go ""Hey I know what they're talking about""! But with this show, there is nothing there. The humour is dull and weak, and incomparable to other shows I enjoy. Example, Friends. What a hilarious show with REAL actors! I just find this such a rip-off show, and no wonder it's been canceled like 3 times? Hope all you viewers out there stop the conforming and open your eyes to better entertainment! GET THIS SHOW OUTTA HERE!",NA,"1 December 2005"
"509","Family Guy.....what can i say? It can be funny and stupid. The shows characters, Peter Griffin- the fat dad. Lois Griffin- stay at home mom Stewie Griffin- baby who wants Lois to die. Megan Griffin- the girl that everyone hates. Chris Griffin- the fat kid, who'll probably be in every relation to Peter someday. But he's a nice kid. Brian- the talking dog.Some may compare Family Guy to the Simpsons. It's hard to compare a show that has been around for twice as long as the other. (Simpsons- 20 years, Family Guy- 9 or 10 years depending on if they've made any new episodes recently) However, since the plots are similar, people do compare.Some of the Family Guy episodes have definitely made me laugh, hard. With those that were funny, there came the ones that were, eh. The humor used in Family Guy is not quite as low key as the Simpsons. The humor is more open because Family Guy is mainly directed toward +14 yrs old. They can mix and mash, doesn't matter. With the Simpsons, you're more limited with the jokes because kids as young as 9 or 10 watch it.Family Guy isn't really put together good when it comes to characters. A surprise could come to you in any episode, which is good and bad. The Simpsons was well thought out when making the characters. Even though both of these family's are your typical American family(not including the talking dog and the talking baby.) Back when most of the Family Guy episodes were funny, I would watch repeats over and over. Not even thinking about the Simpsons. Getting sick of these repeats and waiting very impatiently for some new episodes. When I found out that a new episode was coming, I promised myself I would watch it. When it came around, I was disappointed. That's when the show pretty much went down hill and I hardly ever watch it now. Unless it's repeats from older episodes. The Simpsons pretty much has gone through this but also comes up in some episodes.I wouldn't say I like one better than the other because they are both unique in there own way. Both have had there ups and downs.older episodes of Family Guy- 8/10 newer episodes- of Family Guy- 3/10","5","18 January 2009"
"510","This is a funny show if you're old enough, young enough, while knowledgeable enough to appreciate it and understand it. Younger viewers born throughout the majority of the 80s won't understand many of the pop culture references dealing with TV shows of the time or even childhood in jokes. Baby Boomers as well will be mostly confused. Even the difference between me born in 1978 and somebody born in 1982, is a pretty big cultural gap. I think this is destined to be a cult show that only a certain era or generation of people can truly enjoy.

"512","This is a show that has copped a lot of flak for being unoriginal and unfavourably similar to 'The Simpsons'. Ironically, that criticism itself is now quite unoriginal. True, creator Seth Macfarlane and co. couldn't come up with an original storyline to save themselves. But look back at some of 'The Simpsons'' best episodes and you'll find that they aren't entirely original either, with whole story lines dedicated to parodying films like 'Cape Fear,' 'Animal House,' 'Pulp Fiction,' and 'Rear Window'. Matter of fact, 'Family Guy' is a satire that is at its best when it is, to put it bluntly, directly lifting material and poking fun at it.My main problem with 'Family Guy' is that Seth MacFarlane can often come off sounding pompous, and because he overrates himself as a singer, he never misses a chance to stroke his ego by injecting an overblown big-band musical number. But then he throws in a well-measured 'giggidy-giggidy' and all is gladly forgiven.","8","8 July 2010"
"513","This show started out brilliantly, it really did, and there are still a few good episodes, but the show has shown its age, and it is rotten and senile. For one thing, its edginess is a double edged sword. It can be used to great measure, such as attacking faith healing, promoting stem cell research, and issues such as living in an abusive relationship. However, sometimes this backfires, as some messages are biased, poorly executed, or even wrong and harmful. And in later episodes, the show becomes flat-out sadistic on a human centipedian level. We get treated to: boring plots, needlessly long cutaway gags that are irrelevant, scenes of Conway twitty that last up to 3-4 minutes, that are just there to kill time since the writers cannot make a plot to fill in 22 minutes, and at this point, pretty much every character has done something amoral, even the ones you are supposed to like. You know you have created a twisted universe when the nicest character is the rapist quagmire.I'd actually not mind if the show stuck to being mean-spirited, peter griffin being violent and psychopathic is funny, making him similar to wario. What bothers me is that you're supposed to side with him. The man who abuses his daughter for not being aesthetically pleasing, murders people, and doesn't care about his family, has certain scenes that try to make him seem likable when he really isn't. Please, just keep him as a villain or anti-hero, and stop pretending he s an excusable human being. It'll just be a better story if you keep him as a bad guy.","6","31 December 2015"

Stewie's massive vocabulary and facial expressions make him one of the most classic characters i have ever seen and this show only has 40 some odd episodes.  And i hear arguments saying that the characters haven't been developed, but cmon EVERY character on this show has their own unique brand of comedy.  Something that you can't say for other animated shows like ""The Simpsons"" or ""Futurama"" (honestly i think that show sucks anyway).   I like the fact that FOX has decided to put the show on primetime on thursday at 8pm, but that will mean it won't get the ratings that it should due to ""Friends"" and ""Survivor.""

"518","Peter and his dysfunctional family are back on Fox for their fourth season, and believe it or not, this first episode of the season was probably one of the funniest of any episodes.Seth MacFarlane and his fellow writers did a great job parodying the Passion of the Christ in this episode. ""North by North Quahog"" revolves around Peter and Lois' going on a second honeymoon to get the spark back into their marriage (since Lois keeps having fantasies about George Clooney.) They wind up using Mel Gibon's suite in New York, and they caught.MacFarlane's signature cutaways are still intact, and in fact many of the side-skits were a bit longer this time. The voices are surprisingly still well done, with the exception of Seth Green's character Chris occasionally falling out of his voice.

Later seasons have became seriously more violent and more ridiculous than ever before!

"523","I know this is a relatively new show on TV, considering shows like the simpsons, but it is one of my favs now. The show does seem to take things from other shows and the flashbacks do get a bit annoying, but it makes up for it with good old retard humor. A lot of people don't like this show because it is VERY racist and has a lot of sexual humor, but people need to learn to laugh at themselves sometimes. Shows like this will be remembered by certain scenes off the show, like Peter singing can't touch me. Don't know why so many people complain, I think that's the reason there is a channel button on the remote. My opinion is this show is great, many many laughs off it, hoping for many more to come, a kind of new simpsons for people older than 10. One of the few shows I enjoy on TV, and hope they start showing it more than twice a month. Don't judge before you watch at least 3 episodes, promise you'll laugh a few times.","9","19 August 2007"
"524","I am from England, and the show is not that well-publicised or much-shown over here, so I didn't pick it up until the third series. Before that point I thought that no cartoon could live up to the standards set by The Simpsons, but I was mistaken.I got the Season 3 box-set ASAP and watched it within a day. I then got the first two series. By this point I had heard the news that a fourth series was in production and I was delighted. The first few episodes look fantastic, and I can't wait to get them all over here.This is no rip-off of any other show. It is original, hilarious and controversial in its own way. 10/10",NA,"7 August 2005"
"525","It was really good. When Stewies kills the vaudeville guys, it was a moment for the real fans. For some reason the writers had this hard-on for vaudeville that was never really explained. It's still not explained but it is very well addressed. I think there was some other good stuff too. They want more lines in this so i will fill it in with the following: It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV. But where are those good old fashioned values on which we can rely? Lucky there's a Family Guy. Lucky there's a man who absolutely can do, all the things that makes us laugh and cry. OK they still want some more lines. I thought that song was longer. I guess they just repeat the same thing over and over. I also like how Brian is basically a person but he had his distinct ""dog"" characteristics. Example: dragging his ass on the carpet, chasing the tennis ball and being fooled when Lois throws it, being afraid of the vacuum cleaner. These are all very nice juxtapositions put forth by the show.","10","5 December 2006"
"526","My, my. This series is over 20 years old. And I review it now, no matter.This series is supreme Comedy that everyone should watch. The best of the best, even though Simpsons is good, this hits the first place BY FAR.The show anyhow, is about a Family, A stupid Dad, a smart wife, a stupid son, an ugly(?!??) daughter, a drinking dog and a baby Who wants to kill his mother, such adorableness. Usually, the episode is about Peter screwing something up, Stewie and Brian 'venturing around in time, Chris being scared of a monkey in the wardrobe or Meg being bullied by her family and school. Ah, sounds like such greatness, doesn't it? And songs, ah, the songs, are supreme as well. A Bag of Weed, Shipoopi, Give up the Toad now, The Rose, All I Want for Christmas, Down-Syndrome Girl, Wonderful day for pie, Bird is the word or The Spirit of Massachusetts is probably not even a tenth of all the songs through out the series.If you have not, in some absolute ridiculous weird way haven't watched this show in one way or another, you must've lived somewhere isolated, really.

It was the funniest thing i have seen in a long time.  Sure the episode ""One if by clam, Two if by sea"" offended me a little because i am English, and that most of the things said about us wasn't very accurate or funny but you have to sometimes sit back and just laugh at yourself.  This is probably why it was axed because it offended to many people but damn it, it was funny!Sorry to see you leave Family Guy, i look forward to the movie.

"530","On it's original run (Seasons 1-3) the show is an 8 out of 10. Now this is pure garbage. This is on season 12, and it hasn't been canceled yet, it's filled with horrible, random Cut-Away gags, Time Fillers and more bad stuff to waste your f***ing time. The DVD's are pointlessly uncensored, despite the lack of real nudity and bleeped swearing. I get sick on how many times i'm hearing ""Giggity"" everywhere, this stupid euphemism for ""That's what she said"" is dumb. I'm baffled that this has an 8.4 on IMDb, while Home Movies has a 7.7, I don't get it, Home Movies is WAY better than this sh*t. Peter is a rip- off of Homer Simpson, not in a subtle way, it's blandly obvious. The world could be a better place if they just cancel Family Guy, and bring back Futurama, that being said, if you want to get into a good series, watch Futurama, even in it's bad episodes, it still stands funny, American Dad is also recommended.Overall, American Dad is better, Family guy gets a 4/10","1","18 November 2013"
"531","The simpsons really are getting a little boring, despite excellent efforts from the writers. FG's real competition, is Futurama. It is obvious from looking at early pilots of FG that MacFarlane didn't get nearly as much leech with FG and Matt Groening got with Futurama. But the only character that really suffered is Peter. Don't get me wrong, he's fun.. He's not very un-origional. And while Futurama does not have any really un-origional characters, the just don't have any as colorful as FG. I'm thinking of Stewie and Brian ofcourse. Stewie really is a classic. Diabolical little genious, future leader of the world, mocking people while they change his diaper ""Yeeesss.. You like cleaning my poo don't you??"" Brian too though, a synical, well-read snob, and full blown alcoholic. Meg really is what she is in the show... Boring. But she does do it well :) There isn't much to say about Lois either. It's a close race, but I supose FG's warped humor just really appeals to me.",NA,"6 February 2002"
"532","I can't remember the last time a cartoon made me laugh with such utter vulgarity and craziness!! Where do I begin?? I think that makes the show are the flashbacks. This isn't a show that leaves a lot to the imagination, it SPELLS EVERYTHING OUT for you, which is hilarious. For example, Peter makes a comment that he didn't fart until he was 18. Then we see a flashback of a younger Peter, and we hear a fart and Peter looks around and says, ""what the hell was that??"" BRILLIANT!! Also, the tv anchors Tom and Diane are hysterical. If only local news had more people like them!! Quagmire is my favorite character, and I laugh every time he says ""giggidy giggidy giggidy!"" Also, the Evil Monkey in Chris' closet is the best!As funny as this show is, it is definetely not for kiddies. There are some times when I have been boarderline offended, and I am NOT one who is prudish. One example of this show pushing the envelope is when he is asked to babysit for the Griffin children, Quagmire sites Megan's Law as the reason why he can't do it. That's just creepy. But then he babysits anyway!! Shocking stuff.As many times as they make my jaw drop, these characters can also sing and dance!! I'm a huge musical theatre fan, So I LOVE when they spoof different shows. Epsecially the episode where Peter becomes the theatre director, and he keeps changing everything around. When Lois expresses her dissaproval at all his rewrites ,Peter says ""I thought you wanted a good show! if you wanted to do a bad show, we would have just done RENT!"" this made me laugh espesially hard, because RENT is my favorite musical ever =)Well, i've babbled on long enough. I would just like to end with saying, Seth is a comic genius!!!",NA,"23 February 2004"

I can't wait for it to become a regular show when it comes to FOX!I think this show is better than the lunacy of The Simpsons, Beavis and Butthead, and South Park, those are shows I don't like anyway.  My favorite parts were when Peter tried to contact his angel good side and the angel was in the middle of the traffic jam!!!!!  LOL!!!!  And the Kool-Aid man bit crashing into the courthouse, classic!!!  The characters are funny, too, you got the fat, lazy Dad, the son who's just like him.

"534","What more can you say about Family Guy other than it replaces the Simpsons as the flagship of animated mass-market (non-cable) prime time entertainment. This is not a knock to the Simpsons- they have been and still are shaping the landscape with their innovative writing. Family Guy has pushed the envelope past good taste, common sensibility, and even adherence to 30 minute sitcom guidelines.The rough skeleton of the show serves as a superstructure for comedy bits which would be impossible to segue to otherwise. The illogical jumpiness of the main plots (Which are sometimes thin) to the gutbusting asides is the focus of many of the series' critics. I can only ask that those watching the series critically to get past this- suspension of sitcom guidelines is essential to enjoyment of Family Guy.It's not ""The Simpsons"", and it's not ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" (thank God). It's Seth McFarland's masterpiece, and if you don't take it seriously, it's really darned funny.","10","9 November 2006"
"535","This has got to be my all-time favorite show!, i noticed a lot of people have been comparing it to the Simpsons but this show is in a league of its own! I personally don't find the Simpson's very funny at all, but this show is guaranteed to have me in stitches at least three times every episode. My favorite characters are Stewie, the Mayor of Quahog,""someone's stealing my water"", and Chris who i believe deserves much more air time but every time he appears on the screen i practically wet myself laughing. I bought a box set of this not expecting much as i hadn't seen much of it but i was addicted and have watched it many times over. I have lent it to all my friends and every time someone brings up this show we all quote our favorite lines because this show is 'classic'. I live in Australia and i am very annoyed at Channel 7 for taking this off the air and putting it on at very late time slots. Anyways, if you have not had the pleasure of viewing this show yet then do as it is gold and i just want to take this opportunity to give my congrats to Seth Mc Farlene for creating this piece of genius!","10","30 August 2006"
"536","Here's a case of revisionist assessment of a television show wherein people grow fond and soft and warm towards something that was 'unjustly' maligned and received poor ratings then got canceled (ie Twin Peaks).Make no mistake: this show sucked when it was on and it will suck now and forever.  It takes more than a succession of pop-culture references to qualify as 'humor'.Don't let this show become thought of as one of those 'brilliant, canceled gems'.  It is not. It is crap. Bad jokes, bad drawings, bad voices, and bad, bad ideas.",NA,"8 September 2003"
"537","The first 2-3 seasons were ok... Never utterly hilarious, but good for a few laughs. It hits on some topics that are quite boring, and some of the gags go on way too long; for example, when Peter falls and hits his knee or whatever, he moans forever. The video cutscenes are super annoying and also go on far too long. It's almost like they needed fillers.
It's gone downhill after about midway through its run, I suppose. I just don't laugh anymore.. it's just not funny enough to keep me tuned in. Some of the skits and overall theme of many episodes are boring.It's ultimately forgettable and doesn't hold a candle to some other animated series like Beavis and Butthead, Simpsons and King of the Hill, which are all far better than Family Guy.","4","21 May 2020"
"538","I have to thank my wife to be to introduce me to this show in the UK. In fact - I don't even know if it ever aired here but thanks to Series 1-2 being available on DVD - I have been watching them.It combines the cartoon skills of the Simpsons with the anarchic edge of 'South Park' - without going over the top on gross humour. It is hard to see why anyone would like the oafish, insensitive and culturally uninterested Pete - but it works very well. What are liked about the show was it 'fantasy trips' when someonementions a subject - and you see the main characters in that situation. And it doesn't have the 'let's be cute' approach that I think always lurks around in the Simpsons. So my advice to fellow Brits - if you cannot find this show - ask a friend in Canada or USA to get you send a DVD set of the 'Family Guy' thisChristmas !",NA,"21 October 2004"
"539","Family Guy is, without a doubt, one of the funniest shows ever to grace the small screen.  The show itself is an animated masterpiece that doesn't often rely on the old gimmicks of situation comedy.  It is as irreverent to as many subjects as possible.  Another element that truly aids in the show's hilarity are the many obscure references to movies like Tron and show's like ""The Facts of Life.""The ensemble cast is stellar and all are perfect for the characters they are voicing.  The creator, Seth Macfarlaine, does many of the character voices including Stewie, the tyrannical baby with plans for world dominion; Brian, the sarcastic and alcoholic family dog; and the family guy himself, Peter Griffin, who gets into more trouble than any man should.  Alex Borstein does a fine job voicing the family mother, Lois Griffin.  She also voices many of the female stock characters such as news anchor Diane Simmons, Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa, as well as many others.  Seth Green's rendition of Chris Griffin, son of Peter and Lois, is hilarious and perfectly suited to him.  Mila Kunis did the voice of ultra-reject daughter and sister, Meg Griffin.The show also featured a fabulous group of guest stars which includes Adam West, all of Kiss, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Bob Barker, Candice Bergen, Ed McMahon, Kelly Ripa, and Wallace Shawn.Overall, the show was a comic masterpiece and was cancelled far too soon.","9","1 November 2003"
"540","Among the many problems is the father's constant bad behavior, mostly his complete lack of manners, He beats up everybody all the time, He kills people and the Cops just let him go so easily.

Basically, Peter never cares about her until the end in Every episode this was a complete waste of time. I really Hate Peter the Mean Spirited, Fouled Mouth, & Childish Father. His Main Catchphrase is ""Da**it"", he said it in almost every episode & I hate that word. It really bothers me & become very I'll Tempered and have Temper Tantrums and also break people's things. This is why Family Guy is a Bad Influence on Kids & Adult with Disabilities.This show is nothing but annoying. I don't know why it was created, and I don't know a single person who claims to like the show. It teaches the audiences to be rude, disrespectful, act violent, & Racist.","1","20 January 2022"
"541","**DEFINITE SPOILERS AHEAD**Some people have referred to this as part of the brilliant tradition of the Simpsons, but they couldn't be further from the truth. ""The Simpsons"" has (usually) been a brilliant parody of the flaws of modern U.S. society, mocking our wan acceptance of mediocrity, cleverly criticizing the unfairness of the U.S. economic system, and generally critiquing the remnants of racism, sexism, anti-Semitism, and homophobia which still taint our society. ""The Family Guy"" is the reverse.""The Family Guy"" imitates the taboo-breaking humor of Y2K comedy to camouflage its reactionary stance.Skeptical? Take a look at the episode attacking gun control.The way Peter Griffin's family treats him is the reactionary right's ideal of male privilege: he can be completely selfish, self-absorbed, violent, outright cruel to his children, and yet he is still treated as the head of the family For No Other Reason Than He Is The Father/Husband. This is not a good-hearted man who stumbles; this is an argument that merely being male is sufficient justification to dominate all others.Lois Griffin is the reactionary right's ideal woman. No matter how much her husband puts himself before her, she remains loyal to him. She has no sense of identity beyond her roles of mother and wife. In one episode she took on feminism to promote stay-at-home-mom subservient wife values.Stewie Griffin fits perfectly with the Dobson explanation of children. Read the Focus on the Family propaganda and you will encounter the steadfast belief that children are born evil and an eerie return of the Victorian belief that the evil must be beaten out of them. Thus Stewie promotes the idea that there are no innocent children, justifying the reactionary right's delight in corporal punishment of those younger and weaker than the average adult.The Griffin family solution to almost everything involves violence and a distrust of outsiders. Peter happily beats up anyone who disagrees with him. Sometimes innocent bystanders are killed off for a laugh, but as long as that person is not a member of the family, no one cares.I could continue, but I think I have made my point.""The Simpsons"" is the sort of program which points out to us how we need to improve ourselves.""The Family Guy"" is the sort of program which rationalizes excuses to remain just as lowly as we are at our worst.",NA,"5 November 2004"
"542","I've been following Family Guy ever since it first aired and like many others was angry at FOX for canceling it in 2002. At the time, Family Guy was unique because it blended pop culture from yesterday and today due in part to its cutaway gags. When it returned three years later, it hadn't lost its edge and was still funny as ever.However, the show began to lose its focus in the following seasons; I guess you can say that was when the new material settled in. The writer's strike back in 2007 further damaged the show. After the strike ended, the show became stale and even gut-wrenching at times instead of downright hilarious. It's now come to the point where I don't devote my time to watching the show anymore for a variety of reasons.The main reason I seldom watch Family Guy is because it's become too politically preachy. It has delved into some controversial topics that were improperly handled (i.e. revisiting the Terri Schiavo incident which happened five years before the episode aired). While most satirical shows criticize the left and the right, Seth MacFarlane only evangelizes his own beliefs, meaning he only argues for one point and against another. This is what American Dad is for, not this show.I prefer the characters back when they weren't fully developed; now Peter acts and is looked down upon like a whiny five-year old, Meg is constantly treated like crap, Brian is the preaching atheist, etc. The fact that Seth has a carbon copy characters on every show he has (Devoted but absent-minded father, driven-to-the-brink-of-insanity housewife, teenage daughter who's trying to fit in, socially awkward son, at least one talking animal or young child, etc.) also makes me question his creativity. It's also become obvious that he purposely wrote Cleveland out of the show in a desperate attempt to get black people to like him (I'm white and I think The Cleveland Show a disgrace; not just to blacks but to rednecks as well).Bottom line: Family Guy was in its prime in its original run and for the first season of the return.","4","24 January 2011"

It meant he could do ANYTHING he wanted to with it. The show is quick witted, fast as lightening, jokes come from everywhere and they are all so perfectly timed and well organized. Some people say this show is dirty, filthy, blasphemous and racist...well you're damn right it is but there is not ONE thing that these guys left out to make fun of. They tackle every race, every religion, every celebrity, every potty joke, every sex joke, they get it all, so I think that by being SO racist as to make fun of everyone, they aren't really racist...see where I'm going? huh?

"547","Okay yes this show can be laugh out loud funny at times but as someone who sat through every episode that has aired to this date I can't say I even like the show. Sure there can be a good even great joke every episode or 2 but sometimes there is none. Also almost every single character becomes assholes as they're worst traits are only heightened with the shows run time. Sure I did for the most part enjoy the very early seasons of the show but they definitely still had issues with characters among other things but the show gets worse and worse even though I see very small improvement in more recent episodes. Not to mention when this show tries to be serious anytime after the first couple seasons it falls flat on its face and it's almost insulting. This show overuses jokes and ideas as well. I could go on and on but to conclude I don't recommend this show unless you maybe have a good episode guide to tell you some good episodes or if you're just looking for a rare laugh or you're with your buddies because that can make it a lot more bearable.","3","16 March 2022"
"548","If Family Guy offends you or you simply don't get the humor, unfortunately this show is making fun of you and the masses of overly religious, dull, and politically correct people in America. So put your morals aside and have fun with this show. FG is a hilarious mind opener on the reality of today's society. Whoever said this show is for a young immature audience is very mistaken. With all the references to old movies and politics 10-80 years ago, I couldn't imagine any young immature kid finding this funny. Family Guy is definitely for a mature open-minded audience who are not afraid to criticize American society. Hats off to Seth and the whole crew who were able to make this show happen.","10","15 December 2008"
"549","The Shark is just waiting to be jumped.Leave it to Fox to cancel the show while it was still good. That's always been the pattern of many really good shows. Brought back with the help of a strong fanbase, Family Guy should have stuck to the original formula that had made it funny. True, it was raunchy, it was scandalous, it was blasphemous. But it was tight, and that's what made it work.Now, Family Guy's problem is they think they can get away with anything. It's what I like to call the ""dictator effect."" Bear with me. In their early stages, a dictator's reign is often on thin ice, but they often initially want to help their people. But as they solidify their standing, they'll consolidate power until it would be a death sentence to criticize them. Family Guy is no different.Comedy is comedy, but you reach a certain point where it ceases to be this way. Family Guy has replaced jokes like ""did you know Jesus and Moses used guns to fight the Romans?"" with ""I have Down's Syndrome and my mom is Governor of Alaska."" If the writers of Family Guy are trying to make a political or social statement, they go about it the wrong way. The best jokes about pop culture are being replaced with the worst jokes about abuse, abortion, homosexuality.I do enjoy most of the pop culture references on the show, especially when I've observed what they're trying to convey. Who thought Liam Neeson's American accent was awful? I did, and I'm glad to know Family Guy did too. But it's losing its touch. If Dennis Miller was being tortured into doing a show, that is what Family Guy is like now. The awkward jokes that drag on for a minute or more are just awful. We understand that the music video for Dacing in the Street was gay, but do you have to show the whole video just to prove your point? In the sense of the bigger picture, Family Guy is the prime example of the declining value of comedy in today's society. We have lowered our expectations, and so we get this. Comedy used to be about a good punchline and careful observation. Now it almost brings a tear to my eye to see what has happened. Look at those Comedy Central roasts they do. If you want to see what comedy is really about, look up the Dean Martin roasts on youtube or watch Sinbad. But now? Vagina? I just booked me a spot on the Tonight Show. Sex? I'm winning me a Mark Twain Prize! In conclusion, Family Guy is still a pretty good show. Not great, but not as bad as some of the other shows out there. But those writers need to get their act together. No doubt they were going to hell for presenting such blasphemous material. But now they can't go with a smile knowing that it was still funny. Instead, they have only their regret to contemplate.","6","8 December 2011"

I don't think that this episode, overall, is better than the others, but I choose this as my favorite simply because of the scene with the reporters giving their intro to the games.I thought it was crazy funny when the male reporter was saying how we just might have a good laugh at their expense and the female reporter says, ""Oh, I know I'll be laughing,"" to which the male reporter replies, ""Yes, after this is over, I'm sure we'll all be going straight to hell.""  Of course, I'm paraphrasing here, but that scene was just evil and hilarious.My favorite quote, if I got it right, is when Peter tries to escape from Death by running away from him and Death calls out to him, in a laughably unimpressed tone, ""If I could catch Flo-Jo, I can catch you!"", Flo-Jo being the Olympic track star who had died recently as of the first airing of that episode.

This show is everything that the Simpsons want to be. I believe that Seth MacFarlane [creator of FG] has created a way funnier show than Groening's Simpsons. Unlike Simpsons, Family Guy is actually funny. The show's clever jokes never get old and Peter Griffin has dethroned Homer Simpson.Personally, I think Matt Groening saw that Family Guy was a way better show that his outdated Simpsons. I almost certain he had a hand in the cancellation of this great show. It won't matter when Family Guy gets revived by either FOX, Cartoon Network, UPN, or Comedy Central. Then Groening can kiss his beloved Simpsons good-bye.","1","18 April 2003"
"555","When I saw the first episode of Family Guy, I was literally rolling on the floor in laughter after the Kool-Aid man scene from that episode.  I then spent the next week trying desperately not to burst into laughter again. Family Guy does something that few cartoons do, it doesn't necessarily focus on plot or character development every episode, instead it tries it's hardest to make the viewer burst into laughter harder than ever before. Never before has a cartoon tried this before.  The gags are so subtle that you will literally never see them coming, and went they do arrive, they burst into the scene and leave you breathless from laughter (the flashback scenes this show did were classics).  The humour is much more adult, but not to Beavis & Butt-Head or South Park levels, it's just enough to appeal to older viewers.  I am so angry that FOX didn't see the true potential that this show displayed week-after-week, they instead pushed it around and cancelled it repeatedly.","6","28 August 2002"

I think the Family Guys cult following is prompted FOX to let the creators of Family Guy go into production for a Family Guy Movie, which will see light in a year to a year and a half.

I don't like that kind of talk at all. I don't think it's amusing in any shape or form.On the other episode when Lois became a model, and she wore the crop top and high heels. They where acting like that outfit was so obscure. She's in her 30's. She can wore whatever she wants. So how prudish society is. We should be able to wore something feminine. What was she suppose to wore? When they went to the haunted mansion. That Stephanie women they hated got killed. When they went to the room where she was suppose to sleep in. They found her underwear, and made fun of them because they had flowers on them. I think that was stupid. It wasn't like they had Hannah Montana on them or anything. She probably didn't know anyone would see her underwear. Then Quagmire secretly raped her corpse. Which I find disgusting, even if they hated her. And if they thought she was ugly why would he want to rape her? That doesn't make any sense.I also don't like how they made fun of North Carolina. One of my favorite states. There some wealthy people there. And it a pretty good state in many ways. And they made fun of fat kids. They can't help it. And there fat kinds everywhere. I used to live in North Carolina.I also don't like how they made fun of Sarah Palin's down syndrome son. He didn't do anything to us. He was just a baby. They can bash Sarah Palin, but not her kids. Especially an innocent little kid.When Meg got a makeover, and become pretty. She become mean and out of control. Not all pretty people are that way. Ugly people can be that way too. Some pretty people are just as pretty on the inside.King Of The Hill is more humorous than this show. Everyone act like this is the funniest comedy cartoon.","6","1 July 2013"
"559","Family guy is about the Griffin family, which consists of Peter, the idiotic but generally well intentioned father figure. Lois, the sexy and sometimes abusive yet most level headed house wife. Brian, the intellectual self-loathing dog of the Griffins. Stewie, the once evil hell bent on world domination baby later turned gay. Meg, the well-intentioned but black sheep daughter of Peter and Lois. Chris, the under educated but spirited son of Peter and Lois.Much of Family Guy is based on the shenanigans of Peter and the grief they cause his family and friends, though often times his family and friends are involved in his shenanigans.Family Guy more often than not goes' for offensive humor, often times making light of very serious situations such as Rape and Murder. This is in fact to offensive for some, but I personally find most of it rather funny, because it is in fact just a cartoon.Something I must complain about though, is some of the long running gags...For example, the Conway Twitty bits...For those of you who may not have had the misfortune of encountering an episode which uses a Conway Twitty bit, this is how it goes...Peter finds himself in a situation in which he needs a temporary distraction, he then says...Ladies and Gentlemen Mr. Conway Twitty! and from there the scene cuts to an old video clip of Conway Twitty performing a song. This would be bearable if it only lasted 10 seconds or so...But these bits often times can last between 5 and 10 minutes. When you factor in that the with commercials removed each episode is only about 22 minutes long, that's almost half an episode dedicated to Conway Twitty. I watch Family Guy to laugh at the Griffin family and all of their misfortune. Not to watch old Conway Twitty performance's...Another thing I feel the need to nitpick is the musicals. Family Guy has had extravagant drawn out musical bits since the shows conception, and I personally have NEVER liked them. To me they just don't add anything to the show. On a plus side though when a musical bit does arise, I take it a chance to get something to drink and/or go to the bathroom, in essence its like a mini commercial break for me.The last thing I feel needs to be criticized about Family Guy is the pop culture references. Often times the show makes fun or reference's an actor or performer who I would be willing to be 90% of the show's audience doesn't even know who they are.Anyway with my personal nitpicks aside I have to say that overall I still do enjoy Family Guy and generally I can still expect at least a couple of good hard laughs per episode. If you think Family Guy's humor is to offensive then you probably shouldn't be watching it anyway, remember...As I said earlier, this is a Cartoon sitcom, not real life. Family Guy has even made cracks at things I personally could have found offensive if I wanted to...But I just laughed at it.If you have never seen a Family Guy episode before, watch it with an open mind and you will probably enjoy it.",NA,"30 October 2011"
"560","It's just not funny. Maybe a chuckle here and there but overall, vastly disappointing in how they're moving this once slightly-above-mediocre show to the depths of soon to be cancelled tv shows. South Park, rick & morty, bobs burgers, archer, and so many more have surpassed plotness nonsense.","2","1 March 2020"
"561","I have never seen a funnier or smarter show on TV.  The absolute comedic gems in ""The Simpsons"" that come along at best once every few episodes are churned out with amazing regularity on ""Family Guy"".  Every time I see a new episode, I pick up on another brilliant subtlety.  The humor plays on things that you've always known are funny in the back of your mind, but have never explicitly thought of.  ""The Simpsons"" and ""South Park"" are intelligent, often on or near the level of ""Family Guy,"" but they both pull too many punches with the jokes (less so with ""South Park,"" but its humor is more disturbing), and as a result don't inspire as many debilitating laughs. ""Family Guy"" is the perfect balance of raw humor and wry, subtle references. There has never been a better animated comedy on TV.",NA,"25 March 2002"
"562","I used to always watch Family Guy and still do sometimes. This show pretty much brought back Rick Asthly. But let's forget all about that and talk about the show. The Jokes are hit & miss but sometimes work. you may be wandering, ""Why are you saying positive things about the show if you gave this a 5 ?"". Well, to answer your question, i just got tired of the jokes. Seriously, The jokes that i mostly see most of the time are the ""Remember the time when...."" kind and It gets on my nerves sometimes. I rather watch south park or something else but i still like this show in a way. Hey, at least when i get bored, i can watch this. The show may not be that good but at least it's better then watching FRED on youtube. I Prefer Spongebob more for some strange reason","5","21 March 2009"
"563","It seems quite a number of people are familiar with this show, but my two cents are that while it has some decent moments, it falls flat for quite a few reasons.Family Guy is a cartoon that premiered on the American TV network FOX in the late 90's. It follows the life of Peter Griffin, his wife, Lois, and the rest of their odd family and many wild and dysfunctional characters they meet.This show would be a lot more engaging if the plots were more focused on. I feel this show lacks structure, and relies too much on sight gags rather than an actual plot. For example, the main characters will ""flash back"" to something (usually a pop-culture reference to an actor, movie, so on. Sometimes involving the characters themselves engaging with the person or event), which appears to be played for laughs, and usually breaking the ""fourth wall"" in the process. This wouldn't be so bad normally, but they do this to the point where it takes up at least half the show, eating away any sort of plot.Second, there is too much crudeness in this show for my taste. I don't mind the dark, twisted humor that appears every once in a while and sometimes the mild adult aimed innuendo, the potty humor gets me. Programs such as ""The Simpsons'', ""South Park"", ""Futurama"" and some other shows do have jokes about ""grotesque"" things, but they play it low, as Simpsons do, or often in the case of South Park, wrap into into a clever joke that is a nitpick or stab at the corruption and incompetence in our society. This show often feels like a string of fart jokes sometimes that is not clever or funny.This show also seems to recycle gags and jokes from previous episodes, such as the title character abusing his daughter (which got old, fast), his toddler son's closeted homosexuality and tendencies, and overused ""flash back gags"" as I mentioned above. (One involving them cutting away to a old music video of musicians such as Conway Twitty or Glen Campbell have gotten quite tedious.) And sometimes a joke will drag on for quite a while. (One episode that was parodying ""Star Wars: Return of the Jedi"" featured the title character, Peter Griffin, cuing several characters while a build up that parodied the scene in which Han Solo had to defeat The Sarlac and Boba Fett.Perhaps this show is not that bad, often times I feel it is trying to play off of success of programs such as ""The Simpsons"", ""South Park"" or ""King of the Hill"". Though this show has it's moments and some quite clever jokes, be warned, as the plots of this show are lacking, and the humor might not be for some.","4","24 March 2013"
"564","At first when I saw this show, it was good. But as the show went on, it got less creative, repetitive, and annoyingly random. The show began not to have any flow to it, and have all spots without substance. Too many random flashbacks take away from the whole theme of most shows. The jokes are cheap humor, as they love to make fun of pop-culture. This show is an overall disaster, and people think it is cool because its ""edgy"" and ""controversial""In retrospect, the show is awful. If you never seen it, don't even try it out. It is a waste of time. There are plenty of better shows out there, so don't waste your time.","3","11 May 2010"
"565","I loved the Simpsons when I was young, but as I matured I found Family Guy and when i compare the two now Family Guy is much funnier, Simpsons just looses its charm. Sure The Simpsons is good while we're young but as we get older so should our cartoons and Family Guy is definitely for a more mature audience. First of all we watch the child cartoon shows like Tom and Jerry, then Simpsons and at the end is family guy (considering your not too old for cartoons, which i believe you never are) Its like when we're young and we can't stand the taste of coffee, but as we get older we become more favourable of it. Everyone should have a point in their lives when they move from the Simpsons onto Family Guy. Don't let the childish nature of cartoons put you off, we all have a child within ourselves and if your finding The Simpson gags getting old give this a try. Family guy is like the Simpsons but more matured, like if The show had grown up like us, not with us. I can guarantee once you go Family Guy you never go back!","10","2 July 2007"
"566","I find, looking back, the earlier seasons of Family Guy are, overall (can't stress that enough)better than the newer seasons. In earlier seasons (2-6) there are plots written far better than those of newer seasons (7-12). However, in a show like this, plot is not as important compared to other genres because, in the long run, its all about laughter and entertainment (plot is still good...need good plot). Like MOST comedy TV hits, Family Guy is running low on new material, even though new material is achieved through the events and situations of the real world that will always continue. I still find it to be hilarious, I just feel if you picked 10 random episodes from seasons 2-6, I would probably rate 8/10 better than 10 randomly picked episodes from 7-12. (I exclude season 1 based on the fact that they were just getting started and they weren't all that great in my opinion)The show is full of laughs and shock but even heartfelt moments at times (especially in season 12...if you know what I mean) and that makes this show great. It was better, but it still holds up. Raunchy, original (for the most part), enjoyable, stupid and most importantly...FUN!","9","4 December 2013"
"567","Even though this show is vulgar, we all can't help but to crack up while watching it. They keep on shocking us with the events & episodes, not to mention how daring they are. Honestly, sometimes I don't knowvif this shoe is corrupting or good for us, for how much it makes us laugh. However , Ui think it's probably both, because the idea of showing such a daring and inappropriate show in a form of cartoon is actually so creative and inventive, as well as a new idea. Still, I really don't recommend it to people under 13 because of vulgar use of language and some inappropriate scenes, but who listen? They all watch it to laugh anyway LOL.","9","8 July 2014"
"568","Family Guy is a bad satire. It should take cues from the only decent cartoon of the modern era, The Simpsons. Family Guy takes potshots at modern american life I guess, but doesn't do so in either a convincing nor a comedic or realistic view of life. First of all we have a boring little snot of a baby, whose only comedic relief is that he wants to rule the world. Sorta like a jr. bush i guess, then we have a dog that is supposed to be intelligent? gee if i had a dog i would be a billionaire if the dog could speak. Then we have a snotty chick who is the sister, what her point is lost. Then we have the stupid brother, who's point is also lost. Then we have the wife, who is just a mock of Peggy Bundy, totally an airhead who pretends to have a point, If you want a cartoon that is funny and has something to say about life, then pass up on Family Guy, if you like crude obnoxious comedy which really has nothing to say then watch Family Guy, this show is for those people. Some people that are educated will like this show, most people with a brain however will not.",NA,"30 March 2004"
"569","Man, this show is really hilarious!I've watched this film ever since 2004 and I loved it. When the show, Family Guy, aired on television on January 1999, I did not remember a lot of parts because I was only nine years old and I was way too young to watch this show. This show really appeals me because the characters, such as Chris, Tom, Peter and Brian are freakin' funny! I also like Stewie's sense of humor. I also like this show because Stewie, for example, really annoys Brian and Brian likes to have some peace and quiet, but all of a sudden, Stewie appears and Brian gets really infuriated! The third thing I like about this show is because people, such as Peter and Chris, enjoy bugging Meg. It makes me laugh when people bully and bug Meg!!! It's really funny! The fourth thing I like about this show are the flashbacks that make the show more hilarious! I liked this flashback when Peter did a really stupid, dumb thing. Which was? When Peter said that he made a water slide in his own house! Now, that's funny and stupid!!! I strongly suggest for people who have not seen Family Guy yet, to see it because when they see it, they are gonna laugh out for 10 minutes straight!!! This show is freakin awesome!!! Oh, and one more thing that I forgot: the last thing I like about this show are the parodies. For instance, when Stewie had a bad time when he kept rolling around in a pinball machine! That was a parody of Sesame Street!!! I give this awesome, f-ing show a million out of 10: 1,000,000/10!!! See this show!!!",NA,"2 January 2006"
"570","If the 1980s were the decade for the sitcom, and the 1990s were the decade for Reality Television, then 2000s are the decade of the Animated Series. Proof positive is the unprecedented return of Fox's Emmy Award winning Family Guy.As popular television continues to focus more and more on The Real (A&E's Intervention), The Surreal (MBC's Fear Factor), and the mind-numbingly mundane (Cribs, The Real World, America's Top Model, Nanny 911, and Extreme -Blank- Makeover Ad Nauseum), the Animated Series offers writers and creators a literal blank canvas upon which to create all the laughter and drama we've come to expect from true television entertainment.And then there are the poop jokes.In Season 4, Episode 1 of Family Guy, titled North by North Quahog, Lois, Peter, Chris, Meg, Stewie, and Brian are all back for what promises to be a satisfying season. Those new to the show will be re-introduced to our old friends, but in their tried and true ""developed"" state, and die-hard fans will not be disappointed by the continuity of the characters and dialogue as the show transitions seamlessly from Season 3 to Season 4.As Seth himself said on the DVD commentary, in Season 4, the show is ""...finally hitting its stride.""

I hope this show will have a great impact on television comedy history. It really should. Seth MacFarlane is amazing and has a whole lot of talent.I recommend this show for anyone who is looking for a good, hard laugh...you WON'T regret ever getting hooked on this show! 10/10!!!!!!!!!!!!!",NA,"11 December 2005"

Like peter, the main character who is cartman and homer simpson combined, the wife lois, the drinking dog brian, the evil baby stewie who tries to kill lois, meg and brian, the teenage kids, and of course: quagmire, the sex crazed neighbor.i still can't believed it got cancelled. well, good humor has a drawback",NA,"3 July 2003"
"573","After that line I had to stop the player so I can cry my eyes out, roll on the floor and generally laugh pretty hard, just like on the most of the jokes of the show. The thing that I love the most about the show is that the jokes don't repeat and most of them are unique. I love comedy, watch A LOT of stand ups, movies etc. so I'm really down with it and you know what? Family Guy is Comedy. One of the purest and most natural actually. By the way, it won't be funny if you're not in fashion with what's happening around the World and in Hollywood in particular. If you don't find it funny, you really need to get out and see what's there. I'd give it more than just 10.","10","27 May 2007"

I did not think that Family guy would stoop to that level to scream racism in one of their episodes. We are TRYING to get this country back, and it is comments on shows like this that appeal to the black community to rise up against White people and the government. Seth, really? And the 'ooga booga' comment against the indigenous people of that island...really? That is as degrading as the 'N' word...I love this show, but if this is the route that your show is now turning towards to divide the people more, than I want nothing to do with it and will boycott my kids from watching...then will tell others and they will tell others.

This show has jokes that keep you laughing even after the episode is over. The only thing that ""The Simpsons"" has over this show is better vocal talent. This is by far the superior comedy, even the short lived series ""The Critic"" was more hilarious than The Simpsons.

Try harder but never prevail! I do have some stevie thing but I just put it on my window because my sister gave it to me and I don't want her to feel bad.That thing was freaking expensive!

"577","I haven't been watching this show very long but i can say it is the 2nd best animated comedy show I have ever seen (the 1st is South Park). I like the flashbacks when a complaint is mentioned, and the old voices are hilarious. The new voices are still funny but not as funny as they were in 1999. Some of the jokes they use in the ones that were just made in 2010 are cheesy, and I don't really get when someone gets injured they recover in like an instant, but that plays such a small role in the show you might not notice is at all. The animation is good, I think the size of the eyes are a bit exaggerated. but it is better than the simpsons where they don't even look like real people and the hair isn't detailed at all. But this is a very funny animated comedy show, it's way better than those other ones you see on TV.",NA,"21 November 2010"
"578","Family Guy is, to be completely honest, a very funny show. It has a lot a lot of laughs. That said, it is, to a certain extend, a rip-off of The Simpsons. I mean, looking at the families, Peter is Homer except even fatter and stupider, Lois is Marge except more whiny, Chris is Bart except, again, fatter and stupider, and Meg is Lisa except more unpopular and more of a nerd. Both families even have a dog and a baby (admittedly the Family Guy baby and dog are more entertaining than The Simpsons'). It's safe to say that without The Simpsons, there would have been no Family Guy. This is not to say that Family Guy should be dismissed. As I say, it is very very funny. It's potentially even funnier than the Simpsons. I think it probably is. One main difference, though, is that Family Guy, with characters which are really caricatures of themselves, lacks the depth of The Simpsons. The characters are really just there to deliver jokes, to a much greater extent than The Simpsons. So, my feeling is this: Family Guy is a terrificly hilarious show, and that is all there is to it.",NA,"20 November 2004"

"582","Family Guy is not a better, or funnier, show than the Simpsons (even in it's newest seasons) but I do grant it the honour of having the funniest scene EVER in cartoon history, involving a court case and a jug of juice. It's funnier then it sounds. That aside, the show was full of hysterical moments, involving people like Willy Wonka, Hansen, The Brady Bunch etc. One of the funnier scenes, also quite awful, has the father reflecting on the most disappointing day of his life-in a flashback we see him at the hospital being told his baby is a girl. Funny show, it was a lot funnier then people gave it credit for.",NA,"17 June 2003"
"583","Well done Fox for giving in and granting this superb slice of surrealism a fourth series, as it is one of the most innovative and funny adult comedies ever.For those of you unfamiliar with Family Guy's format, the Griffin family consists of fat, beer-loving couch potato Peter, sensible mom Lois, teenage daughter with problems Meg and naive Chris. So far so Simpsons. But when you discover the remaining two members of the family are Brian, a talking dog with a weakness for Martinis, and Stewie, a one-year old baby with plans for world-domination and severe matricidal tendencies, you get the feeling things aren't quite as straightforward as you thought.It has to be said that Family Guy's plot lines are nothing special, but where the shows genius lies is in its frequent, surreal flashbacks of life in the Griffin household. These couple the bizarre with the simply ridiculous, and there unpredictability is what gives the show's humour much of its bite. <example> Lois and Peter are talking about the theatre. Lois reminds Peter of the last time he interrupted a performance. Cut to a theatre performance of Cats. The three actors on stage dance around to music for around 30 seconds. The viewer will be spending this time trying to think of just how Peter interrupts the performance. What no-one expects is for Peter's car to suddenly drive through the set and run over one of the cats. it may just sound stupid here but see it on screen and you'd have to have the sense of humour of a rock not to laugh yourself silly.Possibly the most interesting characters in the show are Brian and Stewie. This may just be because they are the most surreal of the family, but they also have all the best lines and plot lines, especially in the special episodes ""Road to Rhode Island"" and ""Road to Europe"" where the terrible twosome leave their family behind to have their own adventures.With peripheral characters including sexual pervert Quagmire, Mayor Adam West (wonderfully voiced by the Batman star himself) and Death, Family Guy can definitely never be accused of taking itself to seriously. Family guy is wonderfully self-aware and, although frequent references to US TV shows and stars should in theory alienate non-American viewers, it rarely spoils the joke. In conclusion, Family Guy treads a fine line between intelligent satire and childish crudeness and comes out as the finest animated comedy ever, delivering its laughs with more frequency and consistency than the Simpsons ever did. Roll on season 4",NA,"27 August 2004"
"584","The show has never seen to disappoint me, it has great comedy. Funny violence, peter fighting a chicken, negative stewie cutting Brian's tail and shoving it down stewie's throat. I mean, its all amazing funny. One of those shows you would hate see go away. So far it has been canceled and came backed. Seth is a genius, he may be just as funny as Matt groening, maybe funnier. Seth has the right thing with stewie,but i can't sure if he is gay or not. We see him dyeing chicks, and then he goes to club where its all boys topless. I can't be sure if he doesn't know better, but he has proved himself a Guinness TONS of times. Who knows? Seth Green does and he said,"" kinda and kinda not."" well not that exactly, but kinda.","10","20 March 2011"
"585","This programme is one of the most original and funny pieces of television ever created. Eclipsing other live action sitcoms it has funny beliveable characters ranging from arrogant father Peter, to homosexually repressed baby Stweie to put upon daughter Meg. The best by far is the intellectual and articulate dog Brian 'who's well read and has a diverse stock portfolio, but is not above eating grass clippings and regurgitating them on the carpet in the hall'. The supporting characters are just as good, particulay the Woody Allen like Mort Goldman and sexaholic Quagmier. Is Family Guy a Simpson's for the new millenium?

"591","I LOVE this programme! I've heard others compare it to The Simpsons, but I dare say the writing for Family Guy is a thousand times more consistent than that of The Simpsons. Each time I watch, I fall to the floor laughing and I can not say that about that other show. Sure, at first glance, Stewie's character has the best lines, but his is only one level of a multitude that give me gut-wrenching guffaws. And to explain some of the ancient pop-culture references from the 70s and early 80s to today's so-called generation of 20-somethings makes a withered old crone as myself giddy beyond belief. Hooray, Seth MacFarlane, I'll be having your baby!",NA,"13 November 2004"
"592","I know it's just a cartoon and it's obviously not real, but I HATE how they always have to incorporate animals getting killed/abused. Can't there be a TV show that doesn't include that kind of thing? They show it on several episodes and it's really just unnecessary and repugnant. Also, they have to throw in bashing on God in several episodes, too. Other than that it's a good and funny show.","4","9 April 2020"
"593","Why did Fox take this show off the air? Of all the shows that fox could have removed form syndication it removes one of the best ones. Family Guy is well written animation comedy about a family living in Rhode Island. The potential of this show could be seen on the pilot episode. And yet it's off the air while the Wanda Sykes show is going on strong. Fox has no idea what they have done and to all the haters out there probably don't get the jokes or there just a bunch of fairies.",NA,"9 October 2003"
"594","This, by far, is one of the funniest, and best shows in television history. Everyone can easily enjoy it. But, it, at times, can be out of line. And by out of line, I mean very out of line! Some jokes are funny while others are extremely racist, and offensive. There was even a joke about 9/11! Also, in one episode, The writers even had the nerve to show the prophet Muhammad's face! Some may think it's not that big of a deal. But, I even get offended when they show Jesus's face. But, all in all, it is still a funny show. It is very enjoyable! The time that they revealed that Stewie was gay was priceless! Despite how inappropriate the show can be at times, you just can't stop watching it. It's just too funny. The comedians who make up the jokes deserve a pat on the back, at least for the appropriate jokes. The characters are hilarious, lovable and One can easily be attached to one. So, I recommend that more people watch it. It truly is a fantastic show to watch!","8","14 June 2013"
"595","just have to say that family guy is a breath of fresh air. the Simpson's was funny but is just getting old, they're on to their 18th season now, so some new material like family guy does not bother me one bit. Family guy has some great characters, from the homicidal baby stewie to a talking family pet, the humor just keeps on coming the stories are varied and the plot sticks, if something happens in an episode, well it will stay that way in episodes to come Seth Mcfarlan has created a real funny comedy so fox, stop editing and censoring and just let have some real, un-censored anti-bush propaganda please p.s screw George bush and America","10","3 December 2006"
"596","Now, I know prime-time animated shows have been on the upswing in the past few years, most likely as a result of TAKING AWAY CARTOONS ON SATURDAY MORNING, but that's a rant to be addressed elsewhere. In any case, I can understand why Fox wanted more cartoons in prime-time; what I can't understand is why they settled on this particular one. Just because it's a cartoon does not implicitly make it funny, which it is overwhelmingly not.We've seen the big doofus dad before (""The Simpsons"", ""Dinosaurs"", ad infinitum...), the smarter yet still doting mom (reference the same shows), the undersized megalomaniac (""Pinky & The Brain""), etc., etc., etc...  So we don't have much original concept to work with, which would be okay if the script made up for it. Again, no jackpot. Aside from a few chuckles--mostly incited by the baby or the dog--nothing really entertains here. What's worse is the offensive, stupidity-mistaken-for-irreverence crudeness of some of the jokes. A female newscaster, thinking she's been knocked off the air, says, ""Well, I hate black people."" Ha. Ha. A child (in one of those incessantly annoying asides) holds up his JFK Pez dispenser, which promptly gets its head blown off by a bullet. He then remarks on how lucky he is to still have his Bobby Kennedy Pez dispenser, and... well, it's simply too asinine to recount.Many people have stated how this show is the next ""Simpsons"". Wrong. Other than a general similarity in family structure, nothing else even compares. What ""Family Guy"" lacks most from ""The Simpsons"" is blatantly obvious, or should be: Writers. Humor. Satire. Everything that makes Homer and Co. so great is simply not in this show. With any luck, Fox will do some shuffling, put ""King of the Hill"" back on Sundays, rescue ""The P.J.'s"" from failing to deliver on the incredible potential it's been thus far ignoring, and send ""The Family Guy"" to a nice spot in Hell.",NA,"5 May 1999"
"597","Peter Griffin seems to be the dumbest guy on the planet. He is lazy, very racist, and does not respect women. He has no respect for his wife, Lois, and yet she supports him and is faithful to him. He seems poorly educated and ignorant, does not take women seriously, and is mean to his daughter. It sends the message that if you are not pretty as a women, that you are worthless and don't deserve any respect. It is trying to counter what society is trying to accomplish by not taking women very seriously. Quagmire is also very chauvinistic. He does not develop a true relationship with women and is very shallow. This show is filled with gender-biased stereotypes and is racist.",NA,"27 October 2015"
"598","Family Guy isn't funny at all. Here are some of my reasons why I believe this. 1) The plot goes nowhere. A story never gets told. Even with The Simpsons and South Park there is at least some kind of discernible story whereas Family Guy really goes nowhere. 2) The jokes seem forced. It's as if the writers run out of ideas after the first five minutes of the show, and so they have to push any type of joke they can fit in. 3) The punchlines are too long. In a scene of the Willy Wonka parody episode, Peter runs home and hits his knee, then he sits and groans for about 30 seconds. In that 30 seconds, that joke went from funny to irritating. Another is when Peter fights a giant chicken. The fight went on so long that it gave me a chance to find my remote control. 4) The characters are underdeveloped and obnoxious. Granted, while Stewie and Brian are great, every one else is a one note shallow character. Meg constantly whines, Chris doesn't seem to have any personality at all (besides being stupid, but can that be considered a personality trait?) Lois is just Marge Simpson incognito and Peter is just annoying. All other characters seem to be there to just make one-liner jokes. 4) The animation style is derivative and dull. It looks like the shows creator, one Seth McFarlane, said to himself ""Well, The Simpsons look like this, so I will just draw my characters like this to copy the look without being too obvious."" Part of the charm of similar shows like Simpsons and South Park was that there was nothing else like it on television. Family Guys look seems like a spin-off of the Simpsons.I hope my point has been made. Take a look and find how many other superior shows like ""The Tick"", Greg the Bunny"", ""The Critic"" and ""Clerks"" get shelved and forgotten while something as unfunny and pedestrian as ""The Family Guy"" gets new life on T.V, and you'll see why I don't like this show.",NA,"21 October 2005"
"599","Family Guy has been out since 1999 and I still don't get enough of it. Every episode literally makes me Laugh Out Loud. When you hear some of the jokes that they say in the show you wonder how they can get away with it either because their to inappropriate or because they are to racial. I recommend this show to anyone that hasn't watched it even though its a very popular show. I like this show a ton because I am a big fan of Seth McFarlane. I love how Seth McFarlane does almost all of the voices of the people on the show. I am a big fan of comedy movies and TV shows so this is a big hit for me. I love when new episodes come out because I have seen almost every single one of them. I strongly recommend you watch this and you too will Laugh Out Loud over the things they do and say!","10","14 September 2016"
"600","Family Guy was, without a doubt, one of the 5 funniest shows I have ever seen on network TV.  In the first season, you would see a gag and go, ""*laughing* Oh my god, that is hilarious!""  In the second season you would see a gag and go, ""*laughing harder* Oh, my god, that is hilarious!  Can they even do that?!""  In the third season, however, you would see a gag and go, ""Hehe, that's pretty funny...haven't I seen that before?""  This was due to the fact that after the show was feared cancelled after the second season (despite winning an Emmy!), many of the good writers left, and they had to hire new ones when the show was renewed.  Of course, Fox had to kill the show by giving it the same time slot as Friends...why must they do that?!? Nothing can beat Friends, which sucks for whatever has to share that time slot. Anyway, what made Family Guy funny for me was the laugh-a-minute joke setup, with occasional shock humor (like a 70s-era Peter running up to Charles Manson and several others and saying, ""You guys!  I just got invited to a party at Sharon Tate's house!  Now you guys can come, but you gotta promise not to embarass me..."").  The kind of jokes that were filled to the brim with pop-culture references that would make you point and laugh and think, ""What must (whoever's being made fun of) think of that?"" (or sometimes, ""Why would (whoever) so shamelessly skewer THEMSELVES?""). Of course, I would like to praise Cartoon Network for picking it up for the station's ""Adult Swim"" time slot, and that there will be a DVD released. Rest in peace, Family Guy, and may you get a resurrection soon enough.",NA,"4 April 2003"
"601","This is my favorite show. It's very funny I love how stupid peter is and I love all of the jokes they make. Most of the older episodes I do not really have and interest for. The older ones do not have 3D in them and I do not really like that at all. My favorite character is probably Peter Griffin he is the one who makes me laugh the most like everything he does just get me. I also like how the creators of Family Guy make series of episodes like the Star Wars series they did. I think its funny how no one knows that Stewie is evil and I also think the creators should make it where they can understand him I think that would be pretty funny. I would recommend watching this TV show because it is very interesting and weird and it will just make you laugh a lot.","10","15 September 2016"

"604","Family guy is an adult comedy cartoon that has been canceled more times than i remember because of its overt nature. it follows the lives of the griffin family the worlds most disfunctitonal family. there is peter the over weight father who is a complete idiot, Lois the caring wife, meg their daughter , Chris their overweight son, stewie a talking baby who seeks world domination and the death of his mother, and their alcoholic dog Brian.the show has had its ups and downs in terms of comedy with the jokes becoming slightly more lackluster as the show has entered the 4th 5 th and 6th series which pale in the first comparison to the first 3 series. the show is comedy gold and isn't afraid to poke fun at anything or anyone. i hope you have enjoyed the brief plot description. heres me saying goodnight and gigity goo",NA,"18 July 2007"

"606","Family Guy is the funniest, the smartest, the greatest... need I say more? Creater Seth Mcfarlane plays the voices of Peter, The stupid father, the dog Brian, who has a bit too much to drink, and Stewie, the baby who is trying to take over the world and kill his mother. Their is also Lois, the mother, who is a piano teacher, Chris, the son, who has to face problems such as being more ""endowed"" then his father, and an evil monkey in his closet. Then there is Meg, the daughter who is embarrassed by her family and the biggest geek in her class who desperately wants to fit in. My favorite character is Stewie, because of all the crazy things he says and his voice. Seth Mcfarlane is brilliant for being able to put this show together. It got canceled after its 3rd season, but due to huge demand of DVD sales (Some stores were sold out the first day) It got put back on the air. This is a great show, and if you don't mind a few politically incorrect jokes, then you should watch it.",NA,"19 August 2005"
"607","I don't how other people feel, but I think i've outgrown the Simpsons now. It used to be funny in the earlier episodes but it doesn't hit my funny bone anymore. I am a massive fan of Family guy, it is just so funny and brilliant and I think it is more clever then the Simpsons.I love the way Stewie wants to take over the world but he has limitations and urges because he is a baby that get in the way. He is so cute when he wants to watch his kiddy programs and listen to nursery rhymes while holding on to his various weapons and mind control devices! I like all the characters but Meg is probably my least faviourite. I think that is done on purpose though, you have to have someone to annoy you (A bit like Lisa in the Simpsons). I can see that Family Guy would offend some people, but its great how they cover every subject you could think of, I think you have to have a sense of humour and an open mind to enjoy this. I reccomend everyone to see all 3 series if they haven't already.Great news about the movie!!","7","16 April 2004"
"608","Family guy is a cartoon with good animation, sometimes it can be funny but then sometimes it can be really doll like the jokes they'll spend like a whole 1 or more on one joke which has nothing to the plot which then gets frustrating BUT It doesn't mean I don't like family guy, just because sometimes it's not funny doesn't mean it's boring, it does have an interesting story line.Family guy is not like South park, South park is funny,funny and interesting storyline. The simpson is not funny but has a interesting story line Futurame as well American dad is OK and cleveland show is just terrible. But family guy can be funny 50% at times but some of their Jokes is pointless.When South Park is offensive they add a point but when Family guy is offensive they are just offensive just to offensive people in South park Stan said something like ""Believing in God cool"" in the episode passion of the jew but family guy is just offensive just to offend people which sucks.I like Family guy though because it's interesting and has some funny bits so I rate it 7/10","8","29 January 2013"

"610","Thank you, Seth Macfarlane! I feel like I jump right on in with all of Peter Griffin's shenanigans. Every episode has me laughing and it's a great show to watch to get you in a good mood. The show tackles some controversial issues but allows us to laugh with them. I know there are people who do not like this show and think it's trash. But every episode is hysterical and witty. Easily one of my favorite shows. I have no clue how it was cancelled before. I am also fascinated by Macfarlane's ability to voice so many of the characters. It's amazing! All of the voice actors on the show are incredibly talented and the writers are great! The script is brilliant! There's a great balance between the characters, with Peter and Stewie's outrageousness, and Brian and Lois' levelheaded-ness. I also love all of the pop culture references that are made. It's hilariously relevant!","10","15 November 2014"

Fair enough the idea of a dysfunctual family is a little bit clichéd, but their situations and some of the ideas certainly aren't. Rather than funny, this show is more witty which I much prefer. There isn't a character that I dislike in the show, you can't really hate any of them. My favourite has to be Brian the dog though.A very funny show, it's a pity they only show it on occassion on channel four.",NA,"28 July 2004"
"613","Back in the beginning, Family guy was an okay show. It had its moments, and was sorta funny. But now, oh now, it is probably the worst show on television. The thing that gets me the most is how FOX treats this show as if it is God Himself. The same thing with that Seth ""McFarFromFunny."" The only thing that keeps this show where it is at is the fans. I don't understand how it keeps its fan base, but with all the no-good college kids out there, there is a way. All the 1980s popular culture references, the cutaways, the jokes, and the attempt at humour, is all horrible at best. Peter, the main character, is probably the best character on the show. He has not changed much, but all the stupid crap that revolves around him is just sad. Lois, very good, but not great. Fatso Chris and Meg are just no worth drawing. They add nothing to the show, and are not even in that many episodes. Stewie is just stupid, and is only popular due to the fact that he gets 99% of the screen time, half of that is cutaways. Brian, oh that horrible Brian, is just there to be Macfarlane's little pulpit. Like Hawkeye Pierce was Alan Alda's on MASH. All he does anymore is spew the Democrat-liberal-atheist propaganda that Macfarlane wants everyone to be brainwashed to believe. Brian adds nothing to the show, and is just a soap-box for Macfarlane to mount and preach. All the other characters, except maybe Quagmire, and worthless attempts at trying to be cute.This exalted show from FOX has got to go. Another product from Macfarlane, American Dad, is a hundred times better than this crap. It is a REAL show, not just a sketch comedy. They cancel good shows like King of the Hill, and ridicule and try their best to cancel good shows like American Dad, but worship all of Macfarlane's pieces, like this and that dreadful no good Clevland Show, just another attempt to take AD's time slot, thats all. No doubt Macfarlane will come up with yet another show to try to gang up on AD, which is HIS show by the way.",NA,"13 January 2011"

"615","I'll go ahead and say it, I never payed ANY attention to Family Guy until about June 2002. It just didn't seem funny in the ads. But I did watch it, and I'm the happiest man on Earth because I decided to watch it. I think the reason I didn't watch it was because they used Stewie to promote it. He's not nearly as funny as Peter, whom they should've used to promote it. It's clever, well-written, nicely drawn, edgy, fast, and just wicked funny. There's nothing in the show that's taken seriously, like a lot of stuff in The Simpsons and Futurama. There's never a sad ending, everything's back to normal, and they just said something stupidly funny. There's something about The Simpsons that I've always wanted to address. It's a CARTOON! You can do anything in a cartoon, yet The Simpsons is more like a sitcom than a cartoon, because they fail to do anything ridiculous. In Family Guy, you can get transported to Narnia through a dryer, you can have a talking dog, you can turn the house into a giant puppet, you can become Death, become a fantastic pianist only when you're drunk, meet Death, or lose all your bones! The sky's the limit with this show! My favorite thing about the show is, nothing, I mean nothing, is taken seriously, and everything's turned into a joke. Everything sentimental is broken by a fart. A lesson learned is turned into a punchline. The jokes just never stop coming at you!",NA,"25 June 2004"
"616","This series is funny to most people, you either love it, or think it's stupid. I actually kinda enjoy it, except when they make shots at religion and god. I don't agree with some of the stuff they do. It is inappropriate but very funny and immature. I really recommend kids don't watch it because i know some kids that get way to out of hand with some of the stuff ''Peter'' does and they never stop talking about it. over all, funny series, i hope to see more. I recommend this for people that wanna have a good laugh, even if its a little immature. I watch it all the time, and its really funny i'm totally surprised its been around since 1999.

"617","A cheap knock-off of The Simpsons and The Critic, with lines that aren't as much ""humor"" as they are ""vague pop-culture references"". The fact that these references are inserted into what is otherwise a bland cast of characters does not make them funny in and of themselves. Ultimately, Family Guy is a one-trick pony for couch potatoes that watch enough TV to recognize obscure things from their favorite TV shows, commercials, and movies. I recognize most of them myself, but my recognizing them makes them no more capable of saving this worthless show.",NA,"13 December 2001"

"621","I gave this show a six star rating because It hasn't been great this past season. Usually for me the show would be an eight or even a nine but this season has been unfunny episodes and awful musical numbers. Seth Macfarlene has great political views (Forgive me If I spelled his last name wrong) but when he makes the show into his own little Broadway, It's kind of annoying. I hope next season is better and It doesn't turn out like The Simpsons did. I haven't been watching much of the episodes lately, but I've seen an episode here and there this season and It's been lacking in what the show use to have. At least It's not as bad as The Cleveland show.","6","27 June 2011"
"622","I didn't see Family Guy when it first came out. I didn't start watching it until its ""second season"" (has this show gotten through a full season?). Anyway, this show represents something that has been missing from most of today's comedies...sheer absurdity. I think that the high point of this came in one episode where Peter refuses a coupon, stating ""I had a bad experience once"" -- which digresses into a ten minute flashback involving a fight with a giant chicken (not a man in a chicken suit, an actual chicken!). This level of outrageous slapstick and zinging parody hasn't been seen since the glory days of the Simpsons (mid 90's, about when Seinfeld was really pumping out catchphrases). Things look bad for this show, but I sincerely hope that Fox hasn't given up on the Family Guy, since it's one of the few shows on TV to have critical acclaim AND viewer interest.",NA,"6 May 2001"
"623","I love South Park, I like The Simpsons and Trailer Park Boys is friggin' awesome, but the funniest show I have EVER seen in my life is Family Guy.

Anyway regarding the Simpsons family, does Maggie speak English? ... does Santas Little Helper speak? ... does Lisa get abused all the time for her annoying views? ... does Mr Burns like penis shaped objects? ... is Barney black? ... is Carl in a wheelchair? ... is Lenny a sex-mad man-whore? ... is Bart a 15 years old? ... does Marge have a brother? ... is Homer a fisherman? ... no? Still think this is a rip off of The Simpsons? Didn't think so!Fox being the smart dudes they are cancelled this show, probably because people were dying from aneurisms through how genius this show really is, however, finally Fox came to their senses in bringing this show back for 3-5 more seasons, with the DVD sales obviously being the catalyst. Again with Season 4 and 5 people say its lost it edge, but anyone who likes humour that is outstandingly funny will love Family Guy.

"628","When this show debuted in early 1999, this show was funny and amusing. When new episodes stopped, I was sad. When it returned in March 2000 , I became offended by the show because it started using sex humor for humor and the humor became unfunny.

I don't understand why people like this show, because the humor is cheap and lame the storylines are incredibly stupid.",NA,"25 January 2002"
"629","I've never seen such a show with such clever jokes like this one.  This easily tops The Simpons (especially the new ones) in funniness.  This show has been on a rocky road though, almost getting cancelled, though if the humour keeps up like this this will be a show for the ages.",NA,"2 August 2001"
"630","""Family Guy"" may have ultimately turned into one of the most disappointing television shows that I have ever viewed. Not to say that the show is terrible or completely unfunny, as it is neither. In fact, ""Family Guy"" can still be considered better than your average television sitcom. I suppose what truly makes ""Family Guy"" so disappointing is that it began as a show with so much promise, only to become a predictable routine in a matter of years.Created by Seth MacFarlane and released in 1999, ""Family Guy"" introduced the world to the Griffins, the family that ""Family Guy"" revolves around. Peter and Lois Griffin, along with their children Meg (a decidedly unpopular high school girl), Chris (an unintelligent and overweight teenage boy), and baby Stewie (a maniacal and seemingly intelligent child bent on killing his mother), and the family dog Brian (who can talk, drink alcohol, and is very smart) became extremely memorable characters. A different type of humor was used in ""Family Guy"", where nothing was considered sacred. OK, so maybe ""Family Guy"" was not the first show with those principles, but it used them in such a different way. Episodes of ""Family Guy"" usually contained a plot, but it was all laced with various references to different subjects, ranging from politics to pop culture. To add to that, ""Family Guy"" did not keep traditional boundaries as far as content is concerned, causing considerable controversy (for instance, one episode shows Peter wishing he were Jewish, poking fun at both Catholic and Jewish religion). Due to this, ""Family Guy"" was canceled twice by FOX (the station it aired on), but constant pressure from fans always brought it back. Indeed, the first three seasons of ""Family Guy"" made the show into one of my favorite television shows of all time, topped only by ""The Simpsons"". It is a shame that the show took an unexpected downturn so suddenly.Mabey the writers of ""Family Guy"" became blinded by the success of their own show, but whatever creativity that went into the early episodes has been gradually lost. Sure, ""Family Guy"" always had its flaws, mainly in the fact that it presented so many jokes and gags at once that it was inevitable for a fair amount of them to fall flat. Still, the good jokes usually outweighed the bad ones in the earlier episodes. For the newer episodes, I do not know if that still holds true. Most of the jokes given in present episodes of ""Family Guy"" have no creativity at all, mainly making obscure references to pop culture. Is simply saying that a random movie sucks enough to make a joke work? No, I do not believe so, but that is what ""Family Guy"" seems content with doing now. Actors, political figures, and musicians are still regularly lampooned in episodes, but in almost no other way than saying they are poor at what they do or portray them as monsters (literally). Honestly, I have come to expect much more than that from ""Family Guy"".Just as bad as those jokes is the character development now present in ""Family Guy"". Sure, the characters seemed varied and interesting at first, but they have simply become stagnant. We now foresee that Peter's friend Quagmire is going to attempt to have sex with a woman, the town pedophile Herbert will make a comment on a young man that he finds attractive, and Brian and Stewie will engage in long bouts of dialouge that are meant to be craftful and humorous but end up being simply long winded and pointless. Actually, Brian is a very odd character all together. Brian is a talking dog that experiences human experiences, such as relationships with human women. Perhaps the writers wish us to follow Brian as if he is a human, but seeing a dog go through such experiences is a little much to take in. It is painful to admit, but I can now go through whole episodes of ""Family Guy"" without even cracking a smile.Occasionally, an episode will come along that does some to return the glory that ""Family Guy"" once had (such as the one where the Griffins go to Texas), but majority of the new episodes are just disappointing. Fond memories of early ""Family Guy"" episodes still resonate with me, however, and that is what made me give the show the score I gave it (which is still not very high). Overall, it is just sad for me to see a show that I thought, at one point, do no wrong go so terribly awry. Indeed, it is just disappointing.","6","20 August 2007"
"631","It truly amazes me that a network could cancel a show like this.  They claim the ratings were never there, but then why is it that everyone from high school to mid-20s talks about this show as being even funnier than the Simpsons?  During my four years in college, everyone did Family Guy quotes. If the ratings were never there, maybe it was because viewers could never FIND the show because they kept changing its time slot every couple weeks. It really doesn't get funnier than this show.  Thank God it's being released as DVD.",NA,"30 May 2003"

Family Guy has ripped films off in some of its episodes such as American Beauty thats what i like about it, There is a movie coming out which should be funny,So this is a Simpson beater and delivers the funniness we expect. My favourite character has to be Stewie his accent is really funny and the way he hates his own mum is funny, Chris has to be the character with the funniest voice and hes just stupid. Also Peter the star of the show is just proper stupid I'd like him and Homer Simpson to meet that would be weird.

"633","""Family Guy"" is the real deal.  Although it falls just short of ""South Park,"" ""Family Guy"" completely obliterates ""The Simpsons,"" but that hasn't meant anything for the past decade because Matt Groening's brainchild totally blows.""The Simpsons"" wish they could be as sharp and witty and hilarious as ""Family Guy.""  The Griffins rock out with their cock out.  Peter, Lois, Meg, Chris, Stewie and Brian surpassed the Simpsons about twelve seconds into the show's pilot episode.  It was so much more fresh and funny than ""The Simpsons,"" and it showed ""The Simpsons"" for what it really was:  a washed-up, lame and terribly unfunny shell of what it used to be.Seth MacFarlane gave us network television's answer to ""South Park,"" the brightest, most intelligent show on cable.  Like Trey Parker and Matt Stone, MacFarlane packed a million laughs into every minute while providing strong political and social satire.  ""The Simpsons"" has never done that.  The only show on FOX that was better than ""Family Guy"" was ""King of the Hill,"" which will wrap-up it seventh sensational season this weekend despite airing alongside garbage like ""The Simpsons,"" ""The Pitts,"" ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and ""Oliver Beene.""It is a shame that the show was canceled, probably to stroke Groening and company's tremendous ego, but it lives on through the wonders of DVD.  The first two seasons (28 extraordinary episodes) are now available on DVD, and the third and final season (another 21 excellent half-hour installments) is due out this fall.I also suggest watching other cult favorites such as ""Duckman,"" ""The Tick"" and even ""Futurama,"" which at times was very uneven.""Family Guy"" was an underrated and unappreciated animated sitcom.  A true television gem.***1/2 out of ****",NA,"15 May 2003"
"634","Okay,this show is basically every fanboy's wet dream,whether it's a comic book fan or a Trekkie.This show has every reference to every pop culture being listed from A-Z.Sure,ya might not know most of them,but eventually you might get them.Some of my personal favorites are the references to musicals and actors of sort (Paul Lynde reference in 'The King is Dead' and the Grease spoof in 'Let's Go To The Hop').But the other thing that makes this show work,other than the cut-aways is the non-continuity bits.What this means is that they'll bring stuff up and never mention it again,like the Griffin's possibly real son 'Jimmy' being buried alive,or Lois finding Meg's tail,and we never hear of the incident again.One thing you'll have fun with this episode is guessing who's voice is who's.The main cast (those playing the Griffin family) has a huge amount of voices in this show,whether it's Seth Macfarlane playing Peter,Stewie,and Brian,or Seth Green using his regular voice as an extra while acting as Chris as the same time.Again,if you like the many references to the breakfast cereal mascots or the simple New England idiocy of Peter Griffin,you'll enjoy this better than the Simpsons.",NA,"18 March 2005"

And just like The Simpsons, you have your beloved characters.

"636","I truly loved Family Guy for the first few seasons it was originally on. Before it got cancelled, it was without a doubt my favorite show on television and each episode would leave you laughing for the next few days. I don't know what happened. Whether they fired all of their writers when the show was brought back on the air or what but Family Guy has become progressively worse. It is now filled with dumb random jokes, absolutely horrible writing, cheap shock humor, and is on a mission to shove its political views down your throat. You may still get an occasional cheap laugh but in the end Family Guy will leave you unsatisfied and empty. I'm sorry to say the show i fell in love with is now dead.","10","18 November 2007"
"637","There.  I SAID IT.  Without the Simpsons, there would be no Fat Guy.  I'll be the first to admit it: Simpsons is nowhere near as funny or entertaining as it was even a couple of seasons ago and yeah, it's finally starting to wear a bit thin (thanks to the less than stellar writing).  But it still gets more laughs from me than Family Guy, which hits a funny note once or twice throughout the whole show, where jokes are fired off at a rapid-fire pace.  The fat father and baby come off as somewhat amusing and the mom and dog have the beginnings of a personality.  Unfortunately, they're not funny. The kids are neither funny; nor do they have a personality.  They may as well not even be there.  Every time I happen to catch an episode on Adult Swim, I can keep a straight face with hardly any effort at all.",NA,"9 December 2003"
"638","I started watching Family Guy like... 6 months ago, and I really like it. Most of the jokes are funny and for the most part, the episodes have solid stories, so you might be wondering why I only gave this an 8. There are a few reasons, but the main one is this.The point of most of the episodes are meant to impose a view or belief, which is normally fine, but in this case, Seth Macfarlene sometimes does things that pretty much say: If you aren't a Liberal, you're an idiot. I could care less about politics, but I don't think they should put things like that in the show. It's not going to do much for you, except for get you to lose your fans. I don't care too much about it, which is why I gave it an 8. I'm just saying, it gets annoying. Honestly, the producers should know that they aren't going to get a bigger fan base by being a douche to half of America.","8","18 March 2011"
"639","""In a wacky Rhode Island town, a dysfunctional family strive to cope with everyday life as they are thrown from one crazy scenario to another."" That doesn't nearly express how great of a show this is. While other sitcoms take express jabs at character and ethnic views, this one goes straight to the metaphorical flea market known as ""popular culture"". Call it degrading, call it amoral, call it wrong - actually, you are, because I let my children watch it and I find it to be surprisingly tame - it sort of makes kids think they're getting away with something.It contains the following: Peter, a dumb gentle giant of a father, Lois, his wife whose voice an be compared to scrubbing one's ear with a Brillo pad, Meg, their unpopular daughter with social problems, Chris, a son who appears to have come from Peter's side of the family, Brian a talking alcoholic dog who thinks of a martini and a novel as a ""wicked good time"", and Stewie, a one-year-old who intends to kill Lois, but now must deal with his lack of bowel control and a British accent that comes out of nowhere.Very strict or Christian parents should think twice before letting their children watch this, but for those kids who like to repeat every childish, profane, and immature thing they hear, this is a goldmine.","8","29 July 2006"

I gave The Simpsons a 10, wouldn't mind if it gets canceled (they actually did get canceled, and a few years later came back, didn't affect me when they left).

"641","the day i watched the family guy was the day i noticed everything the Simpson's was missing...humor. don't get me wrong, I've been a Simpson's fan since i was 5. but the past few seasons i found were getting lame and violently religious. if there not talking or going to church there violently mutalateing someone. that used to be funny... 10 seasons ago. the family guy offers a different kind of humor. the funny kind. i can sum up the family guy in 2 words freakin Hilarius's. i think my favorite character has got to be stewie, the world dominating 1 year old. my only question about him is can they understand him cause sometimes it seems that they can and sometimes they can't. I think my favorite episode is when stewie gets drunk and starts hitting on a hooker and talking to her about the molecular theory. or when chris witnesses a robbery and when he goes to identify him, peter walks in to the room and goes up to the robber and says, ""have you seen my son, he's here to identify a robber, his name is chris griffin, here i have picture, you can go ahead and keep that chris messed it up by writing his class schedule and list of fears on it.",NA,"17 April 2006"
"642","The rest of the episodes, I've got on the computer...This is by far one of the funniest shows of all time.  This show is full of satire, pop-culture references, and slapstick.  Seth MacFarlane has excellently blended these elements to create a show that keeps you laughing with unexpected twists and turns.Yeah, I'm a fan of the Simpson's, and this show is like the Simpson's in several areas.  But there are several more areas where they differ.  The Simpson's are usually much more realistic and a family.  Family Guy exploits the families problems and is often very far-fetched.  Which creates a different hilarity than the Simpson's.I don't understand Fox.  They push that insipid Malcolm in the Middle like none other, not even realizing it succeeds because they put it right after the Simpson's.  They easily could have put Family Guy there, and had a two hour animation block that would have kept audiences rolling.  But, no, life is not perfect.To sum it up, it's a great show, it deserves more credit than it got, watch it on Cartoon Network, and maybe notice that recently, Simpson's have copied some ideas from it.",NA,"30 April 2003"

"644","I cannot precisely tell you the effect the first few seasons of ""Family Guy"" had on me. I was hooked. Some episodes were of pure comedy genius and I'm all nostalgic just thinking about them.However as I watched more and more episodes I noticed something changing. This wasn't the same spontaneous, crazy, out of this world show that I so used to love. It turned in a show where Brian tries to give me philosophy lectures of why God does not exist. Don't get me wrong as I'm not easily offended especially by a comedy show. Humour is supposed to satirize. Yet I never see them making fun of Muhammed for that matter either. It's probably for the best, otherwise they would long have cancelled the show. I'm saying all this because for me there's a difference between cheap, morally and religiously offensive, disgusting sexual jokes and clean and smart humour. At first it didn't tend to rely on the former as much as on the latter. That is real humour for me, not degenerated jokes. That is how a real comedian shows his genius, by not relying on sexually explicit jokes and mediums.I sincerely hope that one day ""Family Guy"" will move back to the good old fashioned values of humour it used to rely on. That was what made it so unique and worthwhile for me.","8","14 June 2011"

"647","It's incredibly difficult to truly know where to begin with 'Family Guy'. It has been criticised and applauded in equal measure since its conception and neither side truly wants to (or will ever) back down. Its detractors call it shallow, uncouth, repetitive and plagiarists, whilst its legions of devoted followers see it as a truly unique and brilliant product of out time.To be perfectly honest I'm gonna sit on the fence for this one. I hugely enjoyed it when I saw the first season and was able to appreciate the fact, that whilst hugely derivative of other shows it openly recognised this and took pleasure in lampooning its own shortcomings.However, aside from its cult devotees that will take pleasure in the show regardless of the directions that it takes; few can deny that the quality of the more recent crop of episodes has dropped in standard. Seemingly desperate to maintain the juggernaut momentum that it gathered through its first opening runs and the gargantuan DVD sales that it accumualated thereafter, it has appeared to have taken its own formula and mercilessly flogged it for absolutely everything that its worth.Popular culture references, slapstick, wordplay, surreal flashbacks and an almost endless string of parodies, puns, puerile sex gags, situational oddities and 'South Park'-style political satire. All have been crammed, squeezed and mashed together seemingly at random into exhaustingly short episodic spans of times. This would be great if they were building on a rock solid base of core material, but unfortunately they seemed to have sidelined the character building exercises and true narrative structure of the first couple of seasons for an almost breathless onslaught of punchlines and out-of-nowhere jokes that appear and disappear just as quickly.The primary result of all this is a rather empty feeling of dissatisfaction. You want to feel like you're laughing but its unclear what you're laughing at due to the vaporious nature of the 10-joke-a-second material.Don't get me wrong - There is undoubted genius here. It just feels so insubstantial given that there's no real structure or cohesive method of storytelling that I found it somewhat dull and lifeless after a few episodes. Seth McFarlane and his writing team clearly have an undisputed knack for bang-on-the-money, bizarre humour but it would appear to me that in their desperation to keep with their obvious peers - 'South Park' and 'The Simpsons' - they've gone and given us too much of a good thing. Maybe this is their intention and they're making a statement regarding the huge flow of available information in this day and age. Maybe not, either way its never too late to reclaim back lost ground (Unless you get cancelled again in which case, tough tits).P.S. One major trend I've noticed throughout this body of reviews in particular is that a large proportion of those with a 'pro' agenda haven't taken the time to correct their typo's. Spell proficiently if you want people to take you seriously! Cheers for the hating ;-)",NA,"13 May 2006"
"648","Okay, ""Family Guy"" is one of the most remarkable, hilarious shows of all times. It uses jokes that reference, history, pop culture, and it even has (sometimes funny) toilet humor. The May 1st episode is no exception. However... Seth MacFarlane should consider rethinking what he chooses to satire. I think that religion and politics have no place in ""Family Guy"" (other than the occasional reference). Past episodes of ""Family Guy"" have not had quite so many political and religious puns as did the May 1st episode. It is a no-brainer that Seth MacFarlane is a democrat/liberal. However, he should realize that ""Family Guy"" is watched by millions of people, some that are Catholic and yes some that are republican. While the May 1st episode was not TOO offensive, I could see him turning this amazing series into the unfunny mess that ""American Dad"" is. MacFarlane should realize that approximately 80% of American people are Christian and HOW much money did ""Passion of the Christ"" make? Also, half (or more than half) of America is republican and that includes a lot of his viewers. His whole comeback is based on whether he can gain viewership and if he keeps doing this he may notice a decline in Nielsen ratings. I hope that he sticks with the hilarious pop culture references and funny jokes that have nothing to do with politics and religion and leaves that spoofing to his piece of trash...""American Dad""",NA,"1 May 2005"

"650","This show was canceled 3 times only to come back after each time after huge fan support.If that doesn't describe a cult hit, I don't know WHAT does.Anyway, if you're at this page on IMDb, chances are you already know what this show is about. The first season was hilarious right from the first episode, something that didn't happen with The Simpsons' first year since it was cheaply made and written, only saved from visual images and minor jokes here and there, great that the other Simpsons seasons were much improved, but moving on...The characters are great, Peter's idiocy is a big highlight of the show and Brian's sarcasm steals the show. Stewie and Chris are great too, as they have their great lines and story lines. Lois and Meg are funny as well.The second season is hands down the best season of this show and might just remain to be. Any episode from that year are good reasons to watch this. The third season was also hilarious with the episode about the South.The fourth year? It's alright but the jokes feel forced and too direct and sight gags are officially removed. It still jumps hoops over the current years of The Simpsons, but the episodes are getting weak, especially recently with the gay marriage episode, the ""Peter gets shipwrecked"" episode, and without a doubt, the episode where Peter and Lois gets high and start folk singing. I hope the upcoming fifth year is better as this is still the best show on FOX Sunday with it's spin off, American Dad, only second.There were so many evening cartoons that were thrown off the air quickly due to bad network treatment, but to be honest, some of those shows deserved it, but Family Guy is the only one of them that could stay alive after being left for dead so long and for so many times.

"652","The funniest thing about this show is clearly Stewie. While generally the humor is funny and unpredictable, Stewie Griffith has to be one of the great comic characters of the last fifty years. He's right next to Homer Simpson, whom, Peter Griffith happens to be a fairly obvious exploitation of. But Stewie has no counter-part, no predecessor. He is wholly unique. At times he may remind you of Calvin, from the immortal comic strip ""Calivin and Hobbs"" but largely the things you will find Stewie saying have never come out of any other one year old in the history of the world or entertainment. But what so many of the show's fans fail to realize is that the show is actually done from the perspective of Stewie. This is the only way it makes sense.Watch the show with this idea in mind. The way the family reacts to Stewie's absolutely outrageous banter is usually perplexing. They seem to understand his intentions, his feelings, usually anger, but do not acknowledge his eloquence, articulate speech, or homicidal intentions. The dog, Brian, is a good indication as well. The fact that the dog is intellectually and morally superior to the humans in the family seems to be perfectly suited to a young child's view of animals. These two characters, by far the most intelligent of the family, also seem to share a unique understanding of one another. Brian is the only member of the family who actually understands everything about Stewie's personality, identifies it, responds to it, and even mocks it. Stewie does the same with the dog. While the rest of the family move moronically along through preposterous stories, the two characters who, in any other sitcom would be background scenery, snicker to one another and observe. Sometimes they take an active role in the plot, but this is usually when the plot pertains directly to one or both of them.",NA,"7 January 2005"

"658","Family Guy is easily the funniest animated series I've ever seen (with Home Movies coming in a close second), and is leagues ahead of The Simpsons in every way. The characters are more interesting, the jokes are funnier (although far less PC), and the show is altogether fresher than the overly stale Simpsons. Basically, if you're a fan of The Simpsons (and aren't easily offended), you should like Family Guy.One of the series' greatest strengths is in its reliance on an ensemble cast rather than depending on a single character to carry the entire show. Most of the characters are equally funny and no one is ever really reduced to playing Peter's straight man. Even the supporting characters (and a lot of the minor characters, for that matter) can be just as funny as the main characters and this leads to a refreshing change of pace from the typical animated comedy focusing on a lone frontman.The only area that The Simpsons can claim to have a hand up in is that of continuity. There are several glaring continuity errors in Family Guy (most are made in an effort to tell a random joke) that can be distracting if you're unable to suspend your disbelief. They aren't overly noticable... but for the nitpicker... they're there.Simply put, if you like The Simpsons (and can stand a few offensive jokes), you should love Family Guy. The latter is more intelligent (with references ranging from Marlowe to Warhol to Dallas to Jenna Jameson), funnier and altogether less tired and rundown.

"660","This show is, without a doubt, the funniest animated program on television, easily trumping the aging ""Simpsons.""  Nowhere else is ""Family Guy's"" unpredictable, spontaneous style of humor duplicated (perhaps the unfairly short-lived NBC sitcom ""Working,"" but this show really takes it to a whole new level beyond that).  The series relies less on seeing how a storyline will develop than the Simpsons (not that that's entirely absent) and more and attacking the viewer with a constant barrage of jokes and one-liners, which it pulls off surprisingly well.  The way this show delivers laughs by catching viewers by surprise would work well enough on its own, however, the writers go the extra mile with jokes that are also clever and lines that are very quotable.As the Simpsons will likely pass soon, Family Guy should be stepping in as its rightful successor, NOT being cancelled.  Goodness knows, if there's any show that deserves to be saved from cancellation a second time, it's this one.",NA,"5 May 2002"
"661","This is easily the funniest animated series to come along since the Simpsons. Nothing else even comes close. The writing is brilliant with each episode and never slags for a laugh unlike the Simpsons recently which tends to be a tad boring at times.Forget Futurama. Don't even waste your energy on King of the Hill (which is probably the unfunniest animated show in history). Save Family Guy!I cannot for the life of me understand how Fox would want to kill this show. They put it on against Survivor and Friends yet expect it to deliver ratings? No, that is where you put a show if you want to KILL a show. It is wholly inentional. And a shame.Hopefully, someone at Comedy Central or some other network like UPN or WB could give this gem a fresh start. Hopefully it won't be buried like the Critic was (another damned fine show as well).Brian and Stewie are incredible. Peter is funny as hell as are the rest of the family. The in-jokes fly at warp speed and the show has not yet failed to make me laugh out loud at least a half dozen times per episode.Truly a brilliant creation and kudos to Seth MacFarlane@",NA,"9 April 2002"
"662","Let me start by expressing my revulsion towards the Fox Network for moving ""Family Guy"" around, putting it in the death slot and eventually canceling a show adored by millions.""Family Guy"" was probably best known for its innovative inclusion of pop culture references and its uncompromising style of confronting common stereotypes.  Of course above all it was the funniest show I've ever seen! Part of its appeal was the enigmatic interaction of such diverse characters as Peter, the most politically incorrect and ignorant member of the family or Brian the intelligent, cynical talking dog or Stewie, the caustic and jaded talking baby whose barbs were a sheer delight to hear!  And that's just the main characters, let's not forget everyone's favorite pervert Quagmire!Another thing I loved about this show was that the humor never let up. Usually a comedy has a few bits that are 'laugh out loud' funny and the rest is filler.  Not ""Family Guy"".  The show was packed with gags, one after another.  Nothing else has managed to make me laugh as hard and as long as ""Family Guy"" has.A lot of people thought the show was offensive.  They're entitled to their opinions.  Personally though I think the show was socially cathartic.  It brought out all of the stereotypes regarding culture/race etc. out in open. When Peter refers to all Southern people as having bad teeth and suffering from the gum disease Gingivitis, he's just bringing a common stereotype out in the open.  Once people begin to face the fact that these stereotypes exist and are commonly believed ONLY THEN can we start to dispel them.Overall ""Family Guy"" was just a truly remarkable show.  If you missed it be sure to check out the US DVD release.  I'm sure you'll agree that such a witty and humorous show should not have been mistreated and canceled so early.  Fox has deprived us all and lost my viewership for many years to come.",NA,"10 August 2002"
"663","This show is the best show ever, i love this show very much because of the jokes and the cut-offs. Seth macfarlane is a very funny guy and Seth green is very funny guy and mila kunis is hot, and peter is a very funny character and meg is kind of ugly but mila kunis is hot so i don't get that so that is kind of funny but stewie is the best!!!! #Shutupmeg","10","28 March 2017"
"664","This show had everything and is quite possibly the funniest animated show ever made (including anime such as Dragon Half, Golden Boy and Ippatsu Kikimusume). The only other possible candidates that come to mind are The Simpsons (in it's 4th and 5th season golden age) and Stressed Eric (a little know British cartoon which I have only seen a few episodes of in it's bastardized, redubbed, American form.) I'm sorry to make the same cliched comparison to the Simpsons but it really is the only analogy that makes sense seeing as they're contemporary Fox cartoons targeted to the same audience with similar characters and humor, not to mention, as I said before, they are probably the two funniest cartoons ever made. But Family Guy is certainly not a rip-off of The Simpsons, even though it is clearly heavily influenced by it, if anything it is a successor to it (seeing as Family Guy came on the air at the same time that the Simpsons started to lose its brilliance). Peter, Lois and Meg may be very similar characters to Homer, Marge and Lisa, but Brian and Stewy are both incredibly unique. Family Guy's humor is also truly it's own, getting an equal number of laughs from pop culture satire, shock value and the just plain weird. It essentially relied on the surprise created by juxtaposing opposite, such as first featuring a joke so offensive that you couldn't help but laugh defensively and then immediately following up with an obscure quote from Voltaire. Even the extremely fast pace of the show was used to create an opportunity to do the exact opposite of what was expected, such as in one episode (Wasted Talent) when, as usual, jokes were flying at the rate of 3 or 4 a minute and then suddenly everything stopped with a 1:30 min. clip of Peter repeating the word ""ow"" after scraping his knee. When I watched this I remember being my confusion at the fact that they were wasting so much time to essentially dead air escalate until I was actually rolling on the floor laughing at the lack of a joke; the longer it went on the more time I had to appreciate just how hilarious it was that this show would intentionally do something so insanely unconventional. This was a truly amazing cartoon, and those who dismiss it because of the sometimes extremely offensive jokes aren't watching it correctly.",NA,"15 April 2003"
"665","OK, you may think I must be mad because of the quick summary, but I believe it is better. The one reason for that is that the simpsons is shown too much. I mean, it is shown every night here in Melbourne, and I also know it is shown every night on the BBC. Most people would be bored of all the repeats (some classics never tire out however). Meanwhile, Family Guy is hardly shown, so old episodes are still funny.Now basically why I like this show so much is because of Stewie. Who needs Maggie Simpson when you've got Stewie. Stewie is a one year old who has one goal: total world domination. He has an English accent, and loves destroying things. While he is a good character, Peter and Brian are good too.There are many real life TV shows and movies made fun of in this show, and they are funny too. For example, in Star Trek, Captain Kirk moved from one place to another between every word, there was one where Peter ran over Road Runner, and Wile Coyote was in the car and told him he'd hit nothing and to keep going.The show is ruder then the Simpsons but not as rude as South Park. It is funnier then South Park though, and the show should never be cancelled (apparantly it was once). I rate it 10/10.",NA,"4 December 2002"
"666","You cannot beat the comedy that the Family Guy has to offer. As the Simpsons rambles on year after year with less and less new episodes I had been looking for something entertaining in the Animated Comedy genre and The Family Guy filled the void. Not just the Main Characters, Peter, Lois, Stewie, Brian, Chris and Meg but the additional characters such as Quagmire, Joe, Cleveland, Mr. Weed and Cleveland Jr. make the comedy spread out over the show forcing you to watch because anyone could say anything. Personally I only watch the Simpsons to see what Homer has to say, but with the family guy an extra character could say something just as funny as the main characters. The Flashbacks and scene changes are a refreshing spin on the way animated comedy is conducted today. Personally, I think of it as the Seinfeld of Animated Comedies, You have to be smart to get it. I look forward to more episodes and can't wait for it to come out on DVD.",NA,"1 September 2003"

"669","""The Family Guy"" is probably bar none one of the best cartoons that have ever graced the television screen.

There are also plenty of supporting characters including Glenn Quagmire, Joe Swanson, Cleveland Brown, Mayor Adam West, Herbert, Brue, Conseula, Dianne Simmons and Tom Tucker a number of great episodes of the show and there some bad ones.

"671","I've been a Family Guy fan since early 2006. I'll tell you, I LOVED every minute of watching it. I've memorized each DVD now. Seasons 1-4 were AWESOME. There's no doubt about that.I was a bit disappointed this weekend when I bought the new season 5. It seems like each new video is getting cruder and more disgusting. It seemed like every episode from season five said f*ck once at the least and had disgusting bits of gore and bloody violence. WHat really got me was the cartoon nudity. Maybe it's just my fault for buying an uncensored season, but still. It completely grossed me out. I DO NOT recommend season 5.In all I'm in love with Family Guy. I love all of the characters from Stweie, the baby genius, to the greased up deaf guy, who lingers around Qoahog.I TOTALLY recommend seasons 1-4 and I hope you'll make it your duty to go out and get 'em if you are interested. Please think first before getting season 5, because it has to be the worst. Thank you and enjoy!","8","25 September 2007"
"672","Family Guy to its hard core fans, and even some more casual viewers, is the funniest thing to come on TV since the Simpson or South Park.  While probably funnier than both shows, it is filled with completely random pop culture references and absurde, Monty Python like events.  Those who don't get these references or dislike that type of humor may not get the show or view it as idiotic toilet humor.  If you do get it however, you will most likely become a devoted follower of the show.  In my opponion, it is the funniest thing ever to be put on television.  Family Guy may not have quite the same subtle intellegence that the Simpsons adds to many of its shows, it is none the less smarter than anything you'll find of Fox or a reality TV show.",NA,"15 March 2004"

"674","I've been a Simpsons viewer since it first aired (I'm 21 now), and i've alwaysloved it, but I have to say Family Guy is the new funniest animated series. Miles above ""South Park"" ( a novelty show at best with repeating Jokes that are funny only once like ""Screw you guys im going home"", Kenny dying, Stans a jew, etc), this show is what ""The Simpsons"" was in 1989. Never repeating catch-phrases and always delivering fresh, packed to the teeth with jokes hilarious episodes, I honestly can't see how ANYONE could watch this show without laughing atleast twice, sometimes the entire episode. How many shows can say that? One.",NA,"15 September 2004"
"675","How the hell did this show WOW the savvy Fox execs who not only green-lighted this train-wreck, but proudly elected to put on the ""budding"" new series immediately following the Super Bowl. Maybe they thought everyone would be too bombed to notice how pathetically awful and painfully unfunny this abomination actually is. Dumb, mean-spirited mugging and wisecracks, along with forceful, ram-it-down-your-throat sublime racist humour is one potent combination. So BAD, it actually had me ponderingthe comedic merits of that other FOX disaster, ""The PJs."" I thought we had sunk low enough there--at least the PJs has the charming effects of claymation to its credit.

"676","Yes, has got it all, a talking dog, a talking & insulting baby, a embarrassing father that has a mind of a 2-3 year old, a beautiful mum that sometimes gets her moments, a teenage boy with a mind like a person that takes drugs, and a teenage girl who wishes she was beautiful and that prince charming would take her away. It's a classic, and they say what ever they want in the series, sometimes I don't know how they get away with it. Basically, it's a rude, nude, cheeky comedy about a weird family on their wacky adventures. I would give this series a 7, because even though it may be strange, it will knock you off your seat (if your sitting on one). Although, Family Guy dose have it's bad side, you see, Family Guy is basically a copy off old series, like The Simpsons for one example, and it dose copy off other television movies or programs during some sessions.","7","7 August 2006"
"677","Family Guy is a cartoon show featuring the Griffin family airing regularly on Fox. The Griffins live in a fictitious town in Rhode Island called Quahog and are obviously meant to be a middle class family dealing with issues associated with that class. Family Guy poses as a typical sitcom in many respects. The show centers on a nuclear family, a theme which is anything but original in the sitcom genre. Many sitcoms have featured middle class families but Family Guy is not another generic sitcom. The cartoon is mean as a contemporary reaction to the media reality presented in the 1950s to the 1980s. Sitcoms, especially in the post-WWII era, idealized the middle class. The Griffins are very much parodies of the ""perfect"" families seen in such shows as Leave it to Beaver. As portrayed by the media, the middle class is supposed to be the bedrock of American society, standing alone in holding the rest of the country together. The Griffins are far from being America's moral compass. Family Guys is often criticized for using a crude, immature sense of humor. It is true the writers employ bathroom humor and foul language in the 30 minute episodes. What certain critics do not, however, realize is that this kind of humor serves a purpose. The humor of the cartoon characters dents the idea that all middle class families have impenetrable moral values. This makes Family Guy not only watchable but also relatable.The Griffins are over-exaggerations of middle class family life. This portrayal of the family as uncouth, gross, etc is a way to make the family more believable. Family Guy provides its audience with imperfect characters because it is hard to live up to stands set by other media. The coarse Peter Griffins telling an inappropriate story involving a rat while eating dinner with the ""upper crust"" of society at a yacht club, in the episode ""Peter, Peter Caviar Eater"" is a more likely depictions of most families than June Cleaver vacuuming in her pearls. The writers use this humor to attract desired demographic for advertisers. Shows and networks need to attract viewers because the ultimate reason for making television programming in America is to grab hold of viewers' attention and then sell us goods, through advertisements or product placement. Advertisers are especially interested in capturing the attention of the eighteen to thirty-nine year old male category. This demographic seems especially entertain by the foul language and bathroom humor of Family Guy. Young males, perhaps more than any other segment of the population, are believed to think pooping, farting, burping, etc is funny. Young males are also amused to see the traditional middle class family, meant to be wholesome, use foul language and toilet humor not usually associated with that class. Bottom line is: television is meant to be entertainment. People watch television to relax and unwind. After coming home from work, viewers don't want to think about complex things. The slap-stick humor used in Family Guy is anything but complex. Viewers are able to laugh at the shows on a very juvenile level. If you have never watched Family Guy, watch it! On a basic level it's entertaining to watch Peter Griffin stumble through various awkward social situations. On a higher level, the show provides witty commentary on a wide range of contemporary issues-both social and political. If Family Guy is not your idea of entertainment and humor, don't watch it. You can change the channel. No one is forcing you to watch the show. But maybe you could think about taking a page from the show and not taking yourself too seriously and enjoy a good childish laugh.","8","22 December 2008"
"678","Family Guy used to be the best out there but I guess Seth got infected by the woke mob and drank the Kool-Aid so he won't get cancelled. According to the season 20 episode I just saw, he's mocking JK Rowlings for believing that there are only men and women. So apparently Seth believes this is not the case? Most of the jokes on FG are based on sex. So, here's your chance to prove yourself to your new overlords Seth. Introduce a non-binary character and complete your membership requirements. But keep this in mind. The monster you're feeding now will eventually turn around and eat you.

"682","I love this show. It makes me laugh out loud more than any other show. The Simpsons was the best for several years but lately it's just not funny. South Park is still hilarious. Pound for pound, minute for minute, though, Family Guy is the king. There are a guaranteed 35 new episodes coming in early 2005, and they have the same cast and most of the writers, etc. coming back. I can't wait!There are a lot of pop-culture references in any episode, and if you don't get them then obviously the show won't be as funny to you. Also, there are a lot of crude and low-brow jokes which may alienate the more prurient. Fine, then, go watch something else. I feel like this show was written specifically for me and my sense of humor.For an animated series, Family guy is the shizzle as far as I'm concerned. I also love South Park, and some of the shows on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim are hilarious (Harvey Birdman, Sealab 2021, etc.).I like absurdity, like when Peter refuses a coupon from a teen in a chicken suit outside a fast food restaurant. Flash back to the last time a chicken gave him a coupon. First of all, it's a real chicken, and huge. Turns out the coupon was expired. So Peter goes out and starts brawling with the chicken, for several minutes, in one of the most violent and epic fights ever, on trains, helicopters, office buildings...That's Family Guy.As Comic Book Guy would say, ""Best...show...ever.""",NA,"19 May 2004"

Family guy is more adult themed than the simpsons which means it can get away with more. Lots of little hilarious segments are added in throughout the episodes which make it really funny as most of the time they have nothing to do with the episode, Such as Tony Robbins Swallowing Peter (The father of the family) Whole. Whereas the episode is about Peter trying to get back his money from a Phoney Door to door salesman by Getting a Jewish Lawyer. This series pure madness, but that is what makes it funny.

"689","Before people start jumping to the conclusions that Family Guy is much better than The Simpsons you have to remember that even though Family Guy was hilarious whilst it lasted, could it have stood up to another 12 series and still be as funny as the Simpsons? I doubt it. Thats not to say I don't like Family Guy, I think that in the 3 series it was around it was really funny and always had me cracking up, but perhaps ending it now before the jokes become poorer was the best thing to do.In summary I think Family could have lasted maybe 3 more seasons before it wasn't so good, but at least we can remember it as being one of the funniest series ever.",NA,"31 January 2004"
"690","The best show around since the decline of The Simpsons!!! This shows wacky, and hilarious characters make it the most popular cult show today. Don't let people fool you, this is a show in its prime, and has many more years of hilarity ahead of it. If you like the kind of cartoon that just comes from thin air, and hits your funny sense real hard, then watch this show as it airs almost every night on either Adult Swim, or a new episode on fox on Sundays. This show has been popular ever since it began in 1999 and it has gathered a huge fan crown over the past 6 years. Its cancel was a sad sad day for all of its fans, but when it was brought back, so were the fans, and it has not declined since. This is the kind of show with things on it that you will not forget for a long long time. this show is the new beginning for all cartoons every where, and it is a must see show!!!!",NA,"28 December 2005"
"691","Family Guy has always been one of my favorite shows and it always will be but you have to admit some of their seasons are nothing but filler, seasons 1-3 were gold but after awhile the script became a parody of it's former self. As of late Family Guy has been doing darker themes and I personally love it, most hardcore Family Guy fans may not agree with me on this one but I can honestly say that some of the show's best episodes are when they are being completely serious. Stewie and Brian have always been the main reason to watch Family Guy since they became a pair but some of my favorite episodes are when Kevin Swanson comes back from Iraq and another is when Quagmire's sister and her abusive boyfriend move in.","6","11 June 2013"
"692","Since the new FG episodes for season 5 will start airing next month, does anyone have a heads-up on any news about it? Like what are some of the episodes' plots about, are any new characters introduced, does Peter finally get a job, and most importantly how many episodes will be in the new season? I found that season 4 was too short with just ten episodes, and I think they said when they revived the show on fox they ordered 35 episodes to be made. so 35 minus the ten from season 4, along with the movie(3), that leaves 22 never-before-seen episodes to be aired.If anyone does the details about all this, please let us know!",NA,"15 August 2005"

"694","As it says, if you watch The Simpsons, watch Family Guy instead. Family Guy is a better show by far. With the hilarious mix of a fat retard, and a baby who wants to take over the world, you can't go wrong! First off, Family Guy isn't a rip off of the Simpons. The Simpons suck, Family Guy doesn't. Face it, the Simpsons is a show that has long since past its prime and they need to to stop making the dumba** show. I for one never watch it anymore. When it comes on, I watch one of my Family Guy DVDs while I wait for Family Guy to come on.Now it does sound like I'm bashing the Simpsons, and I kind of am but you know it as well as I do. The Simpsons is a dead show! You have to admit though that they have had a good run, but now need to make some space for Family Guy.If you haven't watched Family Guy yet....do it.",NA,"11 December 2005"
"695","For all of you who like unconventional twisted no limit black humor... Family guy is doubtlessly the show for you! It's definitely a sensation! ...more than 'The Simpsons', 'Southpark' and 'Monty Python' put together... Just when you think you know what's gonna happen, you think you predict a joke is on the way... they still manage to surprise you with a joke so unpredictable, so original, things you haven't even considered laughing about... and you fall down laughing like there's no tomorrow..... Enjoy!",NA,"10 October 2005"
"696","i used to look forward to the new episodes of family guy on Sunday nights. but the last few episodes have been so poor that i cannot believe that they are still on the air. it seems like they ran out of material after the family guy movie. don't get me wrong the first 5 seasons were absolutely brilliant, but they seem to have hit a wall with the writing. The show used to be cutting edge and borderline inappropriate, but it seems like they took it down a notch. almost to the level of the Simpson's. where is the crazy antics that i am used to. it could be that i just have grown up from the family guy ""age"", but i am only 20 years old and still enjoy a good fart joke. i just hope that its family guys slump, and the will come out of it to be back on par with south park.",NA,"20 November 2006"
"697","I really don't know how this show has lasted this long. My favorite show, ""the critic"" only lasted just more than 20 episodes. This show, in my opinion, isn't nearly as funny. ""Family guy"" is written in the same style (as ""the critic"") with pop culture references and flashback scenes but the humor just isn't laugh out loud type.In my opinion Peter's flashbacks are just a rip off of Jay Sherman's. Aside from the humor the characters aren't as defined as those in The Critic. I loved Jay's parents, Eleanor and Franklin, as well as his boss, his make up lady, his ex wife,his son, his sister, and his girlfriend, as well as countless other characters that rounded out the show to make for a hilarious, irrevrant comedy. Unlike The Critic the charactors in Family Guy just seem to hang around and don't help to round out the show. I hope Fox someday decides to revisit The Critic because it is in most ways much better than this show.",NA,"3 September 2001"
"698","Don't Get me wrong-I love this show. Family Guy, The Simpsons, and South Park rank as the holy triumvirate of animated comedy shows; Family Guy mostly for its first, second, and third seasons. The first three seasons not only were a fresh turn of comedy in an era of stupid assembly-line sitcoms but were hilarious no matter how many times you watched an episode. There are so many quotable lines in Family Guy and every one is and will always be funny. The show had a great sense of timing as well as a different flavor of comedy that included the lampooning of many stars in the entertainment industry and references to the pop-culture icons of now and yesteryear, some references more archaic than others. There is also the famous ""flashback sequence"" that occurs in every show, in which a member of the family guy cast remembers something humorous that happened to him/her, and the sequence itself sometimes is the punchline. It's a bit hard to explain, but the formula worked for the first three seasons. However, I think that recently Family Guy has been in a steady decline. Maybe because they got new writers, maybe because Seth Macfarlane is putting all his energy into American Dad, which is, I don't care what people think, a F***ing riot; but Family guy just isn't as funny or as cerebral as it once was. Maybe it can redeem itself; the show hasn't fully jumped the shark yet, but they should pick up the slack on better jokes while their audience is as large as it is. This is my first comment, by the way.","8","7 January 2007"
"699","I think that Family Guy is the best show ever.  I own all of the DVDs and I feel that all of you should do the same.  I believe that FOX lost big-time ratings when they cancelled the show.  Just look at what the Cartoon Network has done with it now.  I recently read that when  Family Guy was first released on DVD it was the highest grossing TV DVD of that year, and fourth of all time.  Many people compare the show with The Simpsons or King of the Hill.  I feel that this program has its own character and should not be compared with something just because it is an animated show.  The Family Guy has its own unique sense of humor that is outrageous and off-the-wall. The characters are fully developed, with each having their own input to the cohesiveness of the family.  I think that everyone should watch the show, on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, to see the genious program that Seth MacFarlane has created.  So, if you want to experience the best TV program ever, I say watch the Family Guy; you'll be glad you did!",NA,"25 January 2004"
"700","OK, so I don't think this comes to you as any surprise that this cartoon is not as good as 'The Simpsons', but it comes really close and this is why: 'Family Guy' takes the same approach as 'The Simpsons', in that it is structured around a family. Where 'Family Guy' is better here is that rather than to focus on other people in the town in some episodes instead of the family, the storyline revolves around each family member in almost equal amounts (including the baby and dog, who incidently can talk). This is unlike 'The Simpsons', which gives an unfair bias towards Homer and leaves out Marge.Its biggest strength however, is its jokes. It uses the same style as 'The Simpsons' with most of the jokes being intertextual references to other media, most of these are done better than 'The Simpsons', with the biggest problem being that they are sometimes too obscure to spot that particular reference.However, the programme does have its faults. Most episodes are packed so full of jokes that it seems almost just a matter of time before the programme will run dry (although thankfully this isn't evident in later episodes of the show!). Another factor is that although the animation is good, it is blander than something like 'The Simpsons' or 'Futurama' and therefore some of the audience will not give it a chance straight away.
Another problem is its obvious resemblance to 'The Simpsons' and although it doesn't feel like a rip-off of it, some of the jokes are in a very similar style. This is the main reason why I have used 'The Simpsons' as a main comparison. The storylines are also weaker than 'The Simpsons', as it relies heavily on the jokes.All in all 'Family Guy' comes very close to 'The Simpsons', with its biggest weakness being that its lasting appeal will never match that of 'The Simpsons'.",NA,"21 January 2002"
"701","When ""The Family Guy"" came on the scene in 1999, it was thought to be a weak duplicate of the Simpsons. But it shortly established itself by branching out into avenues, few shows have ever dared to tread. The twisted and comical nature of the show, along with is fantastical cast (i.e. - Brian, Stewie, etc.) proved to be a unique asset, and showed just how far you could take animation. It brought aspects of slapstick, Vaudeville, Hope & Crosby stylings, and general entertainment spoofs together to produce a whole new way to grab audiences. It was also a show able to entertain the young, but at the same time ensnare grown-ups who are not afraid to laugh at life & death. Its adult humor and historical references were lost on children, but gave the show limitless moments of comedy at other peoples expense. The only downside of the show in my opinion was that it was canceled ... ohh yeah and the episodes focusing on Meg Griffin (pee-eew!!!).P.S. - To respond to a previous opinion, the show didn't change after Season 1, it just expanded. The sexual humor was as integral as the slapstick or the fantasy aspects. The show was intended to use cheap jokes, and illogical (or stupid) story lines to present its comedy. (MadTV is also hilarious)-- Brian & Stewie rock !!!",NA,"22 September 2002"
"702","The Family Guy season 3 DVD is coming out sometime in September, in England it comes out July 21.... don't understand that, but anyways the greatest Family Guy Moment has to come from ""Da Boom."" No its not the 5 minute fight with the chicken which is hilarious, but it comes from the scene where Peter comes out of the basement w/ a plastic suit on to protect himself from Y2K and Chris sees him, and he shouts:Chris: Oh no its the government E.T. run!!!! (E.T. runs across the screen screaming)Its sooo random and its the funniest thing ive ever seen in my life, how they made fun of Randy Newman in that episode is also hilarious.Even tho Da Boom was great, the greatest episode definitely has to be the banned one, ""When You Wish Upon a Weinstein."" This episode has possibly the greatest opening scene after the song, and sooo many other hilarious parts. (My favorite is w/ Optimus Prime being Jewish.)Such a great show....",NA,"25 May 2003"
"703","This is the best cartoon show of all time better then the simpons.The jokes are brilliant and characters are funny as hell.If you like jokes about religion and won't get affended i prefer you watch this.But what I don't understnad why they cancelled it?????????????????",NA,"6 September 2003"
"704","I started watching Family Guy the first time it aired, right after the super bowl. Eventually I lost track of the show due to FOX's sporadic scheduling of the show which was the cause for the low ratings it received. I caught an episode here and there later in its run, and even managed to tape a few episodes. I remember very specifically the last episode I saw was ""Road to Rhode Island"". One day I thought, hey Family Guy, that was a funny show... I realized that the DVD was out and that it was running on Adult Swim, I soon fell in love with the show again.This show is mostly for adults, but it contains humor suitable for everyone. I've come to the conclusion there are many different levels of humor in Family Guy. Unfortunately the show is often referred to as ""low-brow"" which is far from the truth. A lot of people don't pay close enough attention to the show and quickly pass it off as ""stupid"". The show does contain some toilet humor, ridiculous jokes, and plain stupidity at some points. But that's not what the show is based around. I'm quite fond of the more ""high-brow"" jokes, and references that are made in the show, and I can tell you that these far outdo the lesser intelligent part of the show. There is also a great mixture of New England culture and references made throughout the show. You really need to see all the episodes to appreciate the show as much as it was meant to be appreciated. You also seem to have to know a thing or two about the show's background to really realize how brilliant it can be at some times... For example when Mayor Adam West says ""I've delt with supervillans before"" it's a clear reference to him being Batman (the voice of Adam West is used for the character Mayor Adam West), and then some.There is really a lot to the show, and the more you watch it, the more you pick up on it. I recently realized how well the episodes `Love thy Trophy', `The King is Dead', and `Running Mates' are written. In these three episodes they really use the characters a lot, and you really learn more about who the characters really are (of course there are similar episodes that do the same, see: Brian: Portrait of a dog, Road to Rhode Island, etc). A lot of people pass the shows plots off as thin, and the characters undeveloped. Once again, this is far from the truth, you actually need to WATCH the show to see that this is far from the truth. Each character, flashback, and flash cut are used for a reason for future or current plots somewhere in the show, no matter how obscure they may seem. There are also specific episodes where the writers went into detail about certain characters. Such as when the writers added the `Evil Monkey' to help elaborate on Chris' character. Chris is a big kid for his age, but he has a mind of a child. A common misconception is that this show is racist. It's not, any racist comments come from Peter, and Peter is a bigot, loudmouth, who talks before he thinks. So naturally, if you haven't paid attention to the show you would see it to be racist. They channel this attitude through Peter sometimes just to get the point across that he is just an idiot.",NA,"1 January 2004"
"705","You can never be bored with this show. It clings to your soul. Although it is not a drama, it still clings to your soul. What is better than watching an obese man making fart jokes. Nah ha ha ha. The great thing about this show is that it is always fresh. Whenever you watch it there's rarely any ""To be continued"" or ""Next time on Family Guy"". You never have to have that unwanted suspense of what will happen. You could buy the DVD to it and just sit watching and laughing at the politically incorrect humor.",NA,"25 January 2004"
"706","This extremely funny show is on almost every night on the Cartoon Network. It shows at I believe 11:30 PM Eastern time (USA) during the week. Great humor and the baby especially is enough to make you howl!! Peter Griffin is an idiot who seems to have no problem doing the insane things he does with no compunction ( is that a word?). Lois seems to have a lot of pent up emotions contained most of the time but every once in a while they explode and she becomes another person. The two older kids are hilarious. Just two teenagers; a daughter who hates her family and a son who is too stupid most of the time to know what is going on around him. But like almost all teenage boys he is a testosterone machine and it's girls and sex on the brain all the time. The dog is the most intelligent one in the family, if you discount little Stewie, who has a closet that Luke Skywalker would kill for.The neighbors are a riot, including the single guy next door who has the hots for Lois and in fact has pictures of her all over his bedroom closet!!I found the show by accident one night while channel surfing and I'm glad I did. Even my wife thinks it's funny!!!",NA,"6 December 2004"
"707","i disagree with your portrayal that family guy is not as smart and witty as the Simpson's. I'm a regular family guy and Simpson's viewer and i believe that family guy is funnier than Simpson's in many situations and family is more consistent. because if you have noticed the Simpson's is just no good anymore. The newer seasons are not funny not smart and definitely not witty. They are just...stupid. Homer is too dumb, Marge is too straight Lisa...well is Lisa and Bart does not have the appeal to the younger viewers as he did in earlier episodes. I remember liking Bart because of his rebellion ( what ever happened to eat my shorts!) The family guy however never slips up and is consistently funny and hasn't dropped in humor as it ages in seasons. i know that Simpson's is older than family guy, but you are saying that family guy still has not wit and is just plain stupid. Wellsir, i say no.",NA,"21 December 2004"
"708","Seth McFarlane has struck gold with this show. it may seem dumb at first, but if you keep watching you can see genius of it. Family Guy has great characters, including Peter, the dumb, overweight father who's always getting his family into big trouble, Lois, the patient mother who is sometimes pushed over the top, Chris, the fat, dimwitted son who is haunted by an evil monkey, Meg, the whiny high-school girl who doesn't fit in with anyone, Brian, the talking dog of the family who is the smartest there, and Stewie, the merciless baby who is bent on world domination and intends on killing Lois. After watching this show, I guarantee you'll be hooked.",NA,"1 October 2005"
"709","downhill really downhill, It just gets worse and worsethe only thing that keeps this show running is Peter Griffin and Stewie. That's fine and all but if its gonna be them 2 carrying the show don't make episodes centered around Brian or Meg (which at this point meg is muuch more likable than brian). Brian should only be a backup character when stewie is around, a sidekick if you will. They should have kept him dead instead of trying to force us to like this SOB.5/10 and thats only for peter and stewie seriously even the guy in the weelchair is a better character than Brian. THE RANDOM PEOPLE IN THE BACKGROUND ARE MORE LIKABLE.","5","27 January 2014"
